0	It worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely.. so basically a small waste of money.
2	does not have the need amps to charge things like ipads or hp touchpads. but its super small and compact.
2	I am disappointed that the 1A didn't work with my iPad.  That's what I get for buying a cheap adapter.
2	After a week only one side works
0	Only works one side at a time. When you connect two cables one side stop working and also overheated burning the fuses. I purchased two of them and it's the same problem. Cheap and bad quality.
2	Didn't last very long. Worked great when it worked but it is a cheap piece of plastic crap so I shouldn't have expected it to last.
2	I bought this so that I could use and charge my Tab at the same time. My tab does not recognize the high power port and will either charge while off or use power while on it will not charge while powered on.
2	I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months it subsequently died on me.Pros:-Has 2 USB ports for charging one (the top) is 2.1 amps.  The bottom slot is lower presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course after this charger died I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring bad design I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.
0	I bought 2 of this and tried to test first ... after few minutes of charging it felt hot. Pulled it out and the product smelled burnt. Tried the other one too and same thing. Be careful... this one could be fire hazard or could potentially destroy the electrical system
2	The idea of the design is a sweet idea but it wears off as the paint is over the case and not under a sealant or anything. It has a cool 3D effect but at the cost of the paint rubbing off.It is quite pretty though.
2	I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots. Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase.
2	It looked like it was used! It was broken when it got to be the paint job was horrible.I would never get it again
0	This case for some reason is peeling there isn't much left of the orginal skin i  loved the case with pink being my favorite color but i wouldn't recommend this specific one for anyone.
0	The charger only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my Samsung Galaxy S3.  They really need to start making these chargers better....I've been thru several!!!!
2	It works great  thus  far no issues.  The only thing i might have limited was a usb Connect or it charges my t989 without fail
0	JUNK!!!......This product must be miss labeled.  I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger.  The lights are on the phone says its charging but nothing happens.  I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is very upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge.  If you need a reliable charger DO NOT purchase this product.If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2 I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter.  It charges fast and is dependable.
2	The Samsung car charger has stopped working within a 6 month period.  I thought a fuse was blown inside the unit but when I attempted to change it I've noticed that it doesn't come apart like most vehicle chargers.
2	WHAT A GREAT PRICE!RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX PLUG N UPLOAD SUM JUICE ...DON'T KNOW IF DROPPING IT REPEATEDLY ON THE FLOORBOARDOR OCCASIONALLY STUFFING IT IN CONSOLE TO HIDE CAUSED FAILURE ...BUT SOON THE GREEN LIGHT FAILED TO LIGHT AND PHONES DISPLAY SHOWEDIT WASN'T CHARGING. SO EITHER SPEND SEVERAL MORE DOLLARS FOR ONE WITHA HEAVIER CORD/STRONGER SHELL OR TREAT IT AS A DELICATE FLOWER.
0	Plugged into the car and worked the first couple of days. Hasn't worked since. My phone does not even recognize it's plugged in.
2	You have to hold it in a certain place in other for it to charge. I'll just buy the Verizon  charger instead
0	This thing worked well when it actually functioned but today it stopped working and I am past the 30 day return window by 10 days give or take.I'm guessing the quality might not be great as that is why it stopped working who knows.. What a waste of money.
0	First this is kind of cheap-looking but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone so that's forgiveable.  The springs on the side don't have much force though so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port.  The cable is sturdy but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle.  It's held up well since I purchased it though.UPDATE:  Stopped charging after a month.
2	I have had 3 phone chargers go bad in two weeks. I can not say where I purchased them. Most chargers for cell phones are cheaply made. This one is OK I guess.
2	Got this to replace a frayed OEM cord. The cord itself is ok ;however the plug that looks like OEM and is stamped as such is crap! Took 8 times longer to charge with this unit! When the cord was paired with the actual OEM plug in it worked fine. So if you need a cord its ok; however it is definitely not OEM and the plug is worthless. For the price and really just needing a cord it is a good value but I am very disappointed with the false markings as OEM when it is certainly not.
0	I received this product in a very timely manner which was delightful however I gave it as a gift and was embarrassed to find out it was a defective item. I was reimbursed for the product but would have much rather had a product that worked the first time.
2	It worked fine for a few days then I had to change to cord........The charger itself working fine up to this point..........Rather than send it back I bought another cord from sprint for $19.00
2	I thought this would be a Samsung product but look like a cheap counterfiet. It came crushed and is slow to charge my phone.
0	Had all the marking of a legit samsung product but the cord stop working after 3 days. I'm not upset because it was very inexpensive but maybe you should spend a little more and buy a better product off amazon. When it did work it worked very well.
2	First off the charger works just as it should and all the ports stay connected just fine.People in other reviews were complaining that the cord was too short-- about 2 or 3 feet-- and that was what I was expecting. Instead I got a 5 foot cord which is a bit long for the purpose I was going to use it for (in my car). Now I have a long cord dangling everywhere. That extra length may be a bonus for most but I bumped down the rating due to seller's lack of description and/or consistency. Also I'm fairly certain the product image was changed because when I ordered it a different style adapter was pictured... I was expecting a square shape with the USB port on the side; I got the longer rectangle shape with the USB port on the end... hmm. There's no way to verify that now.In sum: Good charger with good connectivity looks and acts like it's an original Samsung.  Cord length and adapter style may vary as it seems like the seller is not consistent.
0	This charger doesn't charge the battery of my Samsung Galaxy S2 (i9100) properly.When I connect it to my S2 the screen gets frozen and the cell behaves in a unusual (abnormal) way.
2	Was here right on time.Wall adapter what I expected and works well but dose Not Have Quick-Charge As This ad states and that was theWhole reason I chose this chager so that is horribly disappointing and inconvenient ..... The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well....I know its the usd because I tried it in several devices and adapters and it had the same problems....I Will never order from Amazon Again Only two orders out of 13 have come without Defect or Wrong Probuct!Ugh!
2	I would like to start off by saying that this product is what I ordered and I have no complaints about shipping or the condition of the product when it came to my house the problem I do have is the micro usb cable that comes with the charger. Why is it that all of the different companies that sell chargers on Amazon can get the plug part of the charger right but not the micro usb cord? The cord is cheap and not the original cord that comes with the other part of the charger. I am having the same issue with the charger that I ordered for my galaxy note 2. It's a very thin cord and also very short. Maybe a 2 21/2 foot cord? And its of a cheaper quality than the part of the charger that the micro usb plugs into...
0	In a nutshell this is NOT an OEM charger.  Although it has the Samsung markings it doesn't seat well with a Samsung phone.  This means that it's either meant for another market or it's counterfeit.  With that said I wouldn't buy this again.~~~~~~~~~~August 17 2013 - UpdateThe seller tried to make amends by sending me three replacement chargers.  After using this for a while it is still garbage.  It does not charge my phone and in fact it drains the phone.  This must be a counterfeit product.  It has Samsung markings but it does not charge the phone.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!
0	After 2 weeks my charger just fell apart while i was taking it from the plug  not a strong charger at all i would have asked for my money but it wasn't even worth it .
0	This one came in broken  The bottom pice snaps on to the sides and the main backing is a inlay piece. Came in scuffed with paint and the pieces will not click in together. If it was not broken I would like it. Also if it wasn't in three click in pieces
0	I never do this but I almost bought this product based off of the amazing sounding fake reviews provided by the shills for PowerBear. If you look at all the positive reviews for this case you will see that none of them are verified purchases and yet every negative review other than this one of course is a verified purchase. What that means is that everyone who has actually bought and used this product thinks that it is crap. Furthermore many of the reviewers have posted twice on this product once per color. Why Amazon allows this is beyond me but that is not the point. Also if you look at the profiles of the positive reviewers you will see that they have posted multiple positive reviews for PowerBear products and many of the reviews are carbon copies of each other. Beware the paid shills!
0	Watch-out all these positive reviews are fake. Some have even reviewed it twice using the same name. What a sleazy way to sell an item.
0	i was raving to a friend about how amazon has great phone cases and how cheap they are and bought him this. it didn't even fit his phone right. poorly made.
2	I bought this for the at&t samsung galaxy s2 and the seller was very slow in getting this item to me. I also notice that this product do fit the SGS2 but the cut outs was NOT good. The cut out opening was too small for the power button there was also an extra cut out for no reason. It does fit nice so I gave it 2 stars but bad opening for my phone will be costly.
0	the case did not fit my phone; was a tad too small.  i could only get 3 corners into the case.  i wound up buying a two piece case that cost about $20 from a local store.  have dropped the phone so many times the case is beat to s*** and no damage to the phone.  good reason to buy a case just not this one.my co-worker delayed in getting a case because he could not find one he liked and broke the display screen making his phone unusable.  buy a case not this rubber thing.  i threw mine away within 5 minutes of it's arrival
0	I read the first few reviews and didn't read any further and now I wish I had cause this thing does not work for the Sprint Galaxy s2. Wish I had known that.
2	Be careful when ordering these cases. Not all Galaxy II's are the same. Mine was a Sprint and this one did not fit my pnone. It went into the trash can as it wasnt worth sending back. Otherwise I am sure it's a great case.
2	I was expecting a bit higher quality product but it is what it is. I've used it for a few months and it definitely helped when I dropped my phone. But at this point I am not using it anymore due to the quality of the product although 'good' it could be better and more solid.
0	there is a different between the size/design of Galaxy II that is carried by USA and what's carried by Asia.  I'm in USA I ordered the cover for Galaxy II that i bought from USA the cover didn't fit and the speaker location is different from the phone.  I copmared the cover to another Galaxy II that is sold in Asia and i found that the design is different.So if you bought Galaxy II from USA don't buy cover from outside USA
2	A note of caution from someone who owned and used just about every major Blackberry model: if you already own a standard USB 2.0 cable and you don't need an extra then you do NOT need this cable. All a Blackberry needs for data transfer is a STANDARD USB 2.0 cable with a Micro-USB connector at one end.There is NOTHING special about this cable and nothing justifies the artificially inflated MSRP listed for it. While this item is sold at a 90% off the MSRP discount it's probably okay to purchase one for as long as after reading the first paragraph you decide that you will need a USB 2.0 cable.The items has 2 stars taken away for the exaggerated marketing claim (professional grade custom cable) and for the inflated MSRP.NOTE: Please make sure that you buy cable with a MICRO-USB connector because this is what your Blackberry needs.
2	I bought this micro usb cable because it was cheap and that it is. I use this with my Nexus s 4g from sprint and although it does indeed charge my device it causes some major issues such as screen lag my computer not being able to recognize what kind of device this is and causing my phone to constantly jump into car mode. So if you need a real quick cable for basic charging this will do it anything else...spend the extra buck on a higher end cable.
0	I purchased 3 of these cables because they were cheap and got good reviews.  I don't know how people are getting these cables to work... but out of the 3 I bought 0 have functioned properly with my Palm Pre!  The best I can do is get it to charge though the entire time it is charging the computer is complaining about Unknown Device and Could not install drivers even though it works beautifully with the original cable.  The only setting that works is Just Charge!  Each of the 3 cables fails slightly differently which makes me believe that each has a different flaw!  I've tried this with my Wife's Palm Pixi as well as used different computers and that failed as well.  Look elsewhere when attempting to purchase a cable for your Palm device!
0	This cable not recommended for this device. That is what I get for an error message. Plus it is really short.
2	I was really impressed by the price and was very excited when it arrived. But it doesn't work like it says it does. At first it charged my phone just fine but then it stopped charging; I waited a day to charge again but it still didn't charge.
2	well bought this so i could have a spare cord since i have the original cord in my car with a usb charger there got tired of keeping track where i had it last.  so this cord works on when plugged into the wall.  when hooked to a pc phone wont stay connected to the pc to transfer files or anything.  so if you just need a cord to plug into the wall this will work but don't even think of this cord if you want to use it with a pc.
0	poor manufacturing quality the connector is too long and does not properly fit in my phone. I would not buy this.
2	cable works fine with my verizon Galaxy S4 it charges and transmit the data fine.However connector tip(phone side) is too thick it won't fit if you use aftermarket cases.
0	The cable is good but it does not fit the Samsung Galaxy S4. It does plug in but not far enough in to hold securely.
2	It works and is a good value for the price compared to the retail stores. The only negative is that it is just a tad too short.
2	I have purchased many chargers for my Samsung phone on amazon and honestly the quality is just so so on them.  Maybe I'm just really hard on chargers but I feel like they should last more than a few months.  Spend the money and get a good quality one.
0	I got this to charge my Samsung Galaxy S2 but it ALWAYS came unplugged from the phone whenever the phone would be moved it falls out and even just resting on a flat surface it would eventually find its way out of the phone. I had to buy another USB cord because I became very frustrated with this
2	Works fine IF you don't move the phone.  If you handle the phone the plug works its way out within two or three minutes.  This despite a relatively stiff fit.  Note that the cord that came with the phone plugs in smoothly and securely.  That's my general-use cord now; this one is relegated to overnight charging where the phone isn't being used.
0	Disappointed at how cheap they are and doubt they were designed for newer devices.  They are also very short.  Took a long time to ship.  Specifically purchased due to the ad saying they were for Samsung Galaxy devices.  It did not work in my S4.  They require a good charger a d one that is newer and better.
0	damaged charger. when i recieved it the charger had a short in it. i had to wiggle the cord for my phone to charge.
2	This charger doesn't work very well. When plugged in it shows that it is charging but after ten minutes I'm lucky to get 1% more on my battery. I only use it now if my battery is low and I want to keep it from getting lower...that's really all it's good for.
0	I was pretty upset to find that one day it stopped charging my phone right in the middle of a long trip. FFFFFFUUUUUUU...
2	It works that's about all that can be said for it. It charges my Galaxy fine but cord does not retract. Mine came with a busted spring. Cheap enough I don't care not worth the shipping to return. It charges I suppose that's all that matters
2	Looking at the price I ordered 2 of these.It served the purpose initially. But in few months one of them stopped working.that's 50% hit rate. Though I don't what's the life for the other charger.
2	Initially it is a great charger at a great price. However I've been through 2 now and they tend to not last very long. For the price though I guess it's still not a bad deal.
2	The charger works fine.  It was a great value considering how much they cost in stores.  However it doesn't retract at all.
2	The plug fits and it charges my Captivate it felt rather snug. The retractable-ness of this charger is anything but. Plain ol' doesn't work. I literally took it out of the package and the first time I pulled the cord out - didn't yank tug or otherwise forcefully pull it - about 10 inches and hit the retract button to test it out and it retracted about 2 inches of it. I pulled it out further retracted about 4 or so inches of it. Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger versus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get. The cable would only automatically retract 2-4 inches at any given length. The main reason I wanted this was for the retractability since I hate having cables dangling around.Working on getting a refund for this item now.
2	I like how long the cord is with this changer so that I'm able to reach the night stand and table from where I plug it in at.  However I'm not a fan of how long it seems to take to charge to full charge nor how it atomically &#34;stops&#34; charging at certain times on it's own.
0	I was very pleased with this item when I got it back so quickly because it was a gift. However I cannot give a 5 star rating for a product that never worked.
0	The Phone charger works it charges the phone. However while the phone is charging it continually beeps as when the battery is too low.It will not stop beeping while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage.I do not think this is the correct charger to be using on the phone I have.Now I am worried based on other reviewers that the battery may blow on the phone and I'll have to replace that too.I would not recommend buying this charger.The charger from my old blackberry works better.
2	When i went to take the charger out of my wallit snapped in half. Lesson learnedcheap things break too quickly.
2	Product came really fast nice long cord which was great considering factory cord is so short. Worked great til the third day then I don't know what happened...at the price I didn't expect perfection and at Sellers defenseI have not contacted them..it could easily be my own fault and I've been so busy...even review is late. (Sorry)
0	it was the wrong one.The male end does not fit the Iphone 4s .  Once it was pulled out it would not retract
0	THIS IS A BAD CHARGER IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY AND IT HAS A REALLY BAD SHORTAGE. I HATE IT!
2	good
2	This headset works fine but I expected somewhat better sound quality for the price. Also have not been able to get it to work with my Samsung Galaxy I'm guess that was an issue with the 2.5 to 3.5 mm plug adapter I got since it works fine with my panasonic cordless phone. Not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone however which is what I am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poor.
2	Excited about this based on good reviews but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound.  I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell and they said the problem went away so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also just FYI this does not come retail packaged but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions.  Not a problem for me but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality.
2	I've tried and returned at least 5 headsets ranging from $15 to $150. This one was typical of the others that I returned low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone. I finally ended up with a Panasonic TCA60 for about $19 which is very loud and sounds great on both ends. It's nothing fancy no volume control and no mute but who needs that when you can accomplish the same thing with your phone. Price does not determine sound quality. I recommend this product.
2	The only problem with this headset is that people you are talking to will have trouble hearing you.  This is pretty important to me so I only give it 2 stars.  I have used it extensively with both my cell phone and my cordless phones at home with the same problem.
2	I don't think this will last very long.  I was thinking of deploying this in a call center environment but I don't think it would last very long.  Plus the cord is too short for desktop use.
2	The one plastic wedge broke on first use.  Otherwise it is about what I expected.  A usable set of tools for phones and some laptops.
2	The Torx screw drivers work wonderfully and the tweezers work well but the pry tool is too weak and ineffectual for the project I used them on.I bought this kit to remove the cameras out of my HTC 4G LTE and I didn't have any problems except for removing the small plastic portion on the bottom rear side of the phone.  The pry tool was way too flimsy for the job and I'm not convinced that it would do the trick for any similar function.I'd recommend this kit if you primarily purchased it for the Torx drivers but not if you require the use of the pry tool as well.
0	Installation was easy and the tool kit worked though the plastic tools are no the robust and will break if you tweak on them too much. The paper foil was coming off the battery when I open the package but folding back in place worked once it's in the phone it is not an issue. So far the phone charges fast and the life is much better than the 2 year old battery it replaced. So far I would recommend this battery.Update: 4 weeks after installing this battery is would only last 5 hours and that was barely using the iPhone with NO voice calls at all during that time and no extra heavy use of the internet or anything. Drained it and charged from dead several times made sure that location services blue tooth apps closed... all OFF and still drained. Got my money back and bought one for 1/2 the price and that one works great! Maybe I just got a defective battery.... A risk we all take when buying these 3rd party batteries.
2	I haven't used them all yet but they aren't as quality as some of my precision tools.  Like the pry tool and tweezers.
2	the torx is the only real useful tool in here for the evo4g. not a big fan just use a credit card instead
0	Seeing is how the 2 5 star reviews on this item are from fake users who seem to be trash talking other iphone battery sellers and 5 staring there own is pretty messed up so therefore it appears this seller is some type of scammer.
2	Pros- Good tool set if you need to take things apart.Cons- They came in a plastic bag (no case)- They're extremely flimsy plastic that makes me feel like if I use them over 10 times they're going to break.I don't recommend this at all and would recommend you buy something other than this.
2	Judging from what I've seen in other reviews and what I received there is inconsistency in what is being shipped out.  I received a zip-lock bag containing 12 pieces. (See user uploaded photo that matches the description below)- 6 Torx type drivers magnetic tip (T4T5T6T7T8T10) (Orange handle with blue cap)- 1 Philips driver magnetic tip (black handle)- 1 Flat driver magnetic tip (black handle)- 1 3-point driver magnetic tip (clear red handle)- 2 tweezers (stainless steel on blister packs)- 1 pry tool (dark green)I purchased this set to do some work on a Droid X (MB810) and they did the job well enough except I had to carefully use the T4 instead of a T3 *very* carefully on 12 screws holding the screen assembly together. I'll give it a 3 star rating It's OK
0	Battery would not charge in iPhone. iPhone shut down after 2 minutes of being powered up. Had to throw it away.
2	i bought these tool to us for repairing my nephews iphone 4 but non of them were the right size so if you buying them for the iPhone don't buy these
2	These are all torx drivers there is no flathead or phillips in this set which is going back to Amazon today.
2	It has a lot of what I need to do basic repairs on a phone but it is bare bones.
2	Could have been better for the price and wait time. 2 of the drivers are labeled as a 1.5 but are clearly different sizes. Also the wear kinda fast if working with tight screws
0	Really poor quality tweezer bent like nothing screw drivers made of cheap plastic adhesive removing tool again cheap plastic you get what you pay for would not recommend to anyone who is trying to perform phone surgery
2	Not the best ive purchased but it came with the right size for iphone 4 but the ones with the yellow handles are really just different sizes for a star screw and none of them fits the iphone 4 star screw. You can always use it for another gadget though.
0	I received it today and it doesn't charge. I'm sure it is used - I found a piece of broken iPhone glass on the contact side.
2	It's $6 so I don't know if I'm asking too much. The screw drivers work and are slightly magnetized. The prying tool is completely junk and broke before I had even finished my task - a guitar pick is much more durable. The tweezers are also worthless. Get them for the screwdrivers not for the other tools.
2	I purchased this battery to replace a water soaked one in an iPhone 4. I don't even know if it is charging or not as the unit won't turn on for me. The shipping is prompt the packaging great and the description is accurate.
2	I'm sure that there is something that says it will not come as pictured but still I was disappointed.The tools helped me get the job done but they also did not hold up well. The plastic plying tools bent and broke fairly quickly. I can't say that it wasn't user error but they seemed very cheap.
2	Purchased this to remove screws on my Samsung Galaxy SII but even the smallest tool in the set was too large.
2	not badbut Too little things inside is incomplete and the bad use of hexagonal. But it is ok . thanks
2	Had a mix up with getting the item and slow shipping but it was all resolved in the end so I am satisfied with the purchase
2	the tools are ok Just not quite what I  expected.  They were however better than the ones that came with the screen I ordered.
2	You get what you pay for. They strip easily. VERY cheaply made. But I only needed them for a one time use and I didn't have to spend a bunch of money so I can't really complain. But if you will need them more than once...spend the money on good tools.
0	The eargels fit to the earpiece is fine nice and tight but as far as actually getting ANY of the sizes to comfortably fit FORGET IT
0	I got these for my jawbone headset. Many had said they work great. but for the life of me i cant figure out how you get them to work short of superglue and even then they are too quiet to hear so i guess they work on the jabra they are designed for but not the jawbone.
2	On the recommendations of a few reviewers I tried these gels for my Jawbone headset. Unfortunately they did not fit well and came off every time I took the headset off. That was too bad because they did seem somewhat comfortable and did direct the sound into my ear for a louder and clearer sound. However I returned them because of the poor fit. They would probably work well on some other headsets. If they fit your headset then I would give these gels a try.
0	When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II they were fantastic.  They fit my ear canal perfectly negating the need for the ear loop that came with it.  Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset.  The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear.  I tried washing and drying them thoroughly but that only helped for an hour or so.  I am not sure what the fit problem is but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all.
0	these were advertised to fit the habra stone.  they did not. i don't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it. not even one piece fit.  threw them away
0	I bought these so my headset would be more comfortable...These hurt your ears just like the one that comes with it no matter what size you use. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone...Don't waste your money.
2	These are the exact ones that I was looking for but there is one problem.  They are supposed to be clear but they arrived yellowed in the package.  It is obvious that they are new but they have yellowed and are no longer clear.  I bought these to replace existing ones that I have that have yellowed but not to the extent of these new ones.  I have had the previous ones since 2010.  I will keep as spares but am unhappy with the condition of these EarGels.
2	The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable at least for me.  It's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear and forget about jogging wearing this.  Also the insert comes off very easily and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears you need to find the other sizes of the insert.  Sound quality is mediocre as callees often complain about wind noise from my end.  I'm not happy with these.
2	Jabra makes by far the best hands-free devices on the market.  This particular model the EarBoom is not with it's faults.  However it will meet your needs for the most part if you figure out it's peculiarities.Jabra provides multiple ear gels for comfort and for left ear or right ear use.  The criticism that they are hard to get used to is valid.  You have to try putting them in different ways till you figure it out.  The instructions are not a substitute for trial and error I suppose.As for the hands-free jack on your phone you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack.  That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug.  Unfortunately a specific compatibility list is hard to come by.  Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine despite the short arm.  If you find people are telling you your voice is muffled you must slighly twist the microphone head.  I have found that sometimes if it is at the wrong angle it will not capture sound as well.  The arm is flexible enough that it can be adjusted slightly.I also prefer the EarWave Boom or the EarWrap which have wraparound ear attachments and a slightly longer more solid arm.  The Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie.  Personally I don't like those models.  I have not found much difference in sound quality though the EarWave Boom and the EarWrap are somehow easier to figure out.For difficulty of use and for a microphone arm style that I just don't like I have docked this unit 2 stars.  It should be noted that none of Jabra's newer models have this microphone arm any longer  But this is good bang for the buck.  Try other higher end models if you are more demanding like I am and are willing to spend the money.
2	These things were terrible.  The &#34;Boom&#34; would keep pulling the ear but out of my ear and I couldn't keep anything in place. The cord was very flimsy... It was just an all around bad buy.  Wouldn't do it again.
2	Not really worth getting.Except for very limited application this is not an good way to connect a audio device to the car stereo.this item creates a bunch of mechanical noise and in addition the sound quality from the attached device is very poor. It works but is not worth listening to unless one has to.  As limited as the fm transmitters are they have significantly better sound quality.  I'd return this except it would cost more to ship than it is worth.
2	My moms car couldn't have an upgraded radio (freaking saabs...) but one of the two positions didn't work. Still worked for her though.
2	Great for the price.  Sound quality is not what it should be I think but my kids love it.  I like the idea and am going to buy one for my car but a different brand to see if there is a difference in sound.
0	I tried using it with my Sansa Clip MP3 player in my Toyota MR2. The car makes a lot of noise in any case so I'm not holding out for audio lab quality. However the product made a quite audible (at low automobile speeds) click-click-click. I might have been able to tolerate that. However there was also an electronic whistle increasing in frequency with the RPM of the engine. The whistle interfered excessively with the intended sound from the player. The volume of the Coby CA-747 was ok. I hadn't thought that would be an issue until I bought a comparable Maxell cassette adapter at Long's to replace the Coby CA-747. The volume with the Maxell product was very weak and I had to turn it way up. The Maxell didn't go click-click-click but it whistled too. So both the Maxell and the Coby get 1 star from me. I'm trying out the offering from Philips next...
2	This item doestn work on 2001 Chevy suburban.I tried too many things to get it work but no chances anyways dual position thing is good for using with different players.
2	I opened it and didn't see where the springs were.. If anybody can take a pic or describe it I will love u so much. Good product but i was getting the reel error on my tape display in my ford expedition. It makes my blackberry phone sounds great. Dislike the radio so please help me.
0	very disspointed not getting a coby cassette tape because it did not work in my car :/ i need my music
2	Seems great at first. But sound is kind of shaky almost like the magnetic head is not making good contact. Also it has a bad habit of locking up the wheels and it makes the radio think it's hit the end of the tape and will auto reverse only to find it locked again and then reverse again. It'll get stuck in this infinite loop. You have to take it out smack it a few times to free up the wheels and then put it back in. Oh and that plug for the cable on the tape is loose as hell. pull on your device too quickly and it'll put the plug right out of the tape while its still in the deck.
2	I fixed the issues for the time being.  I turned down the bass on my stereo.  I also made the default volume 75% on my phone.  This is the combination that worked for me.  I also left the casette in.  I figured if there was dust and other stuff in there then i would have to let it settle.  The burn in period was about 3 days.  Afterwards it was AMAZING the sound clarity improved so much. So don't give up try these things. You may need to clear the dust from inside your tape player I'm sure that may be the cause of many issues.Fix eject issue:[...]
0	But will keep this short and sweet -Cord contains lead and must be handled regularly in a car where there is nowhere to clean your hands after touching the thing.Sound quality quickly goes downhill with crackling evident after only 5 uses.Now stuck in my dashboard player because the modular adapter broke off and the cassette will not fully eject. I am sure the husband will be griping the entire time he tries to get it unstuck.Avoid at all costs!I scanned past the negative reviews since this product had a few really positive reviews with a lot of helpful votes. Big mistake as now I have to unstick the adapter from my cassette player and try to get Amazon to take it back. (I bought 2 on clearance)
0	These things are just a confidence trick. They don't do a thing. They can't do a thing. If you believe these make your phone work better then you probably find the stripes down the side of cars make them go faster too.
0	Come on Amazon I can't really believe you are selling this under your own name!
0	This thing is a waste of paper it doesn't give u any better reception. This is a total rip off in my book :-(
2	I would like to say that this is not cheap junk but it did nothing at all for my cell reception.On the other hand I have an iPhone with AT&T; so it could be that combination doesn't work with it.It appears it worked for a few people with a different phone so I am going to be generous and give it 2 stars taking into account it could have been my unit.;-)
2	I gave it 3 stars because I was generously sent a bunch of these on only one order.  Otherwise I am not so sure that these work very well.  I have tried on 2 phones and the results have been inconclusive.
0	Want to try one? They sell these at the dollar stores. It does nothing to improve your signal.
0	Didn't work It did not work at all. I have a dead spot when I drive to work where I totally lose the Signal. This device did not help at all. DO NOT WASTE your money on it. even for less than $2.00 its not worth anything.
0	i cant say it works because i tryit for a long time on my iphone and it didnt made a difference at all...
2	I purchased this for my sisters phone. She continually has calls dropped so I got her this signal booster and it hasn't made a bit of difference. I bought these before for my previous cell phones and they really seemed to help. But apparently not so much anymore.
0	Contrary to what this site and T-Mobile lead me to believe T-Mobile could not provide coverage at my home address.  This did not stop Amazon.com from selling me the phone nor T-Mobile from transferring my existing (working) AT&amp;T number to their service (of course this took two weeks and &gt; 10 phone calls).After receiving no reception I called T-Mobile and was informed that they do not actually cover my area.I called AT&amp;T back and they happily attempted to restore my account only to find that T-Mobile refused to release the numbers.After a month of essentially no coverage from anyone my phones are happily back on AT&amp;T where they belong.The bad news is that T-Mobile has sent me a bill for more than double the quoted monthly rate and Amazon.com has not refunded my purchase price.Even in areas where I could get coverage the phone itself did not work well.  After pressing more than a few keys the screen would lock up and I needed to remove the battery to reset it.Last warning:  Watch out for the charges for inbound messages--if you really dislike a T-Mobile subscriber send them lots of text messages (free from their site)--the subscriber has to pay $0.05/message.
2	the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $20.  Sony took my address and said they would but it never showed up.Well the phone is rugged!  It's been 3-4 years and it still works.  It went through the washing machine and half the dryer.  It was submerged in a puddle for 30 minutes-  it keeeps working.The blue tooth syncs w/ my pc and tells me where to go etc.  I buy  a $25 access card every couple of months and avoid the taxes.  It's been a great little phone.
2	Great features - except for the phone one.  Seriously - Bluetooth IR good phone book features nice color display (though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses).  However I get much weaker signals (and call quality) on this phone vs. my previous one.  If everywhere you would use the phone has strong signals you may be just fine - but if you are on the edge this is not the phone for you unless you value the non-phone features more than it working as a phone. :)
2	I just called T-Mobile with complaints about my weak battery and told them talk time on the cell phone is 840min according to Amazon's specs for the T610 phone. T-mobile told me the talk time is 5 hours (300min). Who do you believe? I am tired of liars and money-gobbling b*st*rds!
2	Considering how old the phones that use this type of battery are I am not surprised that I received a used battery. I am a little mad at the fact that the product listing said these batteries would be new though. The battery I received holds the charge for about a day which is the same as my old one.Disappointing indeed.
2	This serves the purpose if you need your hands free.  You get what you pay for but I don't need to use it very often so it is compatible with my phone and is easy to use--not much you can mess up!  If you need one that you will use a lot you may want to buy something more advanced but this is a good backup and was very inexpensive.
2	Overall it's a great headset for the price. Pretty amazing actually. You'll need to get a wired converter to convert the 2.5mm to 3.5mm like this one:Headset Adapter 3.5mm to 2.5mm Audio Adapter and Converter (Black) - Non-Retail Packaging. No biggie.But the curved rubber piece is really stiff and hurts my ear after about 30 minutes or less. Sometimes quite painfully.I have a dull voice and this is by far the best headset I have that helps people hear me clearly (I actually have an older version of the same headset so I have two). No one complains they can't hear me or do they need to turn up their volume. Noise cancellation is also pretty good. Not as good as my cheap jawbone but then people usually complain they can't hear me as well on that one. So stay away from this if you plan to talk on the phone a while or have larger ears. Small ears may work just fine. Mine are probably about average for males. Otherwise worth the price.
0	It doesn't fit my phone and now I must return it. What a hassle! That's all I have to say!
0	I ordered this based on the rave reviews I saw for it.  I am using it with a Treo 600 and I can barely hear anything out of the ear piece even with the spongy covering removed.
2	As with so many Plantronics headsets that I have owned the problem is with the connector jack the movement of the wire causes the headset to loose contact with the plug-in jack which at that point they are ready for the garbage bin. When they are new they work very very good excellent sound quality.
2	This is actually a lightweight comfortable phone headset.  The problem with it is that when the phone rings and you go to pick it up it takes a while to attach to your ear.  Also the speaker part is covered by some foam that picks up ear wax and gets dirty extremely quickly - not an item you would want to share with someone.  Once you get past these two problems the sound quality is good and it is easy to wear.
2	This didn't work in my phone. It was rather cheap I ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made!
2	I got sick of xbox 360 microphones breaking so I decided to buy this to see if it would work.Unfortunately it didn't work that well. I got sound and the microphone worked but I got a lot of feedback and echo. Worst of all it was supposed to block outside sound but it didn't do this at all.I know that it was designed for xbox so I am not going to give it 1 star. I don't have a home phone so I haven't tried it for that.
0	This item is useless.  The plug is far too small to fit my phone despite the description that this will fit LG phones.  I own the DARE and this doesn't fit.  The DARE uses the standard jack while this thing is the 2.5 mm whatever.  Who uses such a tiny plug? I've NEVER seen that size on any cell phone!  You get what you pay for.  This item is a joke.
2	This headset would not stay in my ear no matter how hard I tried.  I like the fact that it is small that it sounds OK and that the person on the line could hear me OK (not great) But I could not figure out how to keep it in my ear without holding it which defeats the purpose of having a headset!! I ordered 4 of them they were about $3 apiece with shipping and the first two are buzzy and could not be used.  I would not recommend this product. I went to an over the head headset by Jensen and am VERY pleased!
2	well its a easy product but it is just I hope buy it arrive on time and the way I waiting but it hurt my ear
0	More importantly the point is that the thing that goes in your ear is a cheap thin little foam pad that will wear out very quickly.  When mine arrived it was in little pieces all over the inside if the plastic bag they shipped it in.  No box no packing - not even some cheap bubble wrap and a rubber band just chucked it into a bag.  I realize it's super cheap but it should last a month.  Is there we are at now?  I wish Amazon would be... at all selective on what they offer for sale.
2	Not too sure how to make it stay put but it seems to work well.  I purchased this headset for my mother and she has not complained about it yet!
0	Sound was fine through the headset however the Mic did not work at all.Waste of money and not worth returning.
0	The earpiece is stamped Verizon and is of different finish than pictured. There was no packing slip enclosed but the USPS envelope in came in showed ACCSTOP in Oxnard CA. For $2.47 I guess it doesn't matter but still not the item pictured.  It also came in a little plastic baggie - it was represented as new.Cannot try it as the 3.5mm adapter hasn't arrived from the other item in the earpiece set purchase.
0	I have purchased 4 different Jabra headsets because they are the most comfortable and easy to hear with but they have poor microphone quality. I thought I would try this model the MX150 Flexible Boom. Again sound quality was crap. I make a living on the phone so others being able to hear me is very important.I have ended up getting a Ge Tl26593 Earset Microphone by Jasco which has worked the best so far.
2	Bought this as a gift. Didnt get much feedback from the giftee. But I';m sure its working fine. Price was good not much else to comment on.
2	I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers.  One tried to get it to work and finally gave up.  She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call.  I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset.I have been using the headset she had problems with and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback.One of the five just quit working this week.Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me.I will try a different kind next time...if there is a next time.
2	The product is okay but could be better. The first problem I had was one of the latches came off immediately upon receipt of the item while trying to open it for the first time. One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open. The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now. I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually. Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed?The second problem I had came after flying with it. There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not. I had to use a pocket knife to pry it open which is fine when I am on the ground but not so fine when I am on a plane where I am not allowed to have a knife. Upon returning home after another flight I was able to get the case open without my knife but it was not very easy. Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don't think it will work for my needs.Edited to Add: So far I have not had any issues opening the box while on a plane. I still have problems after I land as sometimes it need to be pried open but at least while in the air it opens fine. I am still using it but be aware that if you fly with it you may need a tool to pry it open after landing.
2	This phone is amazingly small and light for a camera phone; it even has a flashlight/flash. Problems the phone has that I find to be a real problem: 1. The battery life is the worst of any phone I've ever owned. It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don't use it at all; if I use the phone at all even just 10 minutes no more than one day on a full charge. 2. No voice activated dialing. I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer talk or dial. I think all phones should have it. 3. It is not very user friendly. The menus are not logical and are confusing. 4. It has an IR but it doesn't sync with your computer. You can't transfer anything. I don't get why they even have it. They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take but (5) no syncing with Outlook your PDA or anything else. 6. If you buy ring tones or wallpaper you can't back those up.I do love the phone for its size weight and even the color I find it easy to hold and talk with. The sound isn't the best but it isn't bad either. It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy. I can't put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it's a long key the holder makes the camera come on. I had to get a small holder that only grabs in one small area on each side. I've had to purchased 3 additional batteries and every kind of charger available because the average use of a battery is 15 hours (regular phone use for me is: about 10 minutes a day use the &quot;t-zones&quot; for a minute or two once a month in 6 months I've taken a total of 9 photos and transferred data twice). The battery lasted 3 days ONCE when I was home sick and didn't use the phone and one 24 hour day I had to replace the battery three times as they completely discharged. I'm use to a battery lasting 5 to 8 days (like this phone says it will last).I also like T-Mobile. Their customer service is really good the features they offer on their web site are great the prices for wireless modem and wireless web are incredibility great and the national calling price plans are very good compared to what I?ve seen elsewhere. I was with AT&amp;T since they bought out L.A. Cellular. The customer service was great for years but got so bad I?d wait on hold for hours and couldn?t get through to a person for days.
0	This phone is ugly and heavy and has a terrible user interface even for techies like myself.  It also drops calls like crazy here in Manhattan.  The Moto V600 is a much better phone takes better pictures gives you better clarity and reception is smaller and is much much cheaper.  Get the Moto V600 if you want T-Mobile.  Stay away from this ugly monster.
0	I recently moved to Phoenix Arizona and thought it a good time to get a new mobile phone.  A friend recommended Nextel saying we'd use the direct connect function.  Cool.  So I ordered an i730 from Amazon.  After charging and activating and waiting the required day I called to get my phone number.  It was a Palo Alto CA number!?  That's over 700 miles away!  An 11 hour drive to the next state.  No way close to a local number.  Nextel did not seem to understand or care.  &quot;It's the closest we have.&quot;  &quot;There are no 602 area code phone numbers left.&quot;  I begged for maybe a 480 number or anything that is a local call from here in Phoenix.  Nothing doing.  After a few more days and a few more calls to Nextel that went nowhere I called Sprint (who have not been customer service stars to me in the past) and within four minutes had a local 602 Phoenix number working on my current Sprint phone.  I canceled the Nextel service.  They are charging me $35 (expected) plus $11.53 in taxes fees and assessments &quot;we can't change&quot; for a couple of days when all I called was customer service.If you buy the phone I hope Nextel has a local area code for you because if they don't you are stuck for $46.53 and an Amazon return.  It was a pretty color screen though . . .
2	I don't own this phone. I own the cheaper Motorola (Nextel) i710. I have many friends who own this phone though although a few of them have since downgraded to the i710.The main reason I chose the i710 over this i730 was signal strength. the i710 consistently gets better signal the the i730 no matter which of my friends phones I compare it too. All my friends are on the same wireless plan from Nextel as I am so I know its not service it is definitely the phones.I can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars. My phone gets signal in places their phones are Out of Service.Now you might say that maybe my friend just has a dud phone. Well I have 4 friends who have the i730 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860 all from Nextel and the i710's always have better signal compared to the i730's. The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal. The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710 the i730 is a pretty good phone. Lots of features solid and durable construction and good battery life. For me signal was more important that a silver case an an external screen but if you like those things the i730 is a decent phone to use.
2	I will not hash over the things that many other wrote in their reviews but mainly will focus on the problems that I've had with this phone over the course of 1 year that I've had it.1) Battery life is not nearly as good as advertised - lasts about 8 hours - but I admit to be using the phone often and need to swap batteries (have an extra one in the charger) because the wire charger would not charge the phone! (another story altogether) However my cranky old Samsung (a generation prior to e415) used to last 2 full days on an extended battery with same or greater amt of use.2) Familiar problem - phone's earpiece is too quiet.3) Software's pure crap - the phonebook is not only not intuitive it would save phone numbers under different people's names! No not my mistake - checked this several times and then spoke to a sales rep who said that this does indeed occur with this phone.4) Poor reception - the said Samsung had a much better reception in buildings. And it wasn't Sprint service either - T-mobile and Sprint are equivalently bad.5) Setup - very panful to readjust setup options/ringers.Overall I don't like this phone at all. Very poor fundamentals - but it looks cool and has a (very useless but still cool) camera.And judging by Motorolas of my friends (Nextel models aside) I don't think I want to own another Motorola product. When's the new Treo coming out again...?
2	The sound of this headset is excellent as advertised.  The trouble is in getting it to stay in place when I move around.  I'm not talking about playing tennis here I'm talking about driving the car and having the boom slowly swing downwards away from my mouth.  The ear plug stays in place and I can still hear but the boom swings downward from in front of my mouth (pulled by gravity) and then the person I'm talking with can't hear me so well.  The only thing that works for me in this regard is Plantronics the one the hooks behind your ear lobe but that one is not noise-canceling so I can't hear as well when the wind noise gets high in the car.  The ones that hook over my ear hurt me and the ones that just plug into my ear usually fall out.  This one is better in that it stays in my ear but having the boom pivot away from my mouth is a real problem.  I tried bending it so it hangs down from my ear and then swings forward to my mouth but the center of gravity still tries to swing to the lowest point so I'd not a boom twice as long as this for that plan to really work.
2	As you can see by the picture this device has merely an ear canal insert and the microphone and cord just dangle.  It feels a little awkward to me although if you're not moving it does stay in as long as you've pulled your ear back while inserting it which creates a clamp effect between your ear canal and the rubber insert.  The earset itself is light enough to work this way.  The problem is the cable which drags gets bumped by clothing etc and jiggles things.  You have to clip the cable to your collar for sure it's not optional like with over-the-ear headsets.  It comes with a little Y-shaped adapter which lets you use it with SKYPE or other PC-based systems.  Interestingly while this works fine the earset has a little whistle-y electronic noise with Etymotic that I don't hear (no matter how close I listen) with some other earsets I have.  It's not noticeable once a conversation starts. Overall for most use I don't find it's much better than a couple $7 dollar over-the-ear earsets Radio Shack used to stock (no longer do).  It may be as someone reported it's way better for wind noise I haven't tried that.  It comes with a couple fluffy black sponge wind masks for the mike bulb.
0	It's a nice-looking product. It seems like I would have liked it. But...My unit had an electrical problem. I connected two portable external hard drives one powered external hard drive a printer an external DVD+-RW drive a mouse and a keyboard. Then I plugged it in.First I noticed my mouse didn't work. So I unplugged it and plugged in another one. That's strange that one doesn't work either I thought. Hmmm and what's that smell?  Turns out that smell was a hard drive frying.  Once I figured that out I unplugged everything and waited.After a few hours when I figured everything would have cooled down I started testing my devices.  One portable external drive still sort of works. I can see most of the file structure but copying attempts fail. The powered external hard drive mostly worked for a couple days and then quit. One portable hard drive never worked again. The optical drive still works occasionally but typically won't boot. Occasionally the printer works. The mice never worked again. And the keyboard was fine.  Everything's been tested on 3 different PC systems and 1 Linux system.The worst part? Those were my redundant data storage. I lost everything.
2	I gave this 3 stars because it does what it says its nothing high end and doesn't promise miracles but I won't give it 5 stars because simply there's a terrible delay from when my computer comes out of sleep mode and from the time it actually recognizes this hub on the com ports for the PC on average its about 15 seconds.  So I'll be sitting there waiting to enter my password like an idiot until the hub is finally recognized by the PC.  And its a really good PC brand new no problems with USB 2 or USB 3 except where this hub is concerned.
0	For one this product is built very cheap. This means that overtime some ports will simply stop working...why? I'm not really sure...perhaps cheap components and slight bending?Secondly it does not support charging and yet it does at the same time. If you plug in say an apple device you'll get an error but it will charge which again does not make sense.This is not a 3.0 USB hub it's a 2.0. Many new devices will require you to have 3.0 now or in the near future. For instance my new webcam hates being plugged into this hub as the performance greatly drops.Lastly: Mine is just about destroyed because of a slight drink mishap. Nothing seems to be wrong with device other than...it stops working from time to time and I sometimes have to clean the ports with a small amount of water to get it to work again..just very annoying.- Additional Notes: The Stand is horrible. It won't stay on especially if you have multiple cords attached that pull in various directions like the power cable. (It falls out easily it does not snap on it's basically just a slightly heavy stand that it rests on top of. (Useless)- It glows neon Blue. Why? I'm not sure. I like it because it matches my setup but it's very bright and I'd rather the power be used towards the other devices.Finally: This device will likely not support 7 devices being plugged in at the same time....I would get 3-4 to work...maybe.... at any given point. Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to not work entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with. This also made me think there was something wrong with my device and wasted my time trouble shooting. (just had to switch ports) In other words...don't buy this device...get a cheaper hub with more slots or a 3.0 hub with more features.This is cheap...
2	Positives: Bluetooth IR port VGA Camera multiple e-mail accounts speaker phone more programs becoming available for Symbian O/S. I use Bluetooth for wireless headset and to make the phone serve as my wireless modem.Negatives: phone too big; voice recognition worthless low volume from ear piece IR port weak so TV remote control programs don't work well slow menu's and response. Get Opera browser if your phone does not come with it since the WAP browser will only frustrate you (Opera has problems on this phone but works most of the time). T-Mobile programmed the backlight in the display to turn off after a few seconds although Nokia made it adjustable and T-Mobile won't fix it.
2	This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset handheld or desktop computer). My old Siemens s56 on the other hand worked beautifully with all of the above.If you hunt around the web you will find many websites with people complaining about the lack of drivers for this phone and the cavelike silence from Nokia when asked for help.If your needs are limited to making phonecalls and taking snapshots this phone will probably satisfy you. If you need Bluetooth stay away.
2	It works OK although several folks have said that it was hard to hear me.  Not everyone though so there could have been other factors.  The thing I like least is that it is hard to put on.  Maybe it is just me.  I'm accustomed to using headsets but haven't found a quick way to put this on one-handed.
2	i had heard so many good things about this headset and even tried on my co-workers before i bought it but what i didn't test out was the reception/range. i have been using a logitech mobile freedom headset for almost a year now and love it EXCEPT for the fit. it fits horribly.this is where the BT205 shines. it fits great. it doesn't hurt. i can wear it for hours. it seems to have a ton of talk time (at least 6 hours i would say)...but the reception just plain sucks. i don't know if it's all the electrical devices running in my apartment but damn i can't get more than about 5 feet away from my phone before this unit starts to get all crackly on me. you almost have to have the phone 1) within about 6 feet of you and 2) have it on the same side of your body as the jabra. basically count on walking around with your phone in your pocket.do heed jabra's warnings about the wireless home network interfering with this device! and your microwave. and your electric fans...and running water...they all make reception horrible. i think my problem might have been the wireless home network. but c'mon people us geeks who use bluetooth headsets are the same geeks who have wireless home networks. duh.summary:pros:*lightweight*comfortable*got a good price on ebay ($42 shipped for new)*easy to usecons:*range range range! this is a huge one for me. if i have to keep my phone within 6 feet of me all the time what's the point?*too costly at $80 for what you get*everything interferes with this unit. you might as well go sit in a room with nothing in it for good reception.needless to say it's for sale on ebay!
0	I tried this out because my old Bluetrek that I loved died.  Actually I killed it when I forgot where it was and sat on it.  I was impressed with the advertised battery life and took the plunge.  Shouldn't have.  While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body the connection gets fickle.  You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight.  Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology doesn't it?  And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it.  So if yo get this be prepared to anger your party on the other line.  On the plus side the sound is nice and loud in th speaker.  That's about it.  Try something else like a bluetrek or motorola or something.  I am trying the Motorola next.  This thing is trash.
2	Magnetic mounting is a joke.  It is guaranteed to fall over scratch your roof and generally be a pain in the buttocks.I wish this antenna were offered with a NMO mount.  It would be very nice to mount this securely and well worth the trouble and effort to achieve a good mechanical and electrical connection to an auto roof.
2	This antenna works well but the mini is better.  The main complaint is the wind whistels through the coil so it must be set way back on the roof.  No sound from the mini dual band version and just as good reception.Update 5-28-10: Actually the mini has much better reception
0	Amazon continues to ship this antenna with the Wilson Electronics Sleek Booster and it is not the right antenna. Wilson has told them many times they are shipping the wrong antenna but they continue to do it. This was very frustrating and caused me a lot of grief as I was not able to get on the Internet for a week due to Amazon's problem. I am returning the whole package to Amazon even though Wilson Electronics was able to send me an adapter in the next week or so but the primary reason I purchased this product was to use over the Holidays where the place we were staying had little reception.  Not being able to use my smartphone hot spot really made me angry.  There is not excuse for this as Amazon has been told many times by Wilson Electronics that they are sending customers the wrong product.
0	They claim this works for Sprint PCS but I got one for my Virgin Mobile MC760 and it won't pick up any signal! In fact it actually makes the signal weaker!  I have to put the MC760 in a window to get a decent signal so I thought putting an antenna on the roof would be better but when I plug it into the MC760 the signal strength goes down! I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it doesn't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive. I tried emailing Wilson but they weren't any help. Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760. I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work. The first one had bad threads and wouldn't go on all the way the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it. The third one finally did fit correctly but there was still no signal. I don't see how Wilson can get away with selling worthless junk antennas like this they must get a lot of consumer fraud complaints. I'm sending this useless antenna back for a refund.I purchased a Wilson 301101 trucker antenna mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great. This one must have been defective.
2	This didn't do much for me. Unfortunately it may not be the blame. Ironically I have a home repeater system after trying a couple of quick fixes (I thought). This was an upgrade to a combination home and mobile solution I tried first before realizing the specific product to get the results I needed for my whole house solution. So in the mobile world I'm sure this would be helpful. It is the system as a whole that needs to be configured to a need which includes area of coverage location type of usage cell frequency and more. So in putting a system together for a whole home solution you'd be wise to call on the manufacturer rather than putting pieces together which may not 'fit' the performance or compatibility of the other components in the system.
0	This headset was a piece of junk right out of the box. I had nothing but problems with it and threw it away after the first day.
2	I have been using the HS810 for 9 months now. I was initially very impressed because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different phones. (The early blue tooth standard isn't really as standard as one might hope!) However it has proven rather fragile. Within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on/off switch.  Did not impact usability so I didn't care.  For the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger (several of my colleagues are having similar problems).  The headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked. I keep the unit in my briefcase so I don't know why it is proving as fragile as it has.  If you can use it (or the similar HS850) with some assurance that it will not be crushed it is a good choice.  Otherwise I suggest looking at other designs.
2	On the positive side the battery life is good.The negatives I'll split into ergonomics sound and RF performance.Ergonomics: It's secure on my big ears but as others have mentioned that seal is nothing more than marketing and window dressing. There aren't many ear mounted devices that I can get on with at all so if you have big ears this may be for you.Sound: Received sound is weak at best if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you. Transmitted sound is also weak apparently I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.RF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can't answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing by the time it's connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.All in all I'd keep looking which is why I'm browsing headsets now.In ten years I really haven't yet found a good headset nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I'd pay a couple of hundred bucks. A decent noise cancelling headset will let you talk in a normal voice while standing between the exhausts of a 1500hp tank engine.
2	This might be the most comfortable BlueTooth headset out thereHowever I've been very upset with connection speeds and call volumeMost people say that they can hear me very well ----- however the connection speeds take forever to establish ---- in addition the call volume is simply too low to even use it regularlyI use a Treo 650 --- I've heard that this headset works excellently with Moto products - your mileage may vary.....UPDATE: I have also tried the Moto 850 ---- sadly it is really no better than the 810 --- there are some volume improvements but the volume is simply too low on my Treo 650 ---- I recommend the Scala 500
2	I have had this headset for several months now and not liking much about this headset other than its long battery life. This headset works OK but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect ie. no background or wind noise and very close to handset. I do like the feature of the headset turning off when boom mike closed because thats where the battery savings comes from. Other than that I find nothing redeeming about this headset I believe Motorola will discontinue this model because of its severe flaws.
0	This pad is extremely unreliable in that it does not stick to my dash and is very poorly made. One thing I will say is my wallet and phone have not fallen from the pad. Unfortunately the pad moves all around.
2	Item was purchased for spouse.  Was not what he really wanted but the item does work for the most part.
0	Even though the package and description stated there was no adhesive there certainly was a white backing too remove and place on dash . I felt the item was very thin and to the touch not sticky at all. There were no groves as competing products and the part that faced up that was supposed to attract and stick was smooth. Overall I was not impressed.
0	I bought 10 of these.  They are the worst product I have ever used.  They DO NOT work as advertised.  Nothing sticks to them
0	The keyboard will connect to an iphone 3GS with iOS 4 but will not reconnect automatically.I did the CTRL + LFT FN + RT FN keys and the light on the keyboard starts flashing.  Then check the bluetooth on the iphone and it discovers the keyboard.  Then when you pair it the iphone will ask you to enter a 4 digit code and press enter on the keyboard.  That part works perfectly.Then you can use the keyboard on the iPhone 3GS.  But when you close the keyboard and the bluetooth connection is broken it will not reconnect when you open the keyboard back up.  I tried pressing keys and waiting.  I checked the bluetooth status on the iphone and it shows not connected.  No matter what I do it will not reconnect.  I have to manually re-pair the keyboard and phone to get it to work.  That makes the keyboard completely useless on the iPhone 3GS with iOS4.  There is a video posted on youtube where another person had the same problem.If anyone was able to get it to work properly with an iPhone 3GS with iOS4 please let me know how you were able to do it.
0	The driver for this device completely broke my Treo 650 fortunately I have Sprint's insurance plan so I was able to get a replacement Treo. I used the latest driver from the Thinkoutside website. If you have a Treo do not get this device.
0	I purchased this product to send over to my wife who is on a trip and complained about typing on a Blackberry. I thought I better install it before sending it after her so I could guide her along. No PC where she is so I tried to download as advertised. Result: Page Not Found.Company advised that since this is a discontinued item (?) they took down the support pages.This would not be an issue normally - you can install the driver from a PC.It is the principle that a company can maintain a manufacturer's description while not the web page to support the claim...You know a manufacturer is a scumbag when their feedback/survey link gives you an error message back...If any doubts read the blackberry link from the bottom of the review page or click on the one star reviews. A shame
0	It seems that this keyboard acts a little like those gold fish you bring home in a plastic bag from the pet shop.  You have to put the whole bag in the tank until it acclimates to it's new surroundings.  I went from wanting to love the thing for the sheer coolness factor....to boxing it up to send back when it wouldn't sync to my Axim x50v....to giving it another chance and after it was good and ready to work flawlessly I now love it again.  The keyboard is smaller than standard but very useable.  It's great for writing a longer e-mail inputting contacts or writing a letter in word when you don't want to peck at the screen with your stylus endlessly.  The construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap.  Pun intended. The only major flaw is with the cradle that holds your PDA.  It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you.  But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just don't want to let go.  The plastic it's made out of doesn't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually.  Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim et al is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it's holding.  Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it. I previously gave it one star but now that it's acclimated and working I give it 4 only because of the cradle shortcoming or else it would have been a full 5.  I know it shows one star but Amazon wholdn't allow me to edit the scale.
0	I struggled with trying to get this thing to work with my Blackberry 8700g for some time.  I even selected and downloaded a driver that was listed for Blackberry devices on the product web site.  After a lot of frustration I finally got my Blackberry to pair with the keyboard but it would still not recognize it when I tried to get it to link to it.  I contacted iGo product support and they informed me that: Unfortunately we do not have a driver for that device currently.  So I ended up wasting a lot of time on this keyboard that is supposedly for Blackberry and other PDA/Handhelds.By the way the carton itself does not state that it works with Blackberry devices only with Smartphones.  A fairly obscure barcode sticker on the back does indicate in small letters that it also works for Blackberry.  In my case though back it goes which really is a shame because I like the quality of the item otherwise and I am sure I could have made good use of it.  In the mean time I guess I'll keep looking.Lastly I also agree with the other reviewer who vented about the stupid sticker they place on the unit.  It is glued to the keyboard and to the front surface and is quite a pain to remove.
2	I have the version designed and manufactured for Dell by Think Outside Inc.  It is the same as this product but the keys are black.  The keyboard works great.  The keyboard folds up flat and is about 4x6 and it is thin.  It folds out to a full size keyboard when opened the keyboard latches so it won't fold up when you are typing and the keys have a great feel.  Loading the software to my Axim x30 and configuring the keyboard went smoothly and although I am somewhat comfortable with technology  I am not a techie by any measure.  The bluetooth is great and there is no need to carry cables and wires and this option has worked well for me for the past two years.The only problem I have is with the stand.  The stand is made with very flimsy plastic; although the manual says that it is detachable I would recommend extreme caution. After two years of extremely careful treatment my stand broke.I don't know if Think Outside Inc. will sell me this plastic part (I plan to contact them) but Dell does not stock or sell this part even though it is detachable; it does not take a genius to see that this part will not wear well.  After being transferred to four departments and then told to call their parts store the fifth Dell customer service representative told me to either purchase a new keyboard for $99.00 or carry my cradle around.  This seems silly and wasteful.If you work from one location and can use your cradle to hold your Pocket PC this is not an issue.  But if like me you purchased this for travel and portability and do not take your cradle with you this is a problem.So this is a great product with the above exception.  As a consumer I hope that manufacturers begin to learn that when you purchase something like this you expect quality.  It should not only work well but hold up under normal use and parts should be made available and easy to find.-Feb. 21 2006Update:  I contacted Think Outside Inc. through their website.  They sent me two replacement stands free of charge.  The customer service department was nice and I got the stands within three business days.  Great customer service!-Feb. 24 2006Another Update:  I am still using the keyboard and it still works great and my replacement stand is holding up and I still have the extra they sent me.  I would purchase this again and I wish sellers like Dell knew to direct customers who experienced the problem I did to Think Outside for replacement parts.  They had excellent customer service unlike Dell (they wanted me to purchase another keyboard).-Sept. 15 2006
2	I have had an LG-700 for a few years and I love it.  But I get complaints from people about the microphone picking up extraneous noises when I am on the phone in a supermarket or working in the kitchen so when it started to wear out I tried this one.  Well....this does have pretty good sound BUT the rigid frame for the yoke is a problem for this guy with a 17.5 neck.  And the location of the on/off switch is annoying (on the back).  Plus whereas the LG-700 has 6 buttons this has 4 and the buttons are sorely missed for all of the needed functions of such a headset.  I often get the Equalization changed message when I am trying to get Siri to pop up...very annoying!  On the plus side it does seem to connect to my iPhone quickly and the signal seems pretty stable.All in all it is nice...but misses in a few ways.****************Update:  After 3 weeks I returned this to Amazon.  The fit was just too annoying.  Thank you Amazon for your great return policies!
2	I was hoping for a blue tooth that will connect to more than one phone. I already had the LG and was hoping the Motorola would do better but I was let down. It is a great buy if you are only using one cell phone.
0	Pro'sUnit has great range.Comfortable in the ears can wear it all day.Battery life is awesome.Mute function make this very useful for someone that spends a lot of time on the conference calls.Con'sLasted two months and now will not turn on anymore. Trying to get motorola to fix it but no help so far.Audio books may have issues. The headset will cut out during short pauses and makes you lose out on a few seconds of the story as it reconnects. Only certain books caused this behavior.If it did not quit on me I would certainly recommend it as a phone headset.
2	It's so so.  Not as comfortable as advertised and hugs your neck which i hate.  Has great sound but  is quite plain. I own an older LG model bigger for guys my size.... Has more control buttons for the different functions compared to the 2 buttons the Motorola has.The off/on button is in a bad place every time I lay on the bench to lift weights I lay on the button which shuts it off ...Poor design. I wouldn't say not to buy it but a gadget person as myself I prefer the LG so I returned the Motorola and ordered a newer LG model ..
2	I lost my 2-year-old LG Tone HBS-700 headset and someone else is doubtless enjoying it.The Motorola cables appeared to be more robust than the LG cables and the price point was attractive compared to the newest LG HBS-800 so I decided to take a chance.The good:- price- earbud fit- strong cables- battery life- reception- button function and placement- pairing- telephone functionThe bad:- looks goofy- the band is a tight fit- two-tone cable color may as well be illuminated with a sign that says look at me!The mediocre:- sound quality (richness and frequency response) simply cannot match the LG Tone HBS series- equalizer is not very effective (bright treble but non-existent bass)Summary:This product is inferior to the LG where it counts:  the sound.  For me that is sufficient reason to warrant return of this product and purchase of the newest and ridiculously expensive LG Tone HBS-800.  I am returning the Motorola this week but I will delay my purchase of the LG until the price becomes more reasonable.  In the meantime I'll get by with a wired pair of earbuds.
2	This bluetooth did not last me a year.  I called Motorola for a replacement.  They sent another model and I've been using it for four years now.
2	It worked good for a few months.  Gradually it began loosing its quality. People have trouble hearing now.  I am also getting static and cannot use very much.  Works a little better in my cell phone than Skype.  Overall I do not reccommend it.
2	When I first received this product it worked well.  After a month and a half it stopped communicating with my cell phone. I called Motorola and they told me it was guaranteed for a year and to send it back to them. The model I bought is no longer sold and they have a new one out now. They told me they will replace the blue tooth. It has been over 3 weeks since I mailed it in and I have yet to hear anything. I am happy with the blue tooth technology. But I am not happy with Motorola. They have never contacted me since I called them about the prolems I was having and have not even taken the time to e-mail be they received my old one (which I know they have by my shipping receipt I got back). My blue tooth may have been a lemon but Motorola's customer service is not up where it should be. I am still waiting for a replacement to come in. In the meantime I am using the free plug-in type I received when I bought my phone.  My advice is Buy a Bluetooth just be careful who makes it and check out their customer service.
0	It won't work with my phone. After 2 hours I got it to connect but it won't answer when I get calls or turn on when I want to make them. Plus there were obvious scuff marks on the device. It's made of cheap plastic and the charger has the old-fashioned two-prong adaptor. I'm going to start looking for a better device ... especially one that charges with the universal USB adaptor so I don't have to carry multiple cords with me.
2	It's a great deal so i jumped on it. But was truly disappointed. I've so far summed up Motorola products as well really really poor. I own a Razar wish i could return that! But this headset thinking it's from motorola would work well with my phone but no. It's on my belt clip and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away signal is weak and then disconnets. To me that's strange. It's also surprising that this happens randomly so it's kinda annoying b/c you can't anticipate it. Kinda annoying when driving b/c you rely on the headset to work properly. Also get the static noise which is weird b/c it shouldn't do that. especially when driving.
0	a couple problems with this headset when using it with the Treo 650 -1. it does not automatically connect when a call is received or initiated2. the volume is way too lowcheck out the Jabra JX10 Cardo Scala or Palm Treo headset ---- there are too many great headsets out there to settle for this onehappy shopping!
0	I am not impressed.I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking. This device does not cancel out background noise. Listeners on the other end say I sound like I'm in a tunnel. Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one's mouth and the pinhole for the internal microphone. There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise. This is a defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking. The ear attachment and its hinge is made of flimsy plastic. As a result the fit isn't tight enough. I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing's going to fly off my head into the back seat. It's an extremely annoying distraction that you don't want to have while driving.On the good side I don't have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use.
2	I've used a number of Bluetooth headsets and this is among the worst. The sound quality is low especially outdoors and there is quite a bit of static even when within a few feet of the phone. The volume is poor - even with the volume cranked up to the top I could barely hear the other party indoors and outside (with any background noise) it was almost impossible. This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear (earbud style). The microphone is far enough from one's mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable especially if you wear glasses but not as bad as some others I've tried. It does not flop around much under normal circumstances. I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500 which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I'm going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250. I've used those in the past and found them much better overall and worth the extra price.
0	I used have one of this earpeice 2 years ago and I lost it so I ordered this since this is much much cheaper than my previous one.Different from the previous peice this item came in with extremely cheap package and it's sound quality is worse than my previous one. My friends complained about the ECHO and noise sometimes so I suspect if this is actually a refurbed one. Sometimes the manufacturer sell such items for much less with simplized packaging.
2	This is my first BT headset. The main reasons I chose this one were low price small size/weight and having seen a couple of people use this at work.Pros:The size/weight is so small as to be unnoticeable. I find the headset very comfortable for extended periods of time. Price-wise it was the cheapest headset from a reputable brand when I bought it. Battery life is decent probably 3+ days although I tend to charge it about every two days. Great for driving or any time you want your hands free but can't use speakerphone.Cons:People whom I call have complained occasionally about the sound quality. Range is not great sometimes 10 ft causes annoying I am about to disconnect noise. Because there is only one main button that is used for everything it is very easy to accidentally activate voice dialing last-number redial etc. Initial pairing with the phone was not intuitive at all: who knew you had to keep the button pressed while trying to pair up? Finally the blinking blue light on you temple makes you look like a robot!Recommendation:This is an OK first/small/cheap BT headset. If you talk a lot on the phone look for something else. There must be headsets out there that provide better sound quality longer range and have more intuitive buttons and controls.
2	The voice reception with this headset was just ok. Sometimes people on the other side had trouble hearing me sometimes especially when driving. I also get a tingling sensation around my ear and a mild ache in the outer part of my ear everytime I use it. It may be something to do with  the design of the head set. Research has never proved any connection between using wireless or bluetooth and the impact on your nerves/brain and I have to believe them...It's weird though that I get always get a tingling achy sensation if I use a cell phone continuously for more than an hour but with the bluetooth I get the same sensation in about 20 minutes. So try as I might I cannot wear it for prolonged periods of time. After I used this headset for about 2 months it just died on me! I used to charge it once every week and never left it on the charger for long periods - only till the blue light went off to show it had finished charging. I did this as other reviewers had warned against over-charging. However now the headset just died...after 2 months. I called Motorola and they agreed to replace it. It takes about 10-14 days from the time you send it in to get a new one. I'm waiting for the replacement to come back. Who knows how long this one will last!
2	This headset is actually not a bad deal but it is not a great deal either.  The design of the unit does not lend itself to easy long-term usage.  It constantly falls off my ear and it is a power hog.  I once got about 2 hours of usage from this device and that remains the record for battery life (Oddly it takes about two hours to charge this battery from empty).  I am surprised that Motorola couldn't get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line (the volume doesn't go up very high).  It's one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great.  Though it can sometimes be a little slow to register calls as I have received complaints that it takes me too long to answer the phone.Overall I like the idea of bluetooth but I haven't found a great headset yet.  I would recommend that you keep shopping around and if you don't find anything else in the price range that you like buy this one but beware of the limitations.There is one other upside:  I once accidentally used the charger that came with my wife's Motorola V276 phone to charge my headset.  When I compared the two chargers they were identical.
2	and i'm fairly disappointed! i bought this little gem at a cingular kiosk in the mall for $80 and i am thinking it's going back before my 30 days are up! in summary considering bluetooth still has some improvements to make this is just NOT worth $80 period. even if this device worked flawlessly it might be worth about $30 at best.here are my gripes:* it says it has a range of about 30 feet. hmmm...not really. i am even using this headset with a motorola phone (V505)and i can get about 20 feet away from it at best before the audio quality goes south. not the biggest deal in the world. even when i am close to the phone however there can be some interferance (crackling) and distortion. usually mild though. it seems like my microwave interferes with it (when it's cooking)!* doesn't fit snugly on my ear. rather it kind of hangs there. it doesn't have any kind of mechanism for adjustment so here's hoping it fits your ear. using this headset while lying down is hard to do; the device doesn't seem to want to stay put.* drops the bluetooth connection every now and again even when i am at close range.the good:* looks cool! ;)* battery life seems to be pretty good.* small lightweighti am going to look into some other options. this simply was a waste of money.
2	Since there is no rubber to gasket your ear noisy environments can make it hard to hear. i.e. in you car.
2	The audio is very soft of this headset.  I have to use one hand to push it against my ear each time I want to use it.  Also it is always checking to make sure it is still connected to the phone so it beeps every 5 to 10 seconds.
2	I bought this from Amazon. I linked quickly and worked as advertised.  I found the various button modes difficult to keep track of and found it a real problem over time.My biggest complaint is that this device is too too quiet at maximum volume.  Obviously Motorola did not test their design in a car that had some road noise.  I found it only adequate in a quiet room.  I suspect it is the fact that the speaker is a long way from the ear canal.  I am wondering if an in ear type will be better in the long run.Save you money on this one if you plan to use it in a car.  It is fine if your sitting in quiet room.
0	This thing just doesn't work well with the Treo 6501. it doesn't automatically connect when a call comes or when a call is initiated2. the volume is way too lowthe comfort is good but for the price there are many BETTER headsets out there ----consider the Cardo Scala the Jabra JX10 and the Palm Treo headset - those are your best betshappy shopping!
2	Lasted 3 months lucky I have two(charge one while using the other) the units last only for about 2-3 hours of use hardly good for all day jobs.Like the fit though but These items need to last the day.
0	I am not impressed.I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking.  This device does not cancel out background noise.  Listeners on the other end say I sound like I'm in a tunnel.  Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one's mouth and the pinhole for the internal microphone.  There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise.  This is a design defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking.  The ear attachment and its hinge is made of flimsy loose plastic.  As a result the fit isn't tight enough.  I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing's going to fly off my head into the back seat.  It's an extremely annoying distraction that you don't want to have while driving.On the good side I don't have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use.
2	This headset seems to work fine but the audio quality is nothing to write home about to the person on the other end of the line you will sound soft and like you are talking on a speakerphone. They will also hear a lot of background noise. I am much happier with the Cardo Scala 500 Bluetooth headset. It has much better audio quality and even comes with more stuff for about the same price.And you may not really *need* a wireless bluetooth headset because you can just use a wired one or use your speakerphone. But I admit that it's sort of cool to be totally wireless-you can put the phone in your pocket or purse and be totally unencumbered by wires which feels a bit safer and freer especially while driving or when you have to work with both hands and talk at the same time for example.A note about the battery-do not store this unit (or your phone) in a hot car! Heat damages batteries and shortens their lifespan.
2	Problems I've got with this unit:1. Too short range; much shorter than stated 10m;2. Lost signal or lost connection with cellphone more frequently than I imagined;3. When I used this headset to call my friends and T-mobile customer reps they usually complained that they can barely heard my voice. Maybe the voice collected by the headset is too weak!
2	I bought this to connect walkman type gadgets to my car stereo.  It worked well at first but the wiring quickly started having problems.  The sound would cut out and I'd need to mess with the cable to find a position where the wires inside would be touching correctly again.  After 8 months the wire is now completely detached from one of the plug ends.  Maybe the heat of my car played a role in the breakdown of the cable but if that's how you're planning on use it don't be surprised if it starts shorting out on you too.
0	Don't purchase these if you plan to use in your car. The side walls are too thin and if this lays next to any 12 power source my Sirus Radio in my case you'll get the electrical whine as the cars rpm's increase and decrease. You get what you pay for.
0	Received it plugged it in didn't work. Tried jostling the cable and plug around couldn't get it to work. Can't recommend it.
0	Bought this as a line-in cable for my in-dash stereo from my cell phone. The cable does not work. I only get sound out of one side of the stereo when it's fully plugged in. In order to hear stereo i need to hold cable out to before the spring click. Unfortunately this doesn't suit my needs for the car.
2	If you have large hands ( like me ) you will find the keyboard difficult to use. I had particular difficulty with the 5-way directional button. No matter how carefully I used the button I ended up hitting the adjacent buttons too. I also had problems using the camera feature because of it's tiny size. However in the interest of full disclosure I am a bit of a klutz. I was also displeased to find that the unit's limited memory made any real web browsing impossible. Also there appears to be no Bluetooth compatibility with Macs. It will sync with the use of a data cable ( a separate purchase required ) but I think it's a shame to spend the extra bucks for Bluetooth only to find it is of limited use.What made me decide to return the phone was that I found the signal to be weaker than any other cell I have ever owned. We live in a little valley that compromises the signal of any cell phone but the A630 couldn't establish a solid connection.It's a great looking device and it feels very well built. The screen is small though it provides a very sharp image. I strongly expect that a more nimble fingered PC user might find the phone's many features to be tons of fun.
0	it's the worst cell phone I had to date.1 this phone has 1 to 2 second delay when buttons are pressed.2 because of slow button key I kept doing and unding key lock/unlock several times to actually call anyone.3. battery life is only about 48hrs (standby) and defintly not 200 some minutes as what this phone's spec says.4. phonebook is pretty messedup. phone book name displys only first half of first line although it allows you to enter two lines.5. on/off button some times takes second try.6. it's not straight forward to save work/home/mobile... under one name.7. phone charger connection is so flimsy that in certain position it won't charge. design is pretty messed up.8. 1/8 of color lcd screen is already dying only after 5 month of useage.9. signal is very poor. I'm sure this lot more to do with Tmobile.Basically slow and unintuitive phone.Bright side of all this is that Tmobile contact is only for one year.
2	I have placed these in several of my phones since they first came out in the 1990s. I know that they made a big difference in my older phones that had physical antennae&#8217;s which needed to be pulled out of the phone.  Since the phone antennae&#8217;s have changed I haven&#8217;t been able to notice any significant improvements with these installed or without them. I install them now because I got some for free and this is probably what they are now worth. The level of improved reception is about as noticeable as the loss of cash that I paid to get these free signal boosters.
2	This item does nothing to enhance the signal in your phone I followed the instructions and applied the antenna as stated but no change in the signal strength. I guess that's the reason why they're selling so cheap. Do not waste your time with this product.
0	Didn't work for my Galaxy S3 SPH-L710 so in case you have this same phone or just a Galaxy S3 (Verison AT&T T-Mobile) doesn't matter. It wont work.
0	This does not work at all. And once you put it on it is so hard to took off. Never again!!!!
0	I PUT THIS PRODUCT IN MY PHONE AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY SIGNAL STRENGTH AT ALL. I BOUGHT SOME BEFORE AND THEY ACTUALLY HELPED BUT THESE DID NOT.
0	these things are ajoke they do nothing for the phone but for the price it was a fun thing to try. but really not worth a dime
0	you do not get a 6 pack you only get 1 of them do not be fooled i was very upset that it only came with one and i do not liked to be tricked like that
2	We've had the Sidekick II for about two months.  Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn't have a normal keyboard so you must flip the screen up to press the keys then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation you have to keep flipping the screen up to press 1 for English etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet use Instant Messaging or even Download Fun.  Otherwise all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter A has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip for example.Internet browsing is cool but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display.Oh yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.  You can't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper it isn't really ready for prime time.
2	Sidekick II is meant to be your one-stop-shop wireless gadget for e-mailing web-browsing and IM chatting anywhere you go.  You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier esp. the new thumb keyboard but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service though is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data) it's even worse and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g. when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed so if you get the SK be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie you'll probably find T-Mobile's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK's true wireless Internet access appealing.
2	I regret buying this phone it's really big and verizon service isn't that great with this phone.  For some reason other verizon phones have like 3 bars when mine has 1 or will have 1 bar when i'm getting no service.  That said the phone does have a beautiful inner LCD the outer LCD is pretty bad.  You can play with the settings. It has loads of features like alarms and calanders and everything else you could think of.  The camera is terrible which is pretty much true with all cell phones though so that's a non unique gripe. The phone is also moderately fruity like when you make or recieve calls the outer LED will start blinking purple blue pink etc and it makes you look like a teenage girl and the menus are all kind of childish.  That said when the phone does have some bars calls never drop and it's pretty easy to set up the phone.  I'm not sure what other options there are out there for verizon cell phones i recently switched from tmobile but im sure you can do better than this phone good luck.
2	i like camera phones but i can't believe this phone don't have usb cable to upload pics..i have to pay $.25 for sending each pics..Viewing all camera phones this one is pretty nice..It's got flash and it's got 4 different types of resolutions..It zooms in more than i expected..Other than camera for contact list it gives you to save #s pic ringtones for a person..I think thats good..i guess that's all i'm gonna say..Overall phone is decent.For other viewers if you wanna buy this you should buy it now and don't wait cause more updated phones will come out soon
2	I get significant transmission static with this headset with my I-mate Sp3i unless I point the phone directly at the headset from a few feed away. It has static if I put the phone in my shirt pocket! Since I haven't done a baseline test of the phone with other bluetooth headsets I can't say if it is the headset or the phone but either way if you buy one of these and have the same problem make sure and return it within the return period.Another problem is the plastic ear holder (the part that holds the headset to your ear). This is a bad design and honestly there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear. The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so. Avoid this headset if you want wear a headset for extended periods of time.A final note: The wind blocking technology works well but at the expense of a high quality sound transmission to your recipent. I've asked a few of my techno-geek-friends when I'm talking to them with the headset and they all say that the sound quality seems to be missing a full dynamic range.Good luck!
0	the behind the ear thing just broke...I baby my stuff and treat it VERY lightly and this piece of junk just fell apart!!!Very dissapointed!!!I should have made my additions to this review long ago but Logitech cam through for me on this headset in a huge way! They immediately sent me a replacement of the headset but not just a replacement an $85 replacement! Then told me to keep the broken one which I was able to fix with some Krazy Glue!Really incredible customer support...I will never hesitate to buy something branded with the Logitech name!BTW 5 stars on the earpiece itself once it was repaired with the glue.
2	I'm a great believer in spending as little as possible on glitzbells and whistles and generally go for performance and practicality. Sound quality and features are fine for the price.  But the unit is quite difficult to wear -- the boom is wide and boxy; the weight is unbalanced as well.  I could not get a comfortable fit.  My ear is well within normal range of size and shape but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here.  If you don't care about medium to long term fit and comfort or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear you may be happy with this headset.  I wasn't and am returning it.  I'm going to give the Cardo Scala a try;  if it's no good I'll probably go with a Jabra and spend a bit more money.
0	The sound quality was excellent but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering poor mechanical engineering.I loved it when it wasn't broken.  Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech.
2	Pros:- Price- Ease of pairing- Sound quality (yours and theirs)- Battery lifeCons- Painful for an extended time (10 mins)- Hard to tell if on or off
2	There isn't much to say here.  For the phone system I have this was needed to enable the remote functions of the  Plantronics-CS540 Convertible Wireless Headset.  It could be more aesthetically-pleasing but as I'm sure it's designed for a wide variety of phones that need a remote lifter I suppose you can't complain.Mounting the unit can be tricky.  You need to be certain it will work properly before you use the sticky tape to mount it in place.  So you wind up holding it with one hand while working your headset to activate/deactivate it several times to be sure you've found the right spot for it.Comes with a special headset adapter for phones with shapes that offset the lifter bar.
2	This device takes a signal from a wireless headset like the CS540 and lifts up the receiver from your base phone unit. Depending on your phone's angle and the conformation of the receiver it may work or not. My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit and if it's angled correctly. That's because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I'm going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody's business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent. But the next one lasted 2 minutes (an M22) which only lasted that long because I tap danced on it before I threw it in the trash. The latest is a CS540 which I will review once I have one that doesn't arrive DOA. That's right dead out of the box. I got it overnight shipped only to diagnose a bad cable from receiver to amplifier (which will take a week to get replaced.) Nice! Overnight emergency turns into a tech job for me plus a week's wait. I put all this stuff in the review because I'm not sure Plantronics deserves their top spot in telephone headset and accessories. We're pretty much stuck using them and I see the quality going down over the years. This lifter is case in point; it's not the swiftest design imaginable. The little extender rod/gripper that is your last-ditch method to get your receiver to hang up is a kludge in my opinion. Perhaps you've had better results but I find this thing less than perfect.
0	It says it's compatible with all Motorola handsets...  It doesn't work at all with Motorola/Giant Talkabout FRS/GMRS/CB 2-way radios having 2.5mm jacks.  Very disappointing.
2	Set it up it worked great for a little over 24 hours and the base unit failed to connect to my laptop. Returned and purchased a different item. Didn't want to take the business risk of replacing with the same thing.  Can't afford to be offline for as long as it will take to get this replaced.To be fair I have used several Plantronics headsets and they were all great... my all time favorite is now 10+ years old and not compatible with Google Voice (though it does work great with Cisco IP phone). I also have a bluetooth Plantronics Voyager headset for my iPhone and it is also very good.
0	I have had this phone almost 6 weeks (40 days).  At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working (a s d f and g etc).  I was told to call Palm in India which I did and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up because I have really loved Palm.  This is my fourth Palm device though it will likely be my last.  I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation.  My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone my Palm T3 and my laptop).  And then that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course when I took the phone to Sprint they said it was Palm's responsibility to repair.  When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes as they always do.  Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink that they said they would give me - this one time - a free return and repair meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days. They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $25 to get a refurbished replacement complete with a 90-day warranty (which I now know means nothing).  These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just don't work and that I needed something immediately.  I don't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people or how I can be made to feel like they're doing me a favor by standing behind their product.  I am the customer!  Doesn't that mean anything anymore?I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad (though Amazon's remains very very good).  When a person spends $400 on a phone or any device it should work longer than a few weeks.  But when it does stop working the company that sold it should stand behind their product instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility.  Subsequent to this occurrence other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s as well.There are other issues with this phone.  Out of the box the power/sync cord did not work.  I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced.  (I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle which works fine.) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume.  Every so often the phone just resets itself - can't figure this one out at all.  Also when someone calls in on Call-Waiting you cannot disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call; in other words when you accept the Call-Waiting call it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously even when the first party hangs up.  This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also there are limited non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone.  And don't get this phone for its camera: cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise all the Palm applications work as they should and as they have for the past number of years.  Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device.  My company will stop using Palm and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint (when contracts start to expire).My apologies for the rant but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers.  Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore?  I know mine tries to; otherwise we're out of business.
2	I purchased the Scala 500 as my first BT headset and I regret it. The company is v-e-r-y slow to respond to email messages to their support box so call them don't write.While the sound quality of the unit is very very good there are other issues with the unit. First the fit on my particular ear is horrible... always feeling like it was going to fall off. I never trusted it walking through airports as it just didn't feel secure.Second the unit literally fell apart in my hands after three or four months. The portion that protrudes gently into my ear came loose then broke off. I note that others have metioned the same thing. It just wasn't well constructed. Bummer! I've replaced it now with another low-cost unit made by Plantronics but while I miss the sound quality of the Cardo I am disappointed by their slow support and poor quality.
2	Let me say up front that I ordered this from Amazon after reading all the glowing reviews and I've been fairly disappointed by the performance I've experienced.  My experience was specific to using the Scala with Sprint's LG-PM325.First the audio quality was not good.  If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception.  Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio.  When using the headset with my phone while the phone was in my front pocket the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable.  And it's not by hearing.Second there's the shiny blue light.  When I read other's comments about the flashing blue LED I really didn't think much of it.  But in the dark this thing is a strobe light.  At night with my headset left on some countertop downstairs and while I was upstairs I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling.  That's part A.  Part B the flash results in a very slight audible clicking not unlike when a camera flash goes off.  Which means if you use this thing at night while lying in silence be prepared for a constant audible and visible reminder that you're wearing the Scala.Battery life was good.  Pairing was excellent.  The piece stayed on my head pretty well and comfortably and making or answering calls was straightforward.I've returned mine because of the two problems.
2	This is my first bluetooth device. Read reviews and considered other headsets costing $50 and $100. Based on reviews and value got this one. Have used it three days.It works well and came with a good set of accessories. My only complaint really is that the tone of voices on my end sounds a bit like a tin can phone. Intelligibility is not a problem but the sound is a bit disconcerting. Most people I talk to say it sounds fine on the other end but one complained of the tunnel sound.But it is a good value. It synched with my T-Mobile Wing right away. I think it dropped a couple of calls but cannot be certain where the blame lies. I just walked away from the phone and when I came back it reconnected immediately.Other comments: The eyeglasses clip is a great idea but I'll have to modify it to work with my thin wire frames. The ear clip is fine. The supplied neck cord is a good idea but I'm not using it. The belt clip seems a bit vulnerable as it sticks out pretty far.Mine was missing the full manual (a return?) but the online PDF was easy to find.Overall I did expect slightly better performance but am satisfied with the value and general function of this headset.
0	I specifically ordered this headset because of the eye glass clip.  When I received the order the clip would not fit on my glasses and appeared to be of extreme poor contstruction (the type you would expect out of a Craker Jack box).The headset would required pressing the button to answer a call several times before it would actually pick up the call.The product is in the process of being returned to Amazon.com.
2	Let me begin this review by stating that a lot of people have used this device quite successfully.  As for me there were two main problems.  First I found the sound level to be too low.  While it's easy enough to turn up the volume the problem lies in the microphone being so close that it causes a major echo for the person on the other end.  The second problem I had was that I was never able to transfer a call from the device to the phone.  I tried to use this model for a couple weeks just to make sure but after that time I decided to send it back and keep looking.
2	Compared to Motorola Bluetooth headsets this Cardo really rocks. It has much better mic and speaker sound quality and volume than Motorola. The Motorola makes me sound like I'm talking on a speakerphone while the Cardo is a bit better in this regard.That said because the mic is so far away from your mouth you will still sound very distant and a bit muffled. With this Cardo callers still complain when I'm in the car or outside on a windy day that there is a lot of background wind noise.I ended up going back to the wired headset that came with my Motorola RAZR phone which has much better audio quality and is not as cumbersome to setup during a call as a Bluetooth headset.
2	I am using this device with a Polycom landline phone.Trying the 3 settings I can get a decent connection on my end with a separate Bluetooth earpiece where I hear the other party fine with little noise and no echo.But on the far end even landline to landline there is an annoying whine and some echo no matter what the setting.  This isn't good enough I prefer to use the corded headset.I am returning this product to Amazon.
0	I bought exchanged and then returned this unit.  Both units delivered to me would not turn on.  When I charged them using the supplied adaptor the red charging light came on and a few hours later the unit was supposedly fully charged.  However when I attempted to turn the unit on by pressing the power button nothing happened.  The unit never came on could not be paired and never worked.  I returned both of them.  I can understand one unit being bad but two units that were shipped several weeks apart shouldn't be.When I called for technical support I waited on hold for sometime and then gave up.
0	I bought this item @ a local retailer was happy cause i got it on sale (probobly clearance) well it worked 2 days then the wire going into the unit it self would get static if touched!  I can not find my receipt so i e-mailed jabra & they are acting like this isn't an issue! wanting to know how many phones i tried if i tried more than 1 headset etc.... i will prolly get no where or if they do accept a return the S&H Charges will be stupid & not worth replacement!  Just get a nice wired headset less $ spent & less headache!
2	Ok. I just bought this adapter today for my PDA cellphone.  The product integrates well with everything (My Laptop - sony vaio cellphone (siemens sx56 my panasonic cordless home phone (although with the panasonic ppl complain about my voice being faint)).  But the issue is  I hear static crackling noises even if I'm not in a call. As soon as my bluetooth headset is connected to the a210 adapter it produces faint-medium crackling noise. The noise is exactly like the one it produces when you move out of range.  But happens even at 1-2 feet distance.  I was initially confused on what is producing this.  The battery was fully charged on the adapter.  The bluetooth headset is not the issue as it connects well with my laptop (which has integrated bluetooth).  Then I figured if I keep the adapter and phone closer (few inches away from my ear) to my headset then everything works well. Otherwise even at a distance of 2-3 feet  it starts the crackling.  I even switched modes (123) on the adapter and still the same issue.  Although it works upto 20-25 feet the crackling starts at a distance of 2 feet.  I even turned off my wireless networks to test this.  Also exchanged it for a new one to see if it was a item specific issue.  But even the 2nd one is having the same problem.  The manual says that it is due to interference.  I think many 2.4 Ghz can cause this inteference.  Alhtough I turned off all of my wireles devices it still caused the issue even in my car (slightly better but not totally gone).But in any case if you don't hear the crackling it integrates very well with everything.  The crackling is heard only by you not by the person on the other side.  So we can probably live with it.  There are not many bluetooth adapters that are available out there.Note: Many reviewers here complain about this adpater not working well with home phones.  First of all if you read the manual this is not designed to work with home phones (if it works well with home phones then you're lucky).  It is designed to work primarily for mobile phones only.
2	I could NOT get it charge. Did not sent it back because it would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it. I ask for help on this and got no where. But I did order Nokia BL-5C and it works great.
0	It was because I could no longer obtain good quality BL-5C's that I finally gave up my Nokia phone.I think the last battery I tried in it was one of these it actually had worse performance than the battery I had used for a year and was trying to replace.These might be phonies from China or just so old that they are chemically inert but I am afraid I can't recommend these.
0	Got this is a timely mannor put it in my phone chatged for 12+ hours and nothing ! Never worked ! Annoyed to say the least ! I ordered this just in time to go into the hospital for a ce section so i wouldnt have to charge my phone all that often considering bending and such will be painfull. A lot of good it did me.
2	I purchased this battery for a premium as it boldly proclaimed &#34;Li-Ion&#34;.  That purchase was before I noted that all of the other more inexpensive batteries were also Li-Ion types and also OEM.  My fault for not paying attention.  Be advised there are better prices for this exact item on Amazon so please keep looking.This having been said the item was shipped quickly and arrived so fast that I almost had to duck.  I therefore have no issues with the seller who is doing a good job.
2	Overall an OK headset that versus the H700 trades better inbound voice quality for less outbound quality. Given its low price though it's a great value though I can see why some RAZR and PEBL boxes include this for *free*. My report card:Design: A- nice simple design. Buttons are few and easy to use though the main button is a bit sensitive. Single-tap to power-on  is a welcome feature. USB charging a real plus.Aesthetics: A- it's attractive in its minimalist aesthetic. Color options are cool. (And there more of then if you shop elsewhere!)Build quality: A it's a solid unit with good materials.Comfort: B+ it's lightweight with a decent ear clip. Unfortunately the earclip is loose on the headset which combined with the light weight make for a very floppy fit.Compatibility: A no problems pairing. Connects quickly when turned on. Headset has full handsfree functionality that is very easy to use.Outbound sound quality: B callers can hear me fairly well but many have complained of a pronounced speakerphone effect requiring some self-repeating. OK noise cancellation.Inbound sound quality: B+ volume is more than adequate but could be a tad bit louder still for noisy environments. Incoming voices are clear but could use some bass. Minimal static.PS: A previous reviewer believed that like the HS850 with its folding mic boom (the on/off and connection switch) you need only turn on the H500 when receiving a call; the headset would connect quickly with the phone and pick up the call. THIS IS FALSE. You must leave the H500 turned on and actively connected to your phone in order to use it just like any other headset.
0	I bought this Bluetooth as a back-up for my pretty pink Motorola H500. Therefore I placed it in the drawer until I needed a replacement and last night i needed it. I plugged it up for a couple of hours and tried to pair it to my new phone and it did not work. I then charged it overnight and again tried to pair it and nothing (not one indicator light). I plugged the blue-tooth back into to the charger it had a steady blue light and i tried pairing it to my phone while it was on the charger and it worked; unfortunately i can not walk around with a charger and outlet attached to my head. Consequently this was a lemon and due to the months passed from my internet purchase i am unable to return it or exchange.Therefore the moral of the story is to test everything you purchase from the internet. I learned a valuable lesson.
0	The device was not as the description. It looked as if someone dropped it off their vehicle and it hit the road and skidded all the way down. I was VERY disappointed when opening it b/c it was the first thing I seen other than the front damage.I did email the seller and told them and they were very nice and refunded me as I returned the product back to them.
0	was very unhappy with this it didnt work no time i had got it for my husband and i haven heard the last of it from him
2	This probably isn't being sold any more but I really enjoyed my time with it.  It lasted me three years!  Compared to the new ones out this is bulky and sound quality isn't as good.  But the fact that it remained in tact in working condition especially with a rechargeable battery is remarkable.
2	This bluetooth is basically ok but the part holding on to your ear is very 'flimsey' and tends to want to fall off if u bend over so u have to keep securing it on your ear which is quite annoying as I almost lost it a few times not realizing it was no longer on my ear...so it's a huge drawback for me. It seems to work ok otherwise tho sometimes I do have a  sound problem that is not present when I just listen straight from the phone without it...it's sometimes quite garbled. So this product for me though cute is average in fuction.
2	The price of bluetooth devices has gone down dramatically that I was able to justify buying one:)  The H500 works fine with our LG Shine.  Although you may need to talk a little louder so that the other person can clearly understand you (Well not too bad really).It was an easy setup.  The device itself looks fine not too dorky in my opinion. It also has a nice blue LED light. Available in many colors of choice.Why not 3 stars?  The volume control is hardly palpable.  It is hard to adjust the volume while in use.  Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust.  Even the call button is difficult to press.I like the ear hook can be flipped to be used either on your left or right ear.  It is also not too heavy to be worn comfortable on your ear.
2	This Bluetooth sucks. Plain and simple... I mean I paid what $15 for the thing so wasn't expecting the best but at least working quality. I always buy the Motorola H730 or H750 which are upwards of $60 but I always lose them. Always! It is a curse so I figured I would get a rinky-dink cheap one so I wouldn't cry in the corner losing out on a day&#8217;s worth of work pissed and distraught over losing my (what is this my 6th) Bluetooth. But with every call - EVERY ONE - it was unbearable static on my end so much so that everyone mentioned it. Hell even the recorded lady on the voicemail was like this thing sucks! So yeah just spend the extra cash and go up a few grades because this was a lost cause.
2	The phone is ok. I didn't find any difference between RAZR and the Motorolla V300 I had earlier. All the features are the same.Razr has a big huge color screen bluetooth enabled and can capture videos. But there is no improvement on any of the calling features.So if you are getting the phone free after the rebates you can buy it else it is not worth the $200.
2	I'll start with the bad first given the amount of interest this phone has generated.1) The Phonebook application is a little...wonky. Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact which is NOT true. You can but its nearly hidden underneath the MORE function while editing the contact. However its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle.1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list.2) Even at full blast the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus the audio sweet spot on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone.3) Compared to a Samsung V205 a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330 the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower.4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says Sorry we don't offer games for your phone yet. My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it but its still a feature something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV.5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again.7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work but not without some work.Alright so now for the good.1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone this one has it in spades.2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left.3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid.4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree.6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space.7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?8) Ringtones can get quite loud even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud.This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily I'd be bringing the phone back like tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it.Hopefully Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.
2	The #1 reason to buy (and keep) this phone is the slim form factor.  Let's face it - for guys who don't like to keep the phone on their belt like a pager a pants or suit pocket is the only option.  This phone is far and away the best one in that regard.  I forget it's there a lot of the time.  It is also built EXTREMELY solidly and does NOT scratch easily although the SCREEN scratches easily.However the battery life is terrible.  I literally have to charge it every night after less than two hours of talking with bluetooth.  You MUST get the car charger immediately.  Even though I had bought one on the internet I couldn't wait for it because the phone kept dying so I raced to a local cingular store for an intermediate car cord.The Motorola HS-850 BT headset is great but occassionally loses connection w/the phone which is frustrating.The only reason I kept this phone is the size.
2	Bought this phone(Actually the black v3 but the only real difference is video support and additional memory) for $149 from BB replacing my v551 basically just for the chic factor. Initally I was very happy and excited with my purchase but after a couple of weeks the novelty wore off and its shortcomings became apparent. The biggest issue I have is being able to hear through the earpiece. Unless you ear is EXACTLY on a random sweet spot' good luck hearing in anyhintg but the quietest environments. I even removed the little M circle with little or no help. The second shortcoming is the the screen. While it has more colors available than the v551 the resolution does NOT look nearly as good. And if you are viewing blacks and not looking directly at it you get a wierd grey-black thing going on with one eye. Kind of hard to explain except for those of you with the phone. Much to my dismay the screen is actually WORSE than the one on the v551. The third is the camera. I rarely use a phone cam but the times I needed it the pictures looked well...horrible. And last but not least the reception. The reception is not as good as everyone makes it out to be. The v551 actually had better reception. My new LG CE500 actually has MUCH better reception and is generally a much better phone. This phone is a GOOD phone. Nothing more nothing less.
2	I origanally purchased this phone thinking it had voice dialing similar to the motorola v710. Unfortunately is uses the old style of voice dial where you have to train your voice for each phonebook entry. The v710 does not require this and utilizes true speech recognition software. Since this was the most important feature to me I am returning the razr and exchanging it for the v710. To bad the razr is superior in most other categories except the one most importand to me. If it had true nex technology voice recogition I would keep it.
0	Bought this phone with Cingular service. I needed the phone in a hurry. I checked my order next day had this weird message:Order RevisionOrder placed October 08 2005 at 10:35 PM PDTOpen order -- your order revision requiredhas not approved you for any phone and service plan packages. Please cancel necessary phone and service plan packages from your order. We cannot proceed with your order without some action on your part. Please be aware that if you do not take action on this item within 5 DAYS it will be cancelled from your order.Cancel necessary phone and service plan packagesI had no idea what this cryptic message meant but essentially they were requiring me to cancel the order. I have three cell phones in my family perfect credit no earthly reason why I wouldn't be approved for a cell phone account just the above message with no explanation. Of course there is no one at Amazon to call for an explanation. I don't know if my form was missing some information or something was mistyped - no idea at all what happened. I think that if Amazon was going to cancel my order they need to explain it to me.I have bought from Amazon before usually good service but this is just awful.I think that Amazon is in over their heads in the cell phone business.From other comments it sounds like Amazon is not being fully honest or transparent in their cell phone ads.
0	My wife and I each purchased V551s with our migration to Cingular 6 months ago. In that time (during which the phone was never dropped bumped etc) I've replaced my phone twice and hers once. The problems we've had include:- random white screen of death- Bluetooth connectivity problems (isolated to phones)- dropped calls in perfect reception areas- random battery indications- the infamous Unable to Charge problemAdd to that Motorola's lousy phonebook and UI and retarded Bluetooth handling (e.g. if any BT device is connected the same Moto default ring sounds regardless of sound profile or caller-specific ringtones) and you have an overpriced overhyped oversize paperweight.I'm fortunate Cingular offers my company's employees discounts on new phones so that I can go back to Sony Ericsson. My old T616 gave me 2 years of perfect service even after having been dropped twice. It's on its 2nd owner now who has used it for 6 months problem-free.
2	My chief complaint with this phone is that the Ringtone selector is accessible from the outside of the phone which causes it to be changed when simply handling it or fiddling with it in your pocket. There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure. This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before. I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling. I have gotten more drops on this phone than any other but i have never used cingular before so i don't know whether its the service or phone. Overall i want to like the phone but i'm searching for something else as the frustrations arent worth it.
0	Doesn't stay on even if you figure out how to get it on. The ear plug piece is big and bulky and then you can't hear. The mouth piece is way too short so no one can hear you talk over the car and road noise.  The cord is too short and there is not volume control on the cord with is inconvenient. Get the Bluetooth and give up the wire.
0	This fell apart after one use and the person I called couldn't even hear me when it wasn't broken to pieces.  VERY disappointed! :(
0	This model the C150 is one of 4 Jabra headsets I have ordered. I continued to try different Jabra models because the ear piece is by far the most comfortable and best sound quality I have ever used however all 4 Jabras had very poor microphone quality. With each one the persons on the other end could not hear me. Disappointed. I found that it worked well with a cell phone but not with a cordless phone.
0	I screwed up; shouldn't have ordered this; it's of no use to me.  Since the real price was hidden in the shipping and handling it's pointless to return it; I'll just write it off as an educational expense.I actually bought this to use on a cordless handset that had a hands free 2.5mm jack. (Siemens cordless phone system).  The owners manual says ...any 2.5 mm headset so that's what I bought.  I don't even know where this thing is anymore; I put it back in the little bag and forgot about it.I tried it on three of the handsets in the system; the plug simply captures the line and makes a loud screeching sound...  ...playing with the plug I can find one tenuous position about a quarter of the way out where I can hear audio from the phone but the moment I let it slip it goes back to the screeching.I can't get it to work on anything else either including my wife's Samsung Intensity (which also has a 2.5mm headset jack; same results) but I don't have access to a PalmEvery so often I do something stupid; buying this was one of those occasions.
0	These did not work since the day I got them.The right earbud never had sound.I got a replacement and it's the same situation.I am not sure if it's because I'm using a Nokia E71x but they both don't work properly.
0	There's a problem with the design of this headset. The jack used is too short. It's EXTREMELY sensitive to movement. If you don't have it plugged in ALL THE WAY and keep it still you'll loose the connection. I don't know why they designed it that way...
2	I doesn't hold a charge for very long which is to be expected for an inexpensive battery.  You really do get what you pay for don't you?
0	This is the 3rd OEM battery I bought via Amazon Marketplace -- as with the others it was terrible. I ordered form the OEM shop a BR50. They sent a BR56 which is supposed to be even better with 3 hours talk time. It did not last 30 minutes after a complete overnight charge. Nowhere as long as the battery I am trying to replace which lasts over an hour instead of the original 2 1/2 hours.OEM sent a counterfeit fake battery --- not OEM. How can you tell? Because Motorola OEM batteries are made in Japan. These say clearly that they are made in china. I had the same problem and returned the same battery from Wireless Phone Accessories and Batteries4Less.AMAZON_- you should be screening these sellers and addressing these issues. There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.Theses companies make their money by selling junk counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it. For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time. My time is worth more than th $10 I get ripped off for. But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers. AMAZON's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth. Well AMAZON you can start here: Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders Wireless Phone Accessories and now the OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.I paid $30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit. So it has nothing to do with the price paid. Just dishonest online sellers.
2	They are probably old batteries sitting on a shelf by the time we got them. Not much better than the old ones I was replacing.
2	I purchased three of these batteries and each one would not last through one day in standby (not making calls) before it went dead.  I thought I had a problem with my RAZR V3M so I took it in and was informed that these batteries do not have enough milliamps required for the RAZR.  They replaced it with the correct battery and I have been using that one now for over a year with no problem.
0	I agree with other reviews... people who talk to me hear a horrible echo due to the mic picking up the earspeakers sound... even if I set the earspeaker to the lowest volume.  I'm glad it came free with my phone because if I'd payed for this... I'd be pretty mad.
2	This is my second bluetooth headset so I am able to compare this with my previous one (a Plantronics M2500).  Overall it is not a bad headset but it does have some flaws.*** Plus points include:***- uses a single AAA battery so there is no need to lug around a charger when traveling.  This alone is reason enough to make many people consider this headset over others.- Great battery life.  I don't understand the user that complained of only getting 1 hour of standby time.  Normally I get about 5-7 days standby with 4-5 hours talk time on a AAA rechargeable that is already somewhat depleted.  A fully charged AAA or a AAA alkaline should do far better!- fits snugly on the ear and is relatively low profile...although some users are right in that occasionally it feels like it might fall off the ear even though it is snug.- Great price from Motorola dot com.  I got this for $23 bucks with a leather pocket clip (including shipping).- No internal battery so you won't have to throw it away when the battery dies (the plantronics has a non replaceable internal rechargeable so when the battery dies in 1-2 years you will have to buy another headset).*** Negative Points Include: ***- The side multifunction button is too easy to press accidentally so occasionally I end up redialing the last call.- The plastic is a little too lightweight so if you drop it it will get scratched.- Switching ears is not as straightforward as it was with the Plantronics headset.  You have to remove the earpiece clip and then reprogram the volume buttons.  It doesn't take long but it is still a hassle compared to the Plantronics which only requires you to rotate the rubber ear insert.- The volume is definately not as high as the plantronics headset but it should be adequate for most people in most situations.- The light does not give you any clue as to the status of its battery.  The Plantronics will start flashing a red light when the battery gets weak whereas the motorola just starts beeping.  Great if you have it on your ear but not so good if you have it sitting on your desk or in the leather pocket clip.- The motorola does seem to have a lower range than the plantronics. I am not sure if that has to do with the battery not  being fully charged but I was able to use the Plantronics downstairs while my phone was upstairs whereas the Motorola will lose the connection as soon as I get to the base of the stairs.Overall the Motoroal HS805 is a great headset for first time bluetooth users or for anyone who travels a lot or talks a lot and does not want to lug around a power adapter but if you want a lot of the latest features then you should look elsewhere.
0	Summary: Stay away this product sports a very poor design...Pro:+ very low price+ very small and lightweight+ relatively easy to use+ pair up well with all my BT phonesCon:- morse-code like feedback signal - they try to accomplish too many tasks with single beep/tone.  1 short beep 2 short beeps 3 short beeps 1 long beep 3 beeps up 3 beeps down.  like another reviewer said  you really have to read the manual or keep it nearyby to be able to understand what all the beeping means.- echos no matter what volume you set it partly because this thing is very loud- insanely difficult to open the battery door.  I got so frustrated I was about to throw this thing out of the window.  For a product that use regular batteries the battery door is the most difficult to open.  Once opened you need a pair of tweazers to pull the battery out.  The battery compartment is very deep and extremely snug.  This must be a sick joke by Motorola.  Forget about changing the battery on the go you need to sit down and have a few tools and a lot of patience.  (for the record: this was my breaking point i had to return this unit because installing the battery for the first time was enough of a turn-off)- sound quality is mediocre at best
2	I bought a different BoxWave Patent Leather Clutch with magnetic closure and was so impressed by it's functionality. BoxWave changed the style to a snap closure and I didn't realize it until I received it.I'm not taking stars away because of my mistake but by the usual problem I have with snap closures. I have to spend extra time trying to snap it together because it doesn't just close on its own like with a magnet.The case also had marks inside under two of the stitches and shows mark on the patent leather as soon as I run anything slightly against it. I used this case once maybe twice had to return to the magnetic BoxWave leather clutch instead.
2	It's shiny which is pretty but that makes it a fingerprint magnet. Its just okay. I buy a lot of cases for my phones because I like to switch them out a lot. This one is nice for the times when you want a dressier case. For everyday I think I will stick with real leather cases from Zenus. They cost a lot more but they they wear well too IF you buy their real leather cases. The case cover creases if you accidentally run your fingernail along it. It's permanent crease. Its bulky so it protects but makes the phone too big. I used to love BoxWave but this one is a little disappointing.  Why buy a cheap case for your $650 phone.
2	Quality and value of this item are fine but WHOA it smells SO BAD!! Just like bug spray! I returned it promptly.
2	The product was OK however the material is somehow cheap looking leather. I am expecting something with more natural feel on it and not the one with shining look.
0	I tried putting my Galaxy S4 in the case and it kept popping out. It seems like the plastic casing is too small for the phone. Very disappointed.
2	I LIKED THE CASE VERY MUCH = BUT I NO LONGER HAVE THE PHONE = SO THE NEW BUYER THAT BOUGHT IT FROM ME AND THE CASE.
2	Its cheap the wristlet is like a little thread and not sturdy at all. You have to clip your uncased phone into the plastic backing attached 5o the purse. Money part needs length to really pack some cash in. Id like a better cash compartment which is one thing I wanted in my purchase.  Id say purchase a cheaper product like this. Id the wristlet breaks and im positive it will your product is pointless.  Buyer be aware. Update. I stopped using this. The same day I got this my phone was kind of stuck in it and without thinking I was madly pulling at it. Needless to say my note 2 went flying and cracked the screen to pieces. Just be careful handling your phone since this privides no protection and can be tough to disengage from the phone.
2	i like style wrist band good close clip but once put credit cards in its hard to close. phone stays in ok but if dropped phone will pop out.
2	It's patent so very easy to scratch. However the case is cute. Seems to fit but phone has slid out on multiple occasions out of case.
2	Looks and feels like plastic. Like the snap instead of a magnet. Looks better in the picture than in person. Holding up great after a couple of weeks. .
2	I bought this for my daughter to use on her vacation cruise. The magnetic clasp erased her room card and credit card. Kind of defeats the purpose of the clutch. It might be ok if you just used your drivers license phone and cash but people don't really carry cash and to have to have a credit or bank card reissued is problematic.
2	Adds too much bulk to my phone hence I purchased a different case.  Also unlike the pictures on the site the buttons on your phone will be covered.  The areas on the case where the power button and volume rocker are located are covered by plastic.  Not good in my opinion.  Makes it harder to press those buttons.  Might be preferred by those looking for a good amount of protection for their phone.
0	i returned it because it came dented.  I like it  wish i could have used it.  They said i got the last one.
2	I got the product very fast and it looks and feels great one the phone. However it did interfere with my cellular signal and brought my bars down from 3 to 1 and sometimes none. I started dropping calls and the people on the other line said I was fading in and out when I was able to talk to someone. I took the cover off my Note 2 and my bars popped back up to 3 and I had no problems with phone calls anymore. I tried it again to make sure it was the cover and sure enough it did the same thing as before. I had my partner try it as he has the same kind of phone and it did the same thing to his Note 2. So I had to return the case for a refund. It is disappointing because it was a great looking case.
2	This is a regular case fit I believe it's not pretty at all but neither bulky and the protection it's intermediate .
2	Not a very well made case thought it would be of better quaility hard to tell from just looking at it on the site.
2	I searched online for a case for my new Samsung Galaxy Note II and decided on this product with it's cool design. It has provided sufficient protection and I especially like the grip-ability on the sides.
2	I always buy BoxWave cases for my phones because they are well made practical comfortable and good looking. This time I am disappointed the cuts for camera with flash S-pen speaker and microphones are too big and it looks ugly. Plus because the S-pen is in the corner of the phone and the cut for it really big it doesn't provide good protection at this corner. What if the phone falls on this corner?
2	Great design and protected my phone really well from droppings. My one year old dropped it all the time and no problem. But the big problem is that it's stained. I don't know why I only put my phone in my purse not my jeans pockets but it got all blue-ish note
0	This product was pretty inexpensive so I had no expectations. When I received it I quickly noticed how flimsy the plastic was. You can probably fit 2 credit cards top. Might be a good case for nights out but probably wont protect your phone much. I ended up tossing it because it was too flimsy.
0	The case took almost a week to arrive. You buy a cheap case you're going to get cheap case quality. Stay away. The inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all. Will scratch your phone. Looks as if someone dropped it in dirt. Could not clean whatever gunk was on the case. Thank God it didn't scratch the aluminium on the case. A credit card didn't even slide all the way down into the case. Good luck trying to fit two in there. Spend your money else where.
0	The phone does not fit into this junky case properly.  Completely worthless and just a money grab by the seller.  It was cheap with the coupon code because it doesn't fit!  I tossed this case is in the trash where it belongs.  I realize purchasing a cheap case is a gamble but I never expected it be so bad that it doesn't even fit the phone. Completely useless.
0	its a worst product I have ever seen by motorola. It charges my phone but I have to hold the jack that goes into phone and also have to drive at same time.I bought Belkin's similar product from Walmart for $10 and it rocks.
0	I bought one of these and the second time I plugged it in the light on the end went out and it stopped working! This thing is junk there is no way to replace the fuse (if there is one) without destroying it. I tried to take it apart but you can't without breaking it. If this is a genuine motorola product its a stupid design. Now do I break it open and hope I can get it back together or toss it??? I have NEVER had a problem with a car charger in the 10+ years I have owned a cell phone that should tell you something! How do you screw one up?! You hire the idiot who designed this one thats how!
2	This is the 8th headset I have tried. Most of the ones I have purchased work very well with a cell phone but not so good on a cordless phone. Same with this set... Very comfortable to wear. I can hear those I call really well. Those that I call need to be able to hear me too! The volume on this mic is better than most I have tried but is still low. If you are talking to clients on the phone all day this is important. I have a good Panasonic cordless phone and have yet to find a headset to use with it that has a strong volume. Still looking.
0	OMG this has got to be the smallest piece of junk I have ever paid for :) really this charger died 2 weeks after I pluged it into my car.the charger itself is made of cheap plasticlight weight and just down right worthless. the 2 weeks I had it pluged init never gave my phone a full chargei drove 63 miles with it pluged into my phone and yet still did not fully charge it.guess you get what you pay for.so if you want morethen you'll have to pay more.
0	I like how it just barely sticks out from the cigarette plug on my Passat so I can close the cover when I don't have my phone chord plugged in.Even on the 2.1 port the charger cannot keep up with an iphone 5S. With every thing off on the iphone (air plane mode screen off etc) it gave a 15% charge in 2 hours. That's 7.5% per hour.When using Waze GPS the charge drops from 100% to 90% in 10 minutes.I would not recommend this charger.
2	I can have this plugged in from Atlanta to Greensboro and the phone isn't much more charged than when I started.  But the phone doesn't die either.
2	used for 1 month before it broke - also not 2.1 amps  - both usb slots do not produce enough current for sgs4
0	Product quality of this item is very very poor.  After charging my phone for 15 minutes the charger began to overheat and the charge on my phone started to fail.  Had to return this item for refund.
2	I like the small profile for this charger but as with all the USB cable chargers I've tried it seems to charge somewhat slowly.  Trying to run the GPS navigation while charging it will still slowly drain the phone.  It seems the dedicated car chargers (with no USB port) seem to charger much faster.
2	The only thing I did not like about the charger is that only one of the plus is 2.1Amp the other is only one amp is unable to charge any of my devices. I will be looking for a stronger one.
2	I love my Kindle Fire but I hate the micro plug.when plugging in a charger cord I find that sometimes it doesn't recognize that the plug is in and sometimes I have to jiggle it a little to get the charging box to turn green to show that it is in fact charging. I cannot stand the A/C wall charger that came with the Fire. It is ridiculously short making it very difficult to find a place to charge it safely and I have purchased several of these cords since last Christmas and a majority work for a while and then break or don't work at all. Sometimes it is hit or miss and then sometimes a cord charges and then sometimes it acts up and refuses to charge. I have the same plug on my Samsung Stratosphere and I don't seem to have the same problem.With this cord the part that plugs into the Fire virtually fell apart. I don't care how much you pay for one of these type of cord they should all work. When I started using it this cord appeared on my visual inspection to be well made but I guess looks are deceiving. The cord of course fell apart after the return date so I'm stuck.I really don't recommend this cord. I realize that it could be just a single defective onebut of the three other reviews only one person out of four of us recommended this cord. So just beware.
2	When I bought these I thought they'd fast charge a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 but they don't.  They will slow charge.  I have tried multiple cables including the original Samsung cable which allows for a fast charge but found this didn't help.  Somewhere I read that they have to be specially configured to fast charge a Samsung device or otherwise they'll charge slowly despite which port of the charger you use.
2	I had a previous version of this product a few years ago. It lasted for about two year until a capacitor blew out. You could see it through the translucent case. I like the previous version. This one not so much.The AC prongs do not fold in so they are in the way when being used in a lighter outlet or stored in a pocket or computer back.It's larger than the combination of some separate ac only and 12v only chargers I have so there is no space savings.When connected to my ipad or my razr maxx the screen keyboard malfunctions. Spurious and random characters are generated when the screen is touched instead of the keys that should be detected. Unplugging the cable immediately stops this problem.I contacted BoxWave and they did send me a return shipping label. I have not gotten around to returning the charger yet. I dont know if this is a design issue or if I just got a bad unit. But the first two issues are reasons I would not recommend these even if the malfunction is just a bad unit.
0	Bought this to use in our brand new 2014 Nissan Altima.  From the first time we plugged it in it only worked if we jiggled it just right. Definitely not a 2.0 amp charger either.  Will spend the extra dough to get one directly from the T-Mobile retailer. Not worth the return shipping cost for a refund.  Only buy this if you feel like donating some money to a foreign company in Asia just for fun.
2	I liked this case a lot until the plastic shell started cracking after owning it for one month. Unfortunately when you buy it through Amazon Boxwave would not provide a replacement because I had purchased through Amazon and not directly through them. I liked it a lot but it is now unusable.
2	This case looks *FANTASTIC* seriously. It's easily one of the classiest most beautiful cases I've ever owned for a phone. The leather is great it feels comfortable it's just a seriously awesome case.The problem is I want to use it as a basic wallet as well and it fails miserably at that. The entire case is so tight you can hardly fit your cards in (I only want 3 cards and my drivers license. The fit is so tight you can barely get them in once you do the case doesn't close very well over the phone.I guess I could go back to a wallet but I really didn't want to do that. I wanted to use this as a pick up my phone and my car keys and go arrangement. No more fumbling for wallet but this cannot fit that bill. This case would have been far better off leaving all the extra storage out and letting it close nicely. Overall this case is wasted for me just doesn't cut it even though I so badly wanted it to.
0	It is not leather and its smell is atrocious. However if you're okay with leatherette it does have some nice pockets inside and it's relatively thin/lightweight.I'd avoid this seller though (BoxWave Corp). Shipping is $5 and you will pay to return the item to them. For me it was a total waste of money as the shipping costs alone are likely far more than the product is worth. I paid $30 for the case $5 for shipping to me. I'll be sending it flat rate back. Bear Mountain cases are better real leather and cost less (about $20 for the iPad Mini).
2	I love the case and it came 2 days early but there is some gripes i have. first of all there is a strong chemical smell as if the case was just freshly stained and second I had to remove the back of my galaxy s3 phone in order to get it to fit in the new case. and ive had it and been using it for 3-4 hours now and the smell is all through my house. it makes my throat hurt and im coughing so im going to leave the case outside for a couple of days and see if the smell goes away. I hope it does because i really wanted to use that case.I will update in a few days. if anyone has any suggestions on how to make the smell go away please let me know.update: ok i left the case outside for 24 hours and it seems to be ok now. but i still have to remove the back of my phone for it to fit. my phone is the galaxy s3 SGH-I747
0	This Classic Book iPhone case is flimsy and the cover will not remain closed. Not good protection for an iPhone.
2	Let's start off with the fact that this is a well made case and fit my Nexus 4 flawlessly. The workmanship was good and after an initial breakin period that lessened the oil seepage and the smell I was very pleased with the feel. I used this for about two months before switching and had almost no wear or other issues. I tend to carry very small wallets and had hoped to use this product to combine the wallet and the phone into one convenient package.But still it just didn't work out. It was awkward to hold while making phone calls because of the large spine on the case and I'm old school in that I actually talk on the phone. And the wallet portion wasn't quite up to snuff. By the time I put my driver's license in there (an exceptionally tight fit on the windowed part of the case and I was almost not able to remove it later) and a couple of credit cards it was actually too thick to keep in any pocket comfortably. The covers of the case are very thick while they protect the phone and contents two of them are too much when combined with the thickness of my thin Nexus 4 and a couple of credit cards. I tried keeping it in a hammer pocket in my carpenter's jeans and in some cargo pants but it was too high to fit well into those pockets.I really like the concept of this thing but it just didn't do what I hoped it would.
2	I used the Motorola H500 before and the sound clarity is not as good as the Jabra BT250v. So I bought this product June 30 to replace my H500. Received it July 11th. The person in the other end of the line noticed that I sounded clearer and louder. Used it while driving to test sound clarity and it passed. My Jabra250v was just used for minutes of light usage (3 hours max in 7 days) but the headphone stopped working August 15. The person on the other line can hear me fine but I don't hear anything from the headset. I asked Amazon for a refund or replacement but Al from from customer service emailed me this Unfortunately more than 30 days have passed since you received this item and we are not able to provide a replacement. Our return policy states that within 30 days of delivery of your order you may return any merchandise in new condition with the original packaging and accessories or any defective merchandise for a full a refund or replacement.  Fair enough.He gave me a phone number to the Jabra corporation: 619-622-0764&lt;---this number does not work. So I had to go to the Jabra website and ask them for a replacement and or refund. As of August 17 12:54am EST I have not heard anything from the company.This could be an isolated case. And for a good brand name like Jabra I hope it is. But it sucks when you get a faulty piece of equipment. I hope you have a better experience with this product than what I have experienced. Just do know that this product is not free from possible defects.
0	Perhaps I just got a bad one but this thing won't consistently work 4 feet away from the phone let alone the 30 they claim. It's a nice design and if it worked I'd be very happy with it.UPDATE: I just got a new BT250v after Amazon was kind enough to exchange my unit sight unseen (they even shipped out the new unit before I'd shipped back the bad one). Unfortunately while the new unit works somewhat better it still doesn't work as well as it should. For example there is noticeable popping (interference) if i put my phone in my pocket even on the same side as the headset. I've tried many combinations of phone and headset and the only time I have problem is with this headset so I'm quite sure it's not an issue with my phone or with bluetooth in general. (In fact I've had far better luck with other Jabra BT products.) So the design is beautiful and the product is great when it works but I've found that it fails when I really need it.FINAL UPDATE: I chucked it. Don't believe the breathless reviews about this. If you use this in everyday life--i.e. with the phone more than a few feet from your head--people on the other end will hear static. I got so sick of people asking me what's that clicking sound? that I threw the stupid thing away. I'm amazed people love this so much. They must be so floored by the idea of wireless technology they haven't actually tried using it for a real conversation or they haven't actually tried to call another person. With two bad experiences with this company that was the last Jabra product I'll ever buy.
2	1st month very good. 2nd month dropping calls and no one can seem to hear me.  It was like I was not on a wireless bluetooth.  It was bad having to always disconnect this because everyone on the other line could not hear or understand me.  I replaced this after 2 months with the Samsung WEP and have had no problems.  Not worth it.
2	I've used this earpiece as has my wife. We both liked it when it worked but after a short drop from the dashboard to the carpeted floor it stopped working. I also think it's a bit large in these days of ever smaller bluetooth devices.
2	I bought this headset at the same time as my Verizon Palm Treo 650.  Pairing was a snap and it supported the hands free profile.  The call quality was great on both ends (however wind or car A/C caused people on the other end to have lower quality).  I only charged it twice - day one and one week later.  I used it for about a total of one to two hours a day on my commute.There was just one drawback and it was a deal-breaker for me.  I wear glasses and the bulk of the headset behind the ear made it very uncomfortable.  I returned the headset today after I had to end my call on the way home after 20 minutes.  If you don't wear glasses this is an ideal bluetooth headset for the Treo 650.
2	First time I bought this to pair up with my jabra a210 bluetooth adapter.  Worked fine except that the vibrate feature won't work.  Then I exchanged it for another one.  This time the vibrate works but the call pickup button would not work.  It works for power up/power down.  But I can't pickup any incoming calls.  The button simply wouldn't work for that functionality.  I tried it with few phones and it doesn't work.  I already exchanged the jabra adapter once.  Now I'm sick of exchanging it.  I think jabra has bad quality control.  Someone in the quality control shd be fired!  Everytime you exchange something you run into a new problem.
0	The range on the headset was pathetic - maybe 2 or 3 feet from the phone to get a decent signal (which defeats the entire puprpose of a CORDLESS headset IMHO).  Otherwise it was horrific - static terrible sound quality etc.  Please do not waste money on that POS.  I swapped it out for the Moto H850 and am much happier with that unit paired up with my MotoE815.
0	BT250 and this newer BT250v are pure junk.  The sound quality on these two units are horrid there are no other ways to describe it.  My friends and coworkers can identify these units remotely and asked that I do not speak to them using the BT250 or BT250v.  The microphone is sooooo sensitive and un-tuned it is particularly unusable in cars or while walking.  The road noise or wind noise will over saturate your voice.  Even under ideal quiet surrounding normal speech will come out muddy and weak.  The battery life also shortens significantly during the  1 year warranty with moderate use.  The button on this unit doesn't help with usability.  With the earhook design one would push the button in the direction perpendicular into the ear to activate the button a task easily done with one finger and no pain.  However this unit uses the behind the ear design where you would have to use two fingers with a motion to pinch your earlobe to activate the button it's truly an unpleasant experience.  In addition the vibrate alert feature is just stupid and useless.  In most cases one would be wearing this unit so the audible ringing can be heard--why would you need it to vibrate???I truly advise against buying this unit.
0	One of the most worthless items I've ever had.  No troubleshooting information in the manual.  Works when it wants as opposed to when I want.  Charge doesn't seem to last a day without any use.  Whoever thought a blue flashing light on your ear was stylish should get a lobotomy.I give up on bluetooth.  And mostly nomo MotoOne star because I can't give it a lower vote.
0	I returned this product because it was clearly a used headset.  There were scratches on the front and a small dent.  Frankly I do not want to insert a used product into my ear.  I went to Wal-mart and bought the very same product for less money.
2	It works fine. It connects consistently and the sound quality is acceptable but the battery life is not so good. The stand-by battery life could be a lot better.
0	I own this headset and the sound quality is very poor.  I end up having to pick up the handset manually so I can hear the person on the other end.  This defeats the purpose of hands free in a car.  In a quiet room it works fine.  Do not buy this if you intend to use it in a car bus or train.
2	First why so big?I like that the microphone turns the unit off/on but that is it.The ear piece has thin rubber around edge of speaker that eventually pealed off. Doesn't really impact comfort or help with cupping sound into ear so I'm not sure why that is there.The WORST part of this headset and the other 3 Motorola headsets I've had is that they take forever to activate during a call.  When my phone rings and I'm using my Samsung headset my call is picked up almost instantly when using any of my Motorola headsets there is literally a 2-3 second pause after answering the phone until the headset is picked up.Often by the time my headset picks up people on the other end are already saying Hello?  are you there?I won't buy another Motorola headset that's for sure.I gave it a 3 because I like the flip on/off & how it fits in my pocket because of that and that it does work.  It just doesn't compete with my Samsung or Plantronics headsets.
0	As a long-time Motorola bluetooth headset user I can tell you from painful experience that there are fundamental flaws in the HS850.  In fact I went through FOUR HS850 headsets (under warranty) before Motorola decided to upgrade me to the H700 (despite the lower model number the H700 is a newer model).The HS850 and H700 have the same characteristics:- Over-the-ear swing arm earpiece that can be used on left or right ear- Flip-open boom microphone that turns the headset on/off- Easy volume controls- Toggle switch to connect/disconnect calls (or put them on hold/mute)- Easy pairing- Good published battery life- Standard Motorola power connectorsWhat's the difference?  Well good published battery life is the distinction.  All four of the HS850 headsets worked for a few weeks or months but then would not hold a charge.  Battery life went down to MINUTES.Dealing with Motorola support was a nightmare.  Apparently their support center for these products was in Argentina and they could only do what was in their script to help me.  After the fourth failure I insisted on getting a support contact at their corporate HQ in Illinois.  That support contact was a dream.  After reviewing my case he gave me the H700 as a replacement.  I had that headset for 1.5 years and it had kept its battery life and functionality.  Of course I lost it and had to buy a replacement...and given all the choices I got another H700.Do NOT fall for the lower price of the HS850.  I've seen prices as low as $15 for this model.  I think you'll be frustrated and disappointed in the end.
2	Bought this to replace the HS820 simply for the flip-on functionality. After about 2 months of use I have concluded that with the exception of the flip-on trick the HS820 is actually a better headset. Mainly due to the volume. The HS820 has MUCH more volume and even seemed to fit on the ear a little better. Not a bad unit at all but the volume and fitment issues should have been resolved before product release.
0	I have a Treo 650 on Sprint PCS with a firmware update of 1.08For the most part I actually like this headset because it is very comfy and people seem to hear me well (the comfort is a big deal as I often wear glasses)however this headset takes a long time to connect with the T650 --- a good 7 to 10 seconds on most calls (and by then most people have hung up)in addition the volume is okay in the car (or other isolated places) but forget about using it outside or in noiser environmentsI've heard that it works well with Moto products though ---- for Treo 650 users I highly recommend the Scala 500 which has fast connection times and loud volumehappy shopping!!!
2	I love not having the wire but the microphone is so close to the earpiece that everyone I talk to with the headset is annoyed and complains about hearing themselves (in echo). This problem can be diminished somewhat by turning the volume down but then I can't hear the person I'm talking to either (unless I'm in a perfectly silent place). Other than this design flaw the headset is a nifty gadget with elegant controls good battery life etc.
2	I was very dissapointed with its audio performance. I don't want to write a lot because others have definitely written the positive features in good detail(good microphone quick connect good battery life light-weight etc.) but the usability is very restricted.Here is the bottom line if you want to take this unit outside of your office/home/any quiet environment you will NOT be able to hear the other person even if the environment is moderately noisy (this is at unit's highest volume). I was using this in the car and I can hear faint at best when the road is good but when you pass through slightly patchy freeway the other person's voice is completely drowned. The speaker's maximum volume is just completely unacceptable. By the way this experience was inside a luxury car not a cardboard car. I am not sure the reason behind this design could be to improve battery life?I had high expectations. I am returning this unit to Amazon and will look at the Jabra BT500 (read good reviews about it: in-ear position & USB charging).By the way I used this with my Blackberry 7100g good syncing and quick connection.
2	As an early adopter of mobile technology I am always seeking new wireless gadgets to improve my productivity.  So after a friend reported having good success with the HS850 I acquired one on eBay.  Unfortunately the sound quality is below expectations and I continue to use my wired headset.My cell phone goes with me everywhere especially when I drive.  Hence I have been using wired headset for the past ten years.  The tangling of the headset wire with itself and my mp3 headphones gets rather annoying.  So I was looking forward to time when the reviews of Bluetooth headsets became positive in the press.When I purchased this model the information I saw was rather positive especially about the form factor.  The model is both light and easy to operate.  It intelligently turns on when flipping open the boom.  However the ring which goes around your ear is just is barely strong enough to keep the headset on.  While it hasn't fallen off it constantly feels like it might whenever my head is moving.My big complaint with the HS850 is the sound quality. Not only is there a slight hiss but there is also a slightly noticeable electronic digitization.  I would think by 2006 this problem would be corrected.  It sounds very much like the first generation of digital cell phones.  Because of this I would recommend considering other models.ProsSmallLightweightConsMediocre sound qualityDoesn't hold tightly enough.
2	First of all I love the idea of a cordless headset and I have a Motorola phone so I thought getting a Motorola bluetooth headset would give me the best sound quality. I think that the HS850 is a nice design but has flaws the actual ear piece would do better if it sat just inside the ear (Like an earbud) the way it is now sitting just up against the ear makes it difficult to hear your party. More times than not you have to press it against your ear. I also think that the users voice comes out a bit muffled and people complain that they can't really hear you. Lastly this headset needs improvement it terms of cancelling out wind noise. I look forward to future models addressing these issues. All in All I mostly enjoy this device even with the flaws.
0	Sucks.... I want even keep this one. First it use a non usb charger and its too big and bulk this needs to put in the trashed and buried on another planet.
2	This is a decent Bluetooth headset.static in generalis tolerable unlike many of Motorola's other (and pricier) headsets.However the volume level is far too low.  One has to literally press the headset against one's ear when driving on the freeway.On the bright side the open/fold of the boom to turn the headset on/off is and innovative feature unique to Motorola headsets (and not all of them at that).
2	When it comes to headsets the sound quality is the bottom line for me. I'm sorry to say that this one doesn't have it. I found the function excellent and especially liked the folding boom mike. The fit was a bit loose but not a huge problem. The big issue for me was the muffled sound both for me and the caller. The other problem is that in a noisy environment holding a conversation became a real problem. I have tested 8 different headsets by pairing two of them at a time putting one in each ear and switching between them during a call. This lets me and the caller make a reasonable comparison of sound quality. Only one of the other 7 I tested did worse. (I also tested the Motorola H700 and found it to have the same pros and cons as this one.)
2	I bought this headset to replace my HS820.  I previously used both the Motorola HS850 and the HS820 and had the same two problems with each.- Insecure attachment to my ear.- Insuffcient volumeWhenever I moved the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel as if they were about to fall off. They never did but it was still annoying.The volume problem was in part related to this. The contact with my ear wasn't very firm and the ambient noise that the headsets let in coupled with a relatively low volume meant that I had to press the headset to my ear to hear clearly.I gave it 2 stars rather than one because of the GREAT battery life.I finally bought a Plantronics 510 and have been very satisfied.
2	Have been using this unit for over a year and for the most part I like it.Pros: Easy BT connection to my LG VX8300.  Easy to carry in your pocket.  Simple to use. Light. Great range. very good battery life. Like the 'flip open the mike to turn it on' feature.Cons: I have trouble hearing people when there's a lot of ambient noise due to the lack of an earbud that goes in the ear.  For this reason my next BT headset will definitely be of the 'earbud' design.  Always feels like it's about to fall off but generally doesn't - still distracting.  A little trouble maintaining a good connection with the phone when my phone is close to my body in my belt holster or pocket (though this could actually be a problem with the phone's BT antenna being in close proximity to my body).  It never has a problem if my phone is sitting on a table even when I'm 20-30 feet away.Overall a good headset.  But after only a year I am having trouble getting the charger to connect and the shroud around the ear speaker has come off.
2	I bought this earpiece a month ago to go with my brand new Nextel i870.  It worked sorta ok but was a bit finiky when used with my phone in my belt holder.  I didnt wear it all the time just when I was commuting to and from work.  I kept it in my pocket so it would be on standby in contact with my phone.  Most times it would connect quickly and function well.  Ocassionally it would seem to connect but when I attempted an outgoing call it would disconnect.I also had trouble hearing the unit while driving.  As I am approaching my mid 50's my hearing is not as acute as in past years and the internal noise from the pickup truck (windows up and AC running) makes hearing the other party on the earpiece difficult.My main problem with this unit is the recharge plug.  I have 3 Nextel/Motorola phones that use this type of plug and have not had any trouble with it.  The plug end has a release button to depress when unplugging.  The catch on my HS850 charger plug was more difficult to release and required much more pressure to release than my other 2 Motorola charger plugs of the same type.  This contributed to undue stress on the socket and eventually the socket pulled loose.  I probably charged it 6-7 times over the month I had it.I intend to replace my HS850 with some other type that has an earpiece that fits in my ear providing some sound isolation from environmental noises rather than the lay on this ear type.Be careful unplugging this unit from its charging plug.
2	I like the look of this headset and I really like the fact that flipping the boom turns it on and off instantly.However the Motorola HS850 performs much worse than my much older Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset.  Everyone I call indicates that I sound muffled and callers typically ask me to discontinue the use of the headset.  Also the earpiece speaker is not that loud so it is rather hard for me to hear callers when there is background noise (e.g. in the car).I just purchased this a couple of weeks ago.  I am giving it to a friend and ordering a different one (Plantronics Voyager 510?).
2	I got two of these.  One for my wife and one for me.  I can not tell when she calls me if she is on the phone or using the headset ( maybe that is more a comment on the phone :) ).The voice interface of the phone has more to do with how well this works.  On my wife's phone she has to train each contact she wants to voice dial.  Not very practical.  On my phone it just figures it out but sometimes I am not certain who it has decided to call.  We both end up dialing through the phone and using the headset to talk and answer calls.  (We both have Verizon WM5 PDA phones.)
2	I had this bluetooth for a week then I started having issues.  It would disconnect from my phone on its own and then stopped connecting all together.  In addition it isn't that comfortable to wear for a long period of time.
2	Hello Since I am the tech guy at the homestead I am not the user but hear everything wrong about something when I get it for my wife (sound familiar guys?) I bought this in spring 2012 she used it for two months and liked it and had no complaints about it I was her hero! But by June it was dead-o-roonie and I was in the dog house again! Any-hoo I was asked to purchase again. I felt the Motorola name that came along with 900+ reviews was enough to make this a good purchase never mind the price under twenty bux? I know I know what do you expect for such a low price point? Alot something that works for a year or more and it seems so did 900+ other buyers. Well I am onto the Motorola H730 everyone is abuzzin' about that one also and I will try it for my ever lovin' and see if I can be her hero again for a few months or more? I am quite sure this unit is out of warranty but if any of you literature readers know about the warranty of this item. Post it here? Thanks in advance.
2	I bought this bluetooth earpiece with my Sony Ericsson P900 a couple of years ago and it's still going strong. I do not have any problems with it and have used it extensively.  It's great to have some kind of hands-free wireless device.  This one sits on my ear and is out of the way.After 2 years of use the silicone part around the earpiece that seals the earpiece to your ear has come away from from the plastic.  Not really a big deal but it is breaking away from normal use.  I've never dropped it or abused it in any way so I would have expected it to last longer than this.  Performance is still good though.It does sit a little precariously on my ear it's just a light wrap around my ear so if I lean over too much there is a danger it can fall off.  Care must be taken when you're wearing it.  And even though it is one of the smaller wireless units it's still heavy after wearing it for a few hours.  Battery life is good and charging is easy.If buying another one I would look for one that can sit more securely on my ear but I would have no problems sticking with this brand.
2	Do not remember probably changed phones and may find it in a draw one day. I am sure it came and everything was o.k.
2	This fit my Verizon V3M Razr fit on my person comfortably while driving and would be a great gadget if it were not for the HUGE ear bud.  I have large earcanals and this earbud does not even come close to fitting in it.  Rediculous!Most reputable earbud companies (V-Moda Bose and Shure) have different size earbuds for each individual.  I am disappointed in this product...
0	The sound is horrible... people say I sound like I am in a muffled tunnel. And I bought two to have in case the BT ran down.... poor me..... And my Plantronics 620 works like cr*p too. No noise cancellation worth a d*mn... forget about using it when driving a car.... I am trying to find a new one...
0	Even though this ear piece is designed for a razor phone the ear bud is too big uncomfortable and it keeps falling off the ear. After two weeks of use the on/off switch stopped working and this feature was the main reason why I bought this unit. In sum it was a waste of money. There was no provision in this review for 0 stars so I gave it 1
2	Good headset good sound Great price. I had another brand I bought at a store for $19 (which I returned) the sound works better on this one. Its sound wasn't as good as this one and the fit was bad. This one has good sound and the fit is better than the other one (although not perfect). I can't complain.
0	I don't see what others have liked about this.  It doesn't add any value -- doesn't make the phone easier to carry or use doesn't add significant protection or do anything else.  I'd recommend getting a pouch with a slide-on clip that holds the phone horizontally on your belt or waistband.
2	It worked for the small time we needed it. Didn't like the antenna but hey the phone range and made calls. It had a calculator too!i know..big whoop!
2	This was my first clamshell phone and I like that aspect of the phone but that's about it.  It seems to have worse reception than my previous phones (all Nokia bar type) in the same coverage areas.  The biggest issue is definitely the battery.  I am NOT a heavy cell phone user so I like to just leave the phone in my car or gym bag and not worry about it for a couple days.  This phone will drain in 8 hours to 36 hours - with MINIMAL USAGE.  I don't know why it drains so quickly or with what seems to be random speeds but it is extremely frustrating.  Also I am not thrilled with the intuitiveness (or lack thereof) of the menus but I am sure I would have become familiar with them in time.  I won't have a chance on this phone since I am looking to return mine ASAP.CONS:POOR Battery LifeWorse reception than previously owned phonesNot comfortable to holdPROS:Looks goodCompact
2	I owned the V300 and found it to be a bit quirky strange things would happen when ever I charged it when it was finished all the personal settings would revert back to factory standard. They seemed to have fixed that with this latest version of the phone. My understanding is that they have combined the features from both the v300 and the v 600 to make this phone. I've only had it for 1 week and so far so good I always enjoyed functions such as speaker phone voice dialing and voice memos now I get the blue tooth and a much better redesigned key pad along with video clip capabilities. All of this is good news! If I had to pick a down side I would have to say that I'm dissapointed that Motorola decided to make this phone look exactly like the v300. I like what the body of the phone feels like but a change of color would be better maybe silver.
2	Loved the idea of moving back to a palm device after my sony p900 died. Constant lockups requiring the removal of the battery to reboot even after doing a firmware update made me return this to amazon. Will wait for the new sony.
2	Yeah it's a sim card and well my phone doesn't have 3G so I don't really care that it works with 3G because it doesn't matter.I don't know why they want reviews on sim cards. I find SIM cards outdated though They are massive compared to Micro SD cards and yet they hold next to no information when compared.The only reason SIM cards are good is because they go in GSM phones and if you unlock your phone you can cart it off to another service provider without issue. Especially quad band phones.
2	When I got my new LG Xenon through Amazon they sent me a new sim card too.  I didn't change it out right away as when I put my old sim card in my new phone it worked.  But then a few weeks later I tried to add a data feature to my phone from the AT&T; website and I had some problems.  The data feature wouldn't add.  When I called AT&T; they figured it was because I was still using my old sim card so I put the new card in at that time and everything worked ok from then on.I'm guessing (and I'm really just guessing here...) that along with other things that the new sim card does it also somehow allows AT&T; to make sure that the folks that have phones that MUST use a $30 data package GET a $30 data package.  This is totally a guess on my end but that was the feeling I got from customer service when I called.Made me wonder if a used iPhone would work on the network and if using an old sim card if you would not HAVE to get the data package from AT&T.;  Of course then you would be limited to connecting to a wireless connection (like a computer) for email and internet but then not everyone needs email and the internet all the time. But maybe this would be cheating AT&T;?  If you buy an iPhone used and connect over AT&T; are you contracted to use the $30 data package no matter what?Anyway I'm sure I'm missing data here because this is not very clear but I thought it was interesting...  The new sim card is working fine now.
0	****UPDATED on OCT. 18 2010*sigh*I really tried to make this work for me but it just is not worth the hassle.  As previously speculated I wonder if wearing glasses is the reason for the poor fit. I traveled quite a bit last weekend and found that more often than not my headset disconnected itself from my phone after a call.  My hands-free-device turned into a pull-over-and-muck-with-it-after-each-call burden.  Maybe I didn't have some obscure setting correct but I looked all over and couldn't find one.  Maybe mine was defective I'm not sure but it was really more trouble than it was worth.  In almost ten years of ordering from Amazon I am taking advantage of the return policy for the first time.I found a different headset at 73% off but still $40 (orig $150 / Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece in gold) and it comes with its own chargeable case. Never seen a case that not only protects but also charges!  Other colors are a bit more. Check that one out if you wear glasses.  It fits into the ear not over the top so I am hoping for a better fit.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *I was expecting more after reading the reviews.Let me first say that the sound quality is excellent.  Sent myself a voice-mail while rolling the windows up and down on the freeway without an appreciable loss of sound quality!  Amazing in itself but you could barely tell the difference from all windows up and driver/passenger window down.HOWEVER.... I wear glasses and have a rounder face.  It is difficult to place the earpiece on my ear with glasses on.  The bulky part doesn't sit well on my glasses' frame.  The mouthpiece is not adjustable.  I have fuller cheeks and the mic comes in contact with my face.  Not sure why it was made that way since not all faces are the same.  The control buttons are also difficult to manage while driving.  The main control on the side is fine but the tiny on/off and volume buttons were hard to find and press without dislodging the unit.  I turn it on before I place it on my ear.  Maybe that has something to do with it sitting on my eyeglasses frame. I do like the sound quality and will continue to use it for a while before coming back to update.  If it doesn't work well for me I'm sure one of my kids will like it.  (I ended up returning it.  See above)Would also recommend getting a case for it to corral the charger and unit in one place.
2	The newer Voyager Pro is much much better but this was a good bluetooth device in it's day. Not as tough as I would have liked though.
2	This headset generally works though there was times I needed to re-pair it. My problems with it that are:1) Its hard to turn off - if you pay attention you can turn it off easy enough but nothing like the Motorola H700 where you just flip the boom.2) It's big! It's comfy enough on your ear but its huge in your pocket and since things stick out of it its hard to get out of your pocket.3) Flashing blue light is way too bright! When is dark and I'm in the car I keep thinking that the cops are behind me the way it blinks so brightly. It disturbed my passengers too.4) Wind tolerance - it's better than my H700 but its still too noisy to hold a conversation in any level of wind.I'm sending mine back and getting another H700.
2	This is the first headset that I ever bought that did not come with any instructions I can not load it on my phone
2	Pros:* I love the fit. Very balanced and hard to lose while working out. A big plus over the Motorola H700 I had before that was always falling off. This is significant because this is a replacement for the H700 I lost jogging in the rain.* Outbound voice quality is reported superior to my old Motorola by my friends.* Incoming sound is as good as the Motorola and actually a bit better when you account for the fit to ear seal.Cons:* Claims of 6 hours of talk time are greatly inflated.  More like 3 right off the charger. This is a problem. Now I need a car charger for it.* Too many buttons and not intuitive. Not responsive sometimes to commands. Sluggish switching.* The ear pieces cost you a certain amount of ambient hearing of your environment. Whatever size you use it still really cuts down on your hearing of the world around you on that side. Compared to the floppy Motorola this is extreme. The Motorola had no impact on hearing that I would notice.The talk time is my biggest complaint. The rest is just nitpicking.
2	The Plantronics Voyager 510 is a good bluetooth headset for its current price.  However depending on how you plan to use it it could either become a great headset or a nightmare.The first thing you notice out of the box is that it's quite large both in the size of the battery pack that hangs over your ear and especially the depth of the microphone.  Put another way it sticks out quite a bit from your cheek rather than laying flat against your face.  This not only can cause some sound quality issues but also makes it very conspicuous.  So if you prefer to keep a low profile while working hands-free this may not be the best one for you.  The size of the piece that hangs over your ear also makes wearing glasses or even a hat an issue.  All that said the unit is very comfortable provided you don't have anything else hooked over your ear.  It's also easily configured for either ear.Sound quality can be very good but only in quiet environments.  Even small amounts of wind noise will render the microphone useless.  I've been surprised to have people complain to me that voicemails that I've left have been all broken up even when I was in what I thought was a quiet place.I've also found that reception will be spotty unless the phone is placed closer than normal to the headset.  For instance in order to maintain good signal I typically have to have my phone in my shirt pocket.  But on the plus side the unit is very easy to set up with a variety of phones and PDAs immediately connecting to it with no effort.This headset would be ideal for someone who is looking to use it exclusively in an indoor office while working hands-free.  You'd get optimal sound and would be able to connect to all of your devices quickly and easily.  You wouldn't even feel self-conscious about the unit's size.  But for those on the go its reception and microphone quality are too poor to recommend.PROS*  Excellent battery life means very little downtime for charging*  Simple to set up - instantly compatible with numerous devicesCONS*  Sound quality from the microphone especially in places with even minimal background noise*  Big bulky design makes fit difficult especially with glasses or a hat
2	This is my 3rd bluetooth headset and my 2nd Plantronics.Plusses: works really well with my phone even up to 20' away. I've dropped it lots of times and it's holding up nicely. Easily adjusts to either ear. Turns on & off easily.Negatives: People complain they can't hear me on a regular basis (even when there isn't noise around me). Is awful with wind noise. Is much clunkier than my last Plantronics (330). My phone knows it's there but is often very slow to transfer over to the headset.Overall I am disappointed with the headset - other than the range between it & the phone it's is not as good as the Plantronics 330.
2	I've heard great things about this so I tried it. Everything is great about it except two things that made me want to return it.First there is a little bit of crackling once my phone is across my body on my hip and that is annoying to me because I've had some that never do that. I've noticed that Plantronics and Jabra tend to have this issue regularly with their headsets. The other thing is that it is bulky and I prefer something a little more pettite.It does have good battery life and noise cancellation. So it's a matter of preference when it comes to the things I disliked about it!
0	As many people complained I found this headset's microphone was very weak. The other person can not hear me at all.  So I contacted Plaintronics for repair.  Their repair process has no tracking just sending in your headset to an address.  Two weeks later I received a used one back not the one I sent in packaged in an OEM box. Although this one has better microphone than the new one I sent in it battery is not very reliable to hold charge also the battery portion is kind of loose.I can not recommend Plantronics product at all.
2	This is my second voyager 510.  The first one I had was great but the charge wasn't lasting anymore so I ordered this as a replacement....very disappointed with the clarity of the unit.  Lots of static in the background on my end.  People on other end don't seem to hear it so I just deal with it.
2	I don't know if it's just me but every time I buy a blue-tooth it's only great for a couple of months. Read the reviews and was excited but slowly performance diminished.
2	Definitely a much better headset than the other two Motorola models that I also own -- it is loud clear and the battery lasts a good two days between stand-by and light/medium use. It is a little larger in size but it is light in weight and comfortable for extended wear (3-4 hours at a time).There is one drawback the unusual power cord/plug. After only 1-2 months of use the headset started to not charge properly unless the plug is connected to the bottom of the headset just right.***10/2008***I liked it so much I bought one for my wife. Unfortunately hers die within 2 months with very light use. And I mean 'light' -- it spent most of its life sitting on her nightstand. The light indicator went dark (not turned off) and it wasn't picking up her voice when she speaks into it. We returned it for a replacement and this one appears to be working just fine.
2	I've used the Plantronics Voyager 510 for a few months and have been quite satisfied with the length of the battery charge reception volume and ability for others to hear me speak clearly.  The size of the headset is large compared to other headsets on the market and this is the only downside to this item.  Other headsets may look sleek chic or more cool but if good earpiece volume and clear transmission of your voice is critical this is the headpiece for you.  If the size of the headset the goes behind the ear was slightly slimmer I'd give it a full five stars.  The interchangeable earbuds are somewhat tricky to remove once installed.  That's the only other downside to this unit.  Otherwise a great headset.  I enjoy mine a great deal.Update to my previous review (August 2010): After using this headset for over two years I'm still fairly satisfied.  The only problems I've had was one of the earbuds was broken off after I mistakenly put the earpiece in my briefcase with several items the pressed against it.  Fortunately there are two other earbuds included with the headset and I easily replaced the broken one.  Also after a period of time I've noticed the foam cover for the earbuds tends to split at the seam.  If you're purchasing this headset for the first time it may be worth your money to buy and extra earbud/foam covers set.  Another problem is the headset momentarily disconnecting with my cell phone then connecting back.  At this time I don't know whether that is a result of problems with the headset or the phone.  Otherwise it has served me well and I've yet to have had anyone tell me that my voice was difficult to hear or understand while conversing in a variety of noisy conditions.  Considering how long I've used this headset and it's performance to date I can still recommend it to potential buyers.Another update to my previous review (September 2010).  Since my last update another issue has arisen with this headset.  The rubber material that houses the wiring and is the part that bends over your ear has cracked in two areas.  One is closer to the top (near the on/off switch) the other is at the end of the rubber tube just above the earpiece.  At the latter location the rubber is literally crumbling to pieces and exposing the wire cord within.  This is a very recent development and seems to be a part of decay based on age.  I realize after 2 1/2 years that no Bluetooth headset will look like new but if this deterioration keeps up a significant portion of the wire that runs from the battery to the earpiece/mic will be exposed.  When taking the construction into consideration there's no way to replace this portion of the headset.  Short of wrapping the rubber in electrical tape (which would only give an unsightly and temporary fix) the only other solution is buying another one.  But that doesn't make sense since the item is still in perfect working order has a great earpiece with clear sound and I've yet to have anyone complain about the quality of my voice through the mic even when I was in a noisy environment.Final update to two previous updates (September 2010).  The problem I wrote about in my last update has made me decide to never consider this model again.  The rubber portion that fits over my ear literally crumbled into several pieces two days ago.  Not only did this make the earpiece useless but the wiring broke off from the circuit board that's in the piece that goes behind your ear.  Long story short don't buy this model and expect to get several years of use.  If you're lucky and VERY careful in the way you carry store & use this item you'll be lucky to get two years of use out of it.  Otherwise I can't recommend it since there are so many other models that are equal to or better for less money.  I'll generously give it three stars...was tempted to give it only two but the boom mic is an asset...noise reduction is better than average...but that's about all.
2	The technology couldn't be better. Bluetooth conecteivity is simple to establish. The overall physical design is excellent. Though it looks heavy the unit is a featherweight and fits nicely around the ear. Long-term wearing is comfortable. Audio fidelity is excellent.Where the unit fails badly though is the controls. They do not provide enough tactile input. You cannot be certain of where the volume control is or which end of the rocker switch increases or decreases the volume. Since the volume defaults to moderately low setting this means you are likely to miss the first words of whatever your caller is saying which in turn means a lot of asking what did you say?.The Call Control button handles at least four different functions. On a phone equipped to handle all four functions it is easy to mistakenly select a function. For example on my phone if I hold the Call Control button a fraction too long the call is not answered but the prompt to enter a Voice Speed Dial entry is actuated. No fun when you are trying to answer a call.Plantronics provides three earpiece inserts and it's unlikely that one of them won't provide a comfortable snug fit.Overall excellent technology marred by poor ergonomics.Jerry
2	Item does work well as far as sound quality and setup ease. However ear loop is basically not adjustable at all consequently making the ear piece itself to constantly work its way out of my ear and feel as if it were just hanging there... After days of pushing ear piece back into my ear canal and hoping the loop would give a bit. i returned it for exactly those reasons... Great sound quality and no one i spoke to claimed to hear any distortion. just didn't fit well with no possible adjusting available...
0	I had Jabra when it first came out its battery stopped charging after 10 months. So I got this one as a replacement it too stopped charging after a year. This is the problem with all BT earpieces its battery is not replaceable which can be done if the industry wants to. They make more money by selling the whole unit vs we pay 5-10 dollars to replace battery. This kind of practice is not sustainable. I'm now back to the wired headset.
2	I bought this to pair with a Sony Ericsson Walkman phone and have been disappointed.1) Sound and voice quality are fine but this thing is way too sensitive to wind.  I can't use it outside if there is any wind current and even the air currents from my car's AC or heat are too much for it.2) Most disappointingly the microphone boom cracked in half after about 60 days.  I am working with Plantronics' warranty department but they need a date code which is unreadable without a magnifying glass.  I will update once I have some resolution.3) This device only works for the Ericsson's phone functions not music because the Walkman music functions use the A2DP Bluetooth protocol and the 510 is not A2DP compatible.  (Yes listening to music with just one earpiece could be lame but I would love to have podcasts on my phone).  For A2DP you need something like the Jabra 8010 or 8040.4) Contrary to some reviewers I didn't have any problem using this with glasses.  It's a little heavy but basically fine.
2	This was great for the first 2 months.  Month 3 it started dropping calls. By month 4 it was dropping more calls than it was answering.  I replaced it with another bluetooth because I couldn't take it anymore.  I wouldn't recommend this.  I now have the Samsung WEP and after a few weeks no problems as of yet.
2	The sound quality is tops both at the sending and receiving ends. However the ear hook is on the thick side. This can be a problem for ears that lie close to the head - the earhook pushes the ear away from the head. First this does create a rather odd looking mismatched pair of ears! Second it can become uncomfortable after prolonged use. It also poses a problem when wearing eyeglasses - one temple rests on top of the headset ear hook with the other at ear height. This causes the eyeglasses to rest lop-sided. So buyer beware. The sound quality is great. The comfort issue could be a problem for you.
2	i bought this one because of the excellent review however after pairing it to my Treo 650 and using it for a couple of days i'm quite disappointed.  The sound quality is ok sound level is on the low side and some noises from time to time.  i had a Samsung WEP200 too and had better quality than this one and Samsung WEP200 is about half of the price of this.  then there is the usability issue too sometimes i hear the phone ringing and pushed the button to accept the call and it wouldn't connect right away had to wait several seconds to establish the link the Samsung WEP200 and another Motorola ear piece i had did not have this problem.
0	I tried two of these headsets and it was horrible for the person I was speaking to. Some heard the echo worse than the others but all heard it. Some heard every word they said repeated back to them nearly as loud as my voice. Annoying to say the least and THANK YOU Amazon for being so amazing and taking both headsets back!
2	Works fine. But I'm still not happy. This is my third/fourth Plantronics headset.This one  bought for dual pairing with my LT and my cell phone.(iPhone).It works fine with both.I am subtracting marks for the followinga) Changing charger designs. Third headset none of the chargers are interchangeable so I always get the AC charger but have to buy the car chargerb) For iPhone this works only for the phone. Music will not work. Now I am looking instead at the Plantronics 855 Stereo Headset - do handle both = phone/music and still do dual pairing with LT
2	If you wear glasses most of the time like I do this headset will not be comfortable for you. In fact I couldn't keep it on without constantly adjusting it. So the sound was not good. I sent it back for a Sony over-the-head headset.
2	I bought this because of all the positive reviews and was surprised when it was not very good but Plantronics does not support my cell phone the Treo 755P. It would have been nice to know this from the web site prior to purchasing. I love the sound quality of the Jawbone but it does not fit me-and many others.The hunt continues and Plantronics says it does not have any bluetooth headsets for the 755P!Caveat emptor!
2	I've went through 3 of these bluetooth headsets in 5 years. When I got my first one it was extremely cheaper than offered now. The only reason I had to get my second one was because my dog chewed it up then I backed over my second one with my car in the driveway so I bought the third. Thinking I was still getthing the exact same quality as before I wanted to stick with what I knew. I connected it to multiple bt compatible devices with ease... PS3 iPod Touch iPhone Blackberry etc. All three times I purchased this product it ran no more than $30 but since they've redesigned it the quality has gone down & the price has increased to what you see now. I especially liked the fact that it had three different ear buds to accustom its users but the part that went around the ear became annoying at times. Pending on what you're doing cut I'd be cleanin & sweating & it wouldn't hold firm. Same thing if I walked outside (Note that I'm in Txso it's very humid) the ear piece would come out. Btw my third one is getting trashed because people can no longer hear me clearly and I only had this one for about 4 months. If you know better than this product stick with it because my 3 star rating is for the 4 years I had the previous version & not this new redesigned $126 version. You could absolutely do better elsewhere.Oh yea after a while of frequent use it began to split. I may try to show you guys a picture because with Platonics this design is known to do that. Lesson learned...
2	This is a great headset but for one thing. The voice call feature on my phone quit working when I upgraded from Windows Mobile 5 to 6. I called the phone manufactor the cell phone company and the headset company. None know what to do only it is incompatable with Mobile 6. Mobile 6 does not use voice tags on selected contacts. It changes voice to digital and looks for what you said. It cannot change the voice from this headset to digital. It works great on answering not calling with voice. It works great with calls that dial out also.So make sure your headset is compatable to Mobile 6 for voice calling. Of course this assumes that your phone can make voice calls.Again it works with Mobile 5
2	It wouldn't work if the phone and the Bluetooth were more than ten feet apart.  The pairing was not as bad but many times it would disconnect one line or the other
0	Unfortunately I purchased mine when it was $100 and have never been able to use it.  I didn't return it right away because I thought I would be able to read the directions that came with it and figure out how to unmute it but have never been able to.  I can hear the other people but they can't hear me.  No matter what I do it won't unmute.  The buttons on it are very small and difficult to use when it's in your ear.  I finally got a different bluetooth that works just fine.
2	So we purchased this headset because of all the mostly wonderful raving reviews.  For the first hour when my husband called me it sounded perfect.... I didn't even know that he had it on.  I breathed a sigh of relief.  Then he calls me later on and it is extremely choppy... the next day he is barely discernable and everytime the phone rings I can't even hear him.We are confused... it sounded perfect and then it went kaput.  He didn't drop it!  The only thing that he can come up with is that he was sweating because we were having a heat wave in NYC and maybe that messed it up.  The sweat; that is!So I called Amazon they sent me a new one which we will be trying out today.  I even called Plantronics at Amazons' suggestion just to make sure that it wasn't an issue on our end.  The verdict is that their customer service is exceptional!  Very helpful and took the time to understand my concerns.  We reset and resync'ed and still it sounds horrible.  Our phones are the Sprint Samsung Instincts.  Plantronics said that they do not have them on their list and they are still in the beginning testing phase and that may be the issue.So I gave it 3 stars for the first hours of use.  I am hoping that we truly received a dud and that it isn't a phone compatibility issue or sweat for that matter.  Will update soon!
2	For a few years I have been with verizon .My last phone was the Motorola e815 .Recently I retired and didn't need all the mins I got on the $39 plan(with taxes came to $44)  pro: I bought the razr v3 on ebay and transfered over to T-Mobile prepaid.the phone works just great and through my Parrot 3200ls handsfree sounds just great.con:When I went to program speed dialing .Boy was I disappointed .First it would only allow 20 voice tags .Then I had to record each individual tag for voice recognition My e815 allowed me to use unlimited voicetags and I didn't have to record my voice on each numberanyones voice would work using any name in my phone book .The Razr is supposed to be an improvement which it's not .The Motorola e815 was the best phone I ever owned and now Motorola screwed it up .Whats the point of using bluetooth handsfree dialing when you have to scroll down to a name to dialtaking your hands off the wheel  .Wake up Motorola Thats stupid .
0	I had a RAZR V2 and it was the best cell phone I ever had so I up graded to the RAZR V3 late last year (2007).  The RAZR V3 is by far the worst cell phone that I've owned.  It is beautiful and has great features but it keeps failing I have had 5 of these phones so far (the original purchased one plus 4 refurbished replacements) 1st phone: after a couple of months the screen would not light up / 2nd phone would not charge from the get go / 3rd phone after about a month the screen would no longer light up / 4th phone after a couple of months the screen would not light up / 5th phone has been working for about a month now.  I really like the RAZR phones WHEN THEY WORK but this V3 model has been terrible and I would rate it lower than 1 star if possible.
0	I purchased three of them in 2 weeks.  The phone is great but they all have the same problem:  the battery doesn't stay firm in its place and the phone turns off every 5 minutes.
2	i feel like i can never have enough of these especially since i lose this cord easily and a lot of people have the same charger so it's good for visitors and whole family.
0	Searched for droid 3 chargers when making my purchase. This was the first product to pop up had decent reviews and was cheap. I purchased 3. The product arrived on time. HOWEVER this product does NOT fit our droid 3 phones. I contacted customer service over the course of 9 times. No results in replacement return or refund. Contactd by phone and w/in the first 2 min of the convo the F-bomb was dropped twice. Very offensive and unprofessional. Needles to say I have 3 chargers that dont fit any of my phones. Anyone wanna trade?
2	This charger worked fine for a while but now it has a bad connection somewhere inside. I have to jiggle the body of it around until a good connection is produced. The problem is not the wall outlet -- this happens in any outlet in any building.
0	This was not what I was looking for therefore I sent it back. It did not work with my Droid Razr Maxx.
2	ok good product you get what you pay for works and is good for the pricee you cant go wrong
0	yea they sound great the bluetooth signal is awesome crystal clear with no hiss or pop or fading in an out. The bad part is the headband breaks for no reason other than just using it. Now I got a $50 piece of junk that I can't use
0	As other people have said the headphones are a bit too heavy on the ears.  After 3 weeks the crack in the headband started after 2 months the crack is so big the headphones stopped working.  I will try returning them for a replacement but I don't see why as the design just isn't very smart with the headband cracking in the only place that is under stress.  They should have reinforced that one spot.It's a shame as the sound was really top notch and I used to be able to connect them to my ipod and leave it in my bag or connect to my PC via 'bluetooth advanced audio' and not disturb my wife while I'm killing  zombies in Half-Life 2.
2	his and the white version of wireless headphone for ipod is being clearanced elsewhere for a good reason. I got one and it really cracks just by being flexed often enough which is really unavoidable no matter how careful you are. It is only a matter of time. Mine cracked within a week and yes I knew about the problem beforehand and was very careful. Unless you have a really small head (maybe the size of a softball) don't mind a cracked band or enjoy going through customer service don't get it. it looks and sounds good otherwise and works with computer bluetooth adaptors provided that you have software driver support for high quality bluetooth audio (a2dp). it's a pity.
2	i bought the wrong cable- which is my fault.  so sue me.  but don't actually sue me- i can't afford a lawyer.
0	but no data thick and stiff cable you get what you pay for keep looking for better cable reviews and pass on this
2	I must have called Verizon ten times in four months nagging them to offer the Treo 650 on their network. I almost deserted them to get the phone but in mid-June I finally got my Verizon branded Treo 650. It has not been a great experience.First the positives. It is very cool to have all my contacts all my appointments and todo items on my phone. While the phone is large by today's cell phone standards it is a great looking unit and functions well. It is easy to set up email and web access and it is great to be able to stay in touch with the normal too-much-email office when I am traveling.However it is not all great news. First I have had a heck of a time keeping the unit synchronized with my office Outlook. I get duplicates by the tons and worse deleted contacts. The dupes are somewhat tolerable to deal with but losing contacts which slip into my deleted Outlook folder is not acceptable. No one has been able to tell my why this is happening.Second the reception and volume of the phone are horrible. Where my old Motorola TC30 could get calls in awful reception areas the Treo is spotty inside my own house. I lose calls in transit and while sitting still. Worse the volume is very faint. I purchased a software tweak called VolumeCare which slightly amplifies the wimpy sound from the phone but distorts it as well. About the only acceptable solution is to use a headset and plant that sound right in your ear! Not a convenient or very affordable solution.All-in-all I'm disappointed in the Treo. It has some nice features but it is very disappointing as a phone.
0	Crap do not buy will not work with any of the phones I have paid under four dollars.  I just trashed it
2	It's okay I think this is gonna fall under the category of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. Only had to use it for a day or two because that cellphone broke.
2	this ear pec is not so good its like a prop from a old movie you no syfy star trak.
0	Just received it today from A1 Accessories.  I bought it solely to use on xbox live so I wouldn't have to keep moving my other headset that I use for work (I work at home).  My friends kept asking me to repeat myself.  One said that he had to turn down his tv volume so he could hear me (no lie).  I switched back to the other headset and I was back to crystal clarity.  After that I threw this one in the trash.. Good thing it only cost me $5 or so.
2	This is Probly a gr8 cell phone headset but when it cums 2 a work environment & business calls now could hear me! It was pretty comfortable but the earpiece was not as soft as id hoped
2	Plug this in. Sometimes it connects; sometimes it doesn't.I hear callers just fine but they ask if I am in the bathroom when I wear this.If I leave it plugged into the earphone jack of my phone it somehow manages to turn my phone off after a few minutes of non-use.I would send it back but my total cost was only $3.My phone is an older Motorola v365 and I'm sticking with to my BluetoothPlantronics 510 [Retail Packaging]. Maybe this can be an emergency backup.
2	I gave up and threw mine away when it would not work correctly on any device. Ear phones on one Mic on another. Poor Quality. I expected better from Jabra!
2	I thought that I was buying the right one and it ends up that I did but not the right size plug for the phone.
2	It will vary by individual but it didn't fit my ear. It was also in a small plastic bag so who knows where it came from. What do you expect for the price which I can't complain about.
0	This model the C250 EarWave Boom is one of 4 Jabra headsets I have ordered. I continued to try different Jabra models because the ear piece is by far the most comfortable and best sound quality I have ever used however all 4 Jabras had very poor microphone quality. With each one the persons on the other end could not hear me. Disappointed. I ended up getting the Ge Tl26593 Earset Microphone by Jasco which has been the best so far.
2	Bottom line: can't use because the volume of my voice is too low for people to easily hear.  Bought off of ebay after my c200 cord was cut.  The c200 worked well but this c250 with the longer boom mic extension was not as loud.  Jabra headsets are very comfortable and easy to wear all day.  Reasonably easy to put on with one hand once you get the hang of it.  I am not sure if my problem was unusual but these corded headsets seem to be hit or miss.  I have had other brands where the sound quality is not very good or too low.I will just reorder another c200 and take my chances with that.
2	IT works fine but it doesn't fits tu well to the ear.
2	My wife and I both purchased the BT350 on suggestion from a Verizon rep with our new phones. She got a Treo650 and I got the LG8100.Pairing the device was relatively easy once you followed the written instructions. However we've both had problems with the headset staying paired with our phones on a couple of occassions and have to run the pair-up process again.When they work the sound is pretty good. But most of the time they don't work very well at all. And for the record typicall my headset is with 3-4 feet of my phone - and I've had the same problems when it's less than 2 feet away with perfect line of sight.My wife and I almost never can call each other using our headsets and connect on the first try. Oh it will call and we'll try to answer and it will sound loud and usually clear - but one of us can't hear the other 99% of the time - at all. It's a series of hello-hello? HELLO? Forcing us to hangup and call again. Then we usually are connected.When we do connect the sound typically has some static minor digital echoing and/or frequent dropouts such that you can't hear what the other party is saying. It's very annoying - almost like when you try to fake that your getting bad reception on your cell phone an...it...sou...ds..li..is.The one button feature is ok once you figure out what the various presses on it do. I've never had to adjust the volume buttons but they are basically up and down.More annoying is the continuously strobing blue LED on the main button. When the headset is powered on the button flashes. When you are actually using the headset (connected to a call) the button flashes faster. This confuses people when you are wearing it - because it appears to them that you must be using it since it's flashing. But it's always flashing! So if you are a person who uses it a lot and doesn't take it off very often that can cause a problem.Even MORE of a problem is driving with it at night. For a week I drove home in the dark with my headset and found myself constantly turning my head to look for emergency vehicles as I kept seeing this blue strobe out of the corner of my eye. But of course when I turned my head it was gone. I finally figured out it was the reflection of my headsets indicator light reflecting off the windows! That can't be good.On the plus side - it is very lightweight and easy to wear on either ear. It comes with an AC and a USB charger - which was great since I could charge it at work or with my laptop. It seems to hold a charge very well for long periods. I know I've gone an entire week without recharging. The range seem pretty good - though I usually never get beyond a few feet from my phone.Even though I can't take this headset back I'm purchasing another one because this one is pretty much useless if the intent of it's design is to have a simple to operate hands-free and safe method of communicating with your cell phone. The BT350 simply doesn't meet any of those standards.
0	(updated)+ Good battery life+ Very comfortable (choice of two ear bud tips plus extras)+ Easy to use+ Minimal bling appeal (blue light is not obtrusive)- First unit failed (charger headset buggy) after only 3 weeks use- Jabra Support is lackluster- Ugly shiny mic piece (photo on Amazon is not accurate see customer images)After three weeks of use it stopped charging from the AC adapter. It dropped audio connections while dialing or after 20 minutes of conversation. (Replacement unit has also exhibited this but less.) Contacted Jabra about the charging issue they required that I a) return the headset under an RMA and THEN they will b) send me a new one. After less than a month of use. I found another way to get a replacement (boomerang purchase at a local chain 'tronics store.)On the plus side it lasts on standby for a few days (vice a few hours like my Sony BT headset does). It fits around my ear and comfortably in my ear very easily. The loop is soft rubber so no sharp or rigid plastic is clamping on your outer ear. If the sound is not quite loud enough (the volume controls are easy to find by touch but this in-ear speaker can only blast so much) the earbud can be gently pressed in to form a seal and is easier to hear this way. Sound is so-so some callers have told me they can't hear me if there's ambient sound music wind or cars nearby. In all better than average but this is the second Jabra product that's crapped out on me so be wary. (I recommend always owning a wired headset as a backup and particularly for business or important personal use.)** JULY 2008 UPDATE **I've now used this for 2 years and can give it a much better review. The unit has held up well (though the tip broke and had to be glued back). It still holds several hours charge where my old Sony headset now lasts one 10 minute conversation and dies. The shape weight and ergonomic fit are so unobtrusive that I've had some companions remind me I'm still wearing it after hanging up on a call. Although I didn't like the shiny bling microphone tip I've now softened on this design. The BT500 is still more attractive and less attention getting than others. Because I have a headset at work and my new car has a HandsFreeLink feature I use this unit at home and after two years it still works great. I recommend this headset without reservation. (Disclosure: I use this with a Nokia 6682 and have not tested it with other phone models.)
2	This earpiece was a great idea but the main issue with it is that it has no noise reduction and that it begins to crackle too easily when my arm or body part gets in between it and the phone. Some may say that's normal but NO--there are plenty Motorolas and Sony-Erricsons that have stronger connectivity that don't crackle as easy when obstructed so don't buy into that line.
0	I used it for less than a week and charged it 3 times. On the fourth try the green light disappeared and it wouldn't turn on.I bought this because i loved the Jabra 250 and I still use it as a matter of fact.I was just really disappointed that something like this (for the price I paid for it) would just stop working for no good reason.I should've bought the plantronics.Don't waste your money on this.
2	I bought it expecting it to be much better than the one I've had for almost two years now. Big disappointment. The static I used to get from the bt250 has not gone away especially when I have my phone in my left pocket of my pants and the headset on my right ear. Also people tell me my voice sounds remote like I am in a room.This is not acceptable. I am going back to BestBuy to return it. Why pay $120 if there's no added value?!No doubt it wraps around your ear very snug unlike the Motorola headsets but there's virtually no improvements compared to BT250.And let me guess - the next Jabra model would be BT500v for vibrate. I can tell you now - I ain't buying that one either.I guess it'll be a while before someone comes up with a headset that's not static-y but I'm willing to wait.Roumen.
0	I hate this phone...I was drawn to it by it's appearance and size but what a horrible dissapointment.  I had to get motorola mobile tools and 'hack' the volume so I could hear it - the loudest default setting is just too low. The display is impossible to see outside in bright light I detest it that it has such a poor means of displaying missed calls if the same caller has attempted to reach you multiple times it displays the last call time only. I just returned this phone for a replacement because of dust under the display screen I was told that it is a 'known' issue but that my replacement phones warranty will expire this month at the same time as the original that I purchased.
2	I bought this phone because of its sleek and stylish design. PROS and CONS:CONS: 1. The phone feels fragile and gets smudged easily. I find myself wiping off oils and finger prints constantly. Due to it's price I would recommend purchasing the extra warranty on the phone from Cingular due to the risk of damaging the phone. 2. I find that in speakerphone mode the call is almost inaudible while driving on the highway. I wish it could be louder. 3. The menu is complicated. The contacts must be entered as one entry which is annoying if you have more than one phone number for a contact. 4. The phone doesn't have a setting to disable the roaming function. 5. The phone makes a buzzing sound near electronic devices (TV computer radio etc.).PROS: 1. I have a bluetooth enabled PDA and I can transfer pictures from the PDA to the phone (and vice versa). Perfect for sharing photos or using graphics for wallpaper or picture caller ID 2. Battery life is long. 3. Video function is not that great but is nice. 4. Audio is also better than a Sanyo 8200. 5. The phone doesn't feel heavy inside the chest pocket. All in all not a bad phone. This phone is high maintenance and I don't recommend it to someone who have no patience for it's complex menus or minor shortcomings.
0	The Hype says:Getting on the Internet is easy with the RAZR V3 as it supports Cingular's GSM-based Wireless Internet Express service. When used with a Cingular data plan and the phone's Bluetooth or USB data capability the phone can be used as a wireless modem for laptops and PDAs.I say:CACA! If you plan on connecting to the internet using this phone and bluetooth you had better get a mongo battery for your laptop because it's the slowest laggiest painfully irritating useless piece of doggy doo that I have ever had the displeasure of using! You could run to Seattle and knock on Amazon's front door faster than connecting to the site.Update: 6/7/2006I tested the actual bandwidth and I connect at 39.1 kbps that's slower than dialup with a 56k (53.3) modem. When connected to Cingular's GSM it says connected at 115.2 kbps when I connect via bluetooth and 230 kbps when I use the USB cable. Either way the actual speed is 39-41 kbps and I surely don't have the patience for that.One last annoying feature ... Cingular brands their phones so you can't download games to your phone or delete certain ringtones etc. as you can with other providers. There is also an annoying HELLOMOTO video/commercial that uses 25% of your available space for videos of your own. There is no way to delete this and recapture this waste of space. This truly is about the worst product I have ever purchased.
0	Like the previous Motorola phones that I've had this one has the easy intutive system for navigating its numerous menus --- I'm sold on using Motorola for this reason  compared to the Noxxxx Motorola is great!PROS:Almost everythingAwesome designGSMI found the volume to be excellent compared to my last phone (motorola v60).Good antenna extremely low rate of dropped signals --- also since the antenna does not protrude I anticipate it will not require replacement (I had to replace the antenna twice on my old v60 --- broke off from carrying in pocket and/or dropping)Excellent color screen.Good camera for a phone.Great size easily fits in a shirt pocket.Great battery life (with Bluetooth off)Easily customizable but items that I never use (media mall media net etc.) remain in a prominent place and can not be put in some obscure location.CONS:The most significant negative feature is the screen --- it is extremely hard to see in sunlight.Display on front (when closed) is hard to read.Price (if you are upgrading your phone with Cingular --- they wanted $199) However since I was changing from AT&T; to Cingular I was able to buy the phone at BestBuy for $70.The manual that comes with it should be better writen.Screen gets oily from normal use and must be wiped off frequently.Alarm Clock interface could be better.Date Book Alert is not very loud.Accessory support at Cingular Stores rather poor --- two Cingular Stores did not have the USB cable (had to buy one at Wal-Mart).Of the four or five phones that I have owned this one is by far the best in all respects.  Even with these cons it is still eons ahead of other phones.EDIT: Change from 5 stars to 1 star...  I loved the features on the phone and the flip lid was great.  PROBLEM:  After about 3 months the screen would not light up --- took the phone back to AT&T; and they sent me a reconditioned phone which lasted about a month --- took that one back they sent another reconditioned phone  Long story > short:  I had 5 phones in one year the 5th phone finally worked and kept working for a couple of years.  Because of my experience with this phone I will not buy another Motorola.
2	10 years into the cell phone revolution the phones have gotten smaller lighter with great features but what's the point when you can't carry on a conversation? I have found Cingular to be by far the worst in terms of dropped calls in the SF Bay Area. I suffered thru AT&T and their conversion to GSM and Cingular is not any better than that service no matter what they promise. Cingular also has very consumer unfriendly 2 yr. contracts that you will be paying on long after that shiny phone has lost its lustre. They are constantly changing their rollover minute plans to screw you out of your minutes. When i downgraded from a higher national plan to a lower national plan they took away all the minutes I aquired in a year. In other words maximize the revenue - minimize the service is their motto.  I could live with this if i could make a decent phone call - i can't believe there are so many dead areas in a place with 13 million people.
2	I ordered a cell phone from Amazon the Motorola V3. When I checked my account the next day a weird message told me that I was not approved and instructed me to cancel my order. I was puzzled but did as directed. Later that day I went and got a great deal on a free phone from my local membership warehouse store.Later in the day I was checking my e-mail and found one from Amazon. It explains that sometimes cell phone approval is slow and included the following:Until this is resolved it is possible that the information in theYour Account section of the Amazon site will incorrectly indicate thatthis order requires your attention and may direct you to cancel - pleasedisregard this until we get more information.WHAT???!!!They tell me to cancel the order knowing that this is incorrect???Well I followed their screwy directions and they lost an order and alot of goodwill on my part.Amazon has been successful they must know what they are doing but this kind of behavior makes you wonder...To new cell buyers BEWARE the incorrect message.
2	The Motorola RAZR V3 is worst cell phone I have ever had.  The only nice feature is the camera and there are a lot of other cell phones with better features that have cameras too.  Also beware of the so-called rebate.  If you don't mind jumping through 50 million hoops to get it well go for it but if your time is money run from this rebate and this phone.  5 co-workers in my office thought we would take advantage of this offer and what we thought would be a cool hip cell phone.  How wrong we all were.  Cingular is fine.  They have their issues like all the cell companies now for customer service but it is the phone itself & the rebate program that was an issue for ALL 6 of us.  3 people had problems with the buttons on the phone and had to send them back before they even got their rebates.  The acutual rebate thats up to 4 months to receive and that is only if you have correctly jumped through all of the hoops.  One mistake and you are screwed out of the $150 rebate.Another problem with the phone and it's limited features is that other than the initial tone that you have a message there is no way to know that you have a message waiting unless you pick up the phone and look.  All my older model cell phones featured a tone and/or a light on the outside of the phone to let you know that you had a message.I have never written a review before on Amazon or otherwise but I feel that people should be aware that the cool hip advertising of the RAZR is not what it is cracked up to be.
0	This cable is ultra thin and must not be shielded well.  If I can't find the perfect spot to put my Ipod within the 2 foot circumference of the cable - then I get a ton of interference.  Even when I can find a good spot there is still some interference occasionally.  I have another cable (non-retractable) that is only a foot long that works just fine - so I know the interference has something to do with this cable.
2	This is fine for what I use it for.  It is exactly as described. I plug my phone into my car radio and it works just fine. Plain and simple
2	I wanted to keep my car free and clear of cables so I purchased a retractable cable to at least keep it more organized. The retractable part works fine but the cable is pretty thin. I hooked it up to my stereo and I could here a lot of static. I then tried a not retractable cable that was pretty thick and the static was gone and the sound was a lot better. You have to sacrifice sound for clutter free cables or go with sound and have wires all over. I stopped using this since I couldn't stand the static. I am not sure if its the cable I got or not but I will stick to the non retractable cable. I'll just have to find a short one since the 3 foot one I have is too long.
2	This item is not bad but the retractable cord is too short. Otherwise It is easy to carry around and serves its purpose
0	UPDATE:this silly 3.5mm cord lasted all of 3 months audio went out and the retractor went out very cheap quality would not buy this again went with the old standard non retractable cord
2	I bought this in hopes that it would help keep the cord situation under control in my car.  However after only two short months the cord shorted out.  I ended up buying a different one.
2	not sure what issue is here.  but I put one in my wifes BMW 335 Ci convertible and it makes a horrible background noise.  That was not there before.I put in my Buick Enclave and it works flawlessly.Not sure where the interference is coming from.
2	I picked up one of these specifically for its ability to retract; it's quite fragile and flimsy though and within two days it had broken and no longer retracts. It's fine as a cable so far but now it has a heavy middle which means if I drop it easily as I'm trying to plug it in and have to go hunting for it between the seats.
2	This is a male to male patch 3.5mm cable - ostensibly to connect anything with an earphone jack to anything with a headphone input.  The reason to buy this is the retracting mechanism but that mechanism gets tangled sometimes.  You have to pull both ends out evenly (with the center part staying in the middle of the span).  You cannot pull from one side only - it will get tangled and jam.
2	It rolls up nice but has a hissing sound in the background. In the dead spot between two songs you can hear the hissing. It isnt all that loud but its there. Still works well enough that I didnt want to return it.
2	It does tear up way too easy. This is my 3rd one. I've tried others and find I go back to it. Problems that have occured: The input jacks bend short in the cords and failure to retract as designed. While its a great design some thing needs to be done so it can stand up to the real world.
0	First of all when I ordered this item the image showed it was WHITE not black. I ordered this specifically to match my white iPhone. Not only that the thing fell apart as I was taking it out of the box. I will be returning this garbage and getting my $5.00 back. Last time I ever purchase a Scosche product!
2	This worked for about a week before it stopped staying put when you pulled both ends out. It kept retracting ad then finally just broke. Its a great idea but this one sucks!
2	Cheap in price and quality. Mine broke after a couple months of use. The sound started going in and out. It was cheap enough I wasn't really upset. Next time I might just buy a couple so I don't have to wait for the replacement to come.
2	I have used this cable on and off for about a year and a half -- but there were at least six months in the middle there where I had misplaced it and didn't use it at all. It recently went bad -- lost one of the stereo channels. It now connects one channel only.The problem is in the contacts. If I bend the cable near one of the ends I can get the other channel to come in intermittently. Note that I didn't ever fiddle with the ends during normal use. I have only tried the bending game to get the lost channel to come in.If you think the price is worth about 1 year of use this is the cable you want to get. It certainly is convenient and I like the retractable feature a lot. Just wish it would have lasted longer.
0	Seller lost this package at their facility and it took 2 months to receive it.  I bought it as a gift and i'm glad it took too long to get here. it's flimsy and gets really tangled really easy.  avoid at all costs.
2	I decided to return this product the moment I took it out of the box. It's cheaply made. My decision was cemented when it stopped working after one day of use.
2	This was used about four times before it stopped working it was the car side with the issue and other chargers did work in this lighter so really not worth it.
2	It lasted me 2 days then it didnt charge I thought it was my battery but no it was the charger
2	The case loosened over time and slides up on the phone which makes it hard to hear conversations.  I like the way it looks and protects the phone but sometime it's not worth having the case on it.  It's okay but next time I'll get a more flexible case
2	This earpiece worked well for me.  It had good range and sound quality and the hands free activation was very useful. One huge design flaw as I see it however was the on/off button.  To turn on/off the device you have to hold down the button.  After only a few months of use the button began to malfunction and over time the button totally stopped working. I purchased the device in November and by March the button had stopped working at all.  Since this is the same button that you have to push to answer a call disconnect a call or activate voice recognition when the button stopped working the device became pretty useless.
2	It's ok but doesn't have enough range connection with the phone. If I walk a few feet away you get a lot of static. It's only good if you keep the phone right by the headset. It's great when driving in the car but not for walking around the house. I guess my advice is keep your phone in your pocket. All-in-all it's good for the price.
2	I'm really unimpressed with this headset. Granted its a pretty old design now (i bought it in 2006) and I imagine there are much better headsets out there.There is way too much static for such a simple digital device. It is especially bad if I have my phone in the opposite-side pocket as which ear I have the headset in.Certainly you can do better than this by now. Get something with a later bluetooth version.
2	I read the reviews here and ended up buying this bluetooth device. After pairing it up with my phone I ended up using while my phone was clipped to my belt. I got static even if I move my phone I get static. I need to have the phone in front of me before I can use this bluetooth and not get static. Other than the static it's a nice bluetooth.
0	I bought the Plantronics 320 today. As soon as I walked out the storethe reception went static beyond belief. The salesman said Give it a chance I have and it's going back tomorrow. For the past week  I've bought 4 headsets(Motorola 500850700& this one which is one of the worst.I found the Motorola 700 to be the best so far.  Clear reception most of the timeexcellent volume(no problem hearing while driving)& it always connected to my treo 650.  On a windy day my friend on the other end didn't even know I got out the carhardly any background noise.  I just ordered the 700 through Amazonmuch cheaper than Cingular & Motorola.
2	I really wanted this headset to work out because it is being sold at such a good price relative to most others.  Well it prooved to me that you often get what you pay for.  Let's consider the following in why I am returning this headset: pairing sound quality ease of use and comfort.Pairing - this really belongs with ease of use but it is really your first experience with a headset other than charging it.  It was hard to figure out if I was holding the multifunction button down long enough to get the headset in paring mode.  After 4 attempts I got it right.  My LG VX-9800(see my review)was able to pair with it easily after this.  However it shouldn't take 4 attempts just to get a headset into pairing mode.Sound Quality - this is actually the area where the headset does the best in my opinion.  With the speaker resting inside my ear I didn't have to have the volume turned all the way up in order to hear the people I called.  My wife reported that she could hear me clearly with one exception.  When I had the AC fan speed in my car set to 3 (out of 4) she said that it sounded like I was in a wind tunnel.  Kicking the AC down to 2 fixed the problem but once we hit the Texas summer that could be a problem.Ease of Use - I think that Plantronics' attempt to make this headset easy to use backfired.  I would go to turn on the headset but I would always have to check my phone to see if it was connected.  Initiating voice commands also required multiple attempts before I would hear the familiar Please say a command from my phone.  However what really drove me nuts was trying to turn it off.  I would hold down the multifunction button for what I thought was the amount of time specified in the instructions but I kept getting Please say a command.  Compare this to the Motorola HS850(see my review) where on/off is controlled by the folding boom while the multifunction button simply handles pairing voice commands and call connecting.  I consider my self to have technology savvy and able to fight through things to make them work but this headset *still* frustrated me.  If you like things to work simply this headset isn't for you.Comfort - I was willing to put up with the flaky operation of the headset because of the cost; however I realized after two days that I was not going to be able to stand to wear it for any extended period of time.  The speaker pipes its volume into a rather hard earpiece that fits inside your ear.  It is not removable and try as I might to adjust it I could not find a comfortable position.  The ear hook is also fairly rigid.  These two things combined made for an unpleasant comfort experience.I have to consider this headset to be a failure.  On the box it touts Comfort and Ease of Use.  As you can see from my results it doesn't deliver on either of these.  It's a shame because it does deliver good sound quality at a reasonable price.  Unless you have the ear it was modeled after though I would not buy it.
2	Of the 8 headsets I've tested this one is about average. The sound quality is slightly muffled. No worse than most of the ones I've tried but definitely not as good as my favorite the Plantronics Voyager 510. If you've got a noisy environment this one probably won't satisfy. I liked the single button function and found it worked great with only a rare glitch when the headset would partially connect to the phone resulting in me being able to hear through the headset but needing to speak through the phone. (Turn off the headset and turn it back on. No need to end the call.) My partner and I both used one of these hard core for over a year in a construction environment until I broke the ear loop on mine and moved on to the 510. Considering what we put them through I have to say that this unit holds up. I compare headsets by pairing two of them putting one in each ear and switching between them while on the same call. This lets me and the caller hear the difference. All in all good price easy to use sturdy and most people won't notice the sound quality.
0	If this unit looks big in the photo brace yourself: it's like a bad science fiction rocket ship when it arrives.  It is made of hard plastic with odd fins and protrusions everywhere.  It does not rest easily on the head.  It feels heavy and abrasive.  I am surprised that none of these manufacturers have come up with a softer lighter material or spent any time considering how to fit a headset to the ears and head.  Sony does a better job with its DRBT21G/B but also falls victim to hard plastic and a hinge in the middle of the set that digs at your skull as time goes on.  Truly astonishing.I could not get the unit to pair with my top-of-the-line Sony bluetooth transmitter.  Motorola was kind enough to issue a stern warning about returning this item without calling their toll-free number.  What a waste of time.  They either don't answer the hone or leave you hanging for long periods of time on hold.
2	Never got a chance to try it because you need all the Bluetooth things on your audio devices and TV. I am sure if I know a TV that comes with Bluetooth so you have to buy the transmiter before you can use it.Anyway the headphone fit *snugly* on my neck. And it is uncomfortable. So back in the box and back to Amazon.
2	Using it with my Blacberry 8310 it works fine full sterio since the bb handles that.  The only problem  The T820 does not want always pair. First device I have that does this. It will pair but forgets to include the sterio service transport ( kinda of important).  then it works.  The phones fit snugg but a bit tight.  I have a  Giant head so maybe it is a bit much for me but they seem durable
2	A great headset - if used in a quiet environment. At the above price it's a bit expensive but an excellent value. It should have come with a USB charger adapter included; instead this is supposedly available as an add-on accessory yet can't be found for sale anywhere. My report card:Design: A- very simple and lightweight design. Buttons are few and usable after some practice. Comes with 4 different adapters for OEM phone chargers which is a novel yet cumbersome approach. Includes additional accessories for a more custom fit. Carrying pocket doubles as charging station; headset fits dangerously loosely inside and the pocket itself doesn't clip securely onto shirt pockets or belts. An aluminum carrying case is provided to keep everything together.Aesthetics: A- it's a tiny and stylish piece.Build quality: B+ the materials look more solid than they are. Construction is fair.Comfort: A+ the most comfortable and stable headset ever. Multiple ear gels aid in attaining a custom fit that is quite secure. An earhook is also provided for added stability but probably won't be needed.Compatibility: A no problems pairing or using this headset. Full handsfree functionality is available but controls differ greatly for different functions and take some learning.Outbound sound quality: B+ callers can hear me great along with any other noises in the environment. Lack of noise cancellation makes this headset worthless in for example a crowded room. No echo whatsoever though.Inbound sound quality: B volume is beyond plentiful. Inbound voices are rich in bass but *completely* lack crispness. Frequent static regardless of range or line-of-sight.
2	I like the in the ear approach. It's extremely comfortable. You have several options as far as finding a comfortable fit. It comes with a portable charger which is a prelude to things to come.I could hear any caller without problems but in noisy environments they couldn't hear me. In a quite environment it worked very well. The battery is terrible. Their listing is up to 3 hours. There's no way you can get that much talk time out of this. I heard allot of static. I couldn't wear my phone in the holster because of that.I'm a frequent business traveler and it doesn't work well for my needs. However it does have some positive traits. The main two problems are extraneous noise problem and poor battery life. So if you're not in a loud area or heavy user it's a great headset.
2	After reading the stellar reviews for the Discovery 640 both on Amazon and Cnet I bought one and took off for home. After charging it up and attempting sync with my Motorola v360 I found I couldn't get it to work. I re-read the manuals for the 640 and for my v360 to see if it was me. Then I went on the web to see if I had some compatibility issue. It then occurred to me that I might have actually gotten a bad piece of electronics - which is a pretty rare occurrence nowadays. I was able to cross check the Discovery and my phone with a friend's bluetooth headset (Moto HS820 and v600) and found that the Plantronics was the culprit.Bottom line: check before you get too far from the store. Since it is usually a hassle to return items via mail order i would only buy from a brick and mortar store.Here is a tidbit you might want to know about bluetooth chips (ICs) - they are not always fully tested! I am directly involved in the semiconductor testing industry and have been for many years. Bluetooth chips and many other relatively low cost consumer semiconductor devices are NOT fully tested. Instead the lots of devices are sample tested to statistically insure that a very high percentage are good. This is in direct contrast to higher value chips such as Intel AMD and PPC microprocessors that are much more fully tested at multiple steps. The low cost nature of bluetooth chips (as well as many mp3 802.11 etc.) really mandates the sampled test approach. For the most part we get away with it. In the case of the unit I bought it was not sufficient. The fact that I got a defective finished headset means that it is unlikely that Plantronics does 100% testing of its finished headset in addition to the known fact that the IC manufacturer they use is unlikely to do 100% testing. Once again check it before you leave the parking lot.I will try one of these again as soon as they are back in stock and report on it again if I get a functional unit.
0	I just got this from Amazon. I have a Treo700wx(sprint) and set up was a breeze and comfort of earpiece is excellent. However I keep losing the connection between the 640 Headset and Treo. The Headset beeps in my ear everytime the connection is lost and it happens often.  I double checked the connection and everything is set up per the instructions.  Just wondering if I have a defective unit or if there is anyone else experiencing the same problems.
2	Fits my Galaxy Note 3 but just doesn't want to stay on the window...keeps falling off.  Not much good if it keeps falling off.
2	Using it with the Nokia N97 the left mount side covers de unlock botton and the right mount side presses the camara botton. After installing an unlock application the issue with the ulock botton got solved. To solve the camara problem some foam material had to be cut out.Update 27.05.2011 - Works great with iPhone 3GS even in protective leather casing.
2	This would be great product if it lived up to its specs.Pros:1.comfortable2.ease of use3.fantastic sound quality on both ends.Cons:1. Battery doesn't hold a charge2. 12V adapter seems to cook the battery.3. has a habit of dropping connection(I think this common to all BT devices)I'm currently on my second Road Warrior headset. The first one became extremely hot when charged with the 12V adapter plug & wouldn't hold a charge for over a few hours. I suspect that the truck voltage(14.1V) is too much for this little battery. I haven't tried the auxiliary truck plug on this one as I don't want to fry the battery. The AC power brick has a rated output of 9V so I suspect the 5V difference is what does in the battery. This one I have only used the AC adapter & the battery life is at best abysmal. The info supplied claims a standby life of up to 100 hours & talk time of up to 6 hours. Not even close. Yesterday my unit ran 6 hours standby & 1 hour talk before it had to be recharged. If this unit lived up to it hype I would give it 5 stars but with its poor battery life I only give it 2. If you can live with the battery issues its a great unit.
0	Well I have no idea what these sound like. They wont work on my phone! The connector is made ONLY for a Ericsson phone which was NOT stated anywhere on the description. They were however cheap so I really cant complain too much.
0	I'm on my third z520a in the six months I've owned it.  The only reason I haven't gone through more is that I've accepted this phone is a lemon.  The phone freezes and can't be shut off requiring removal of the battery to reset frequently drops calls doesn't always let me place calls and just plain does weird things that result in an unreliable and frustrating call experience.  What is even more annoying is that I purchased expensive model-specific accessories that will become useless paperweights when I replace this with a new phone - a phone I will be out additional hundreds on not to mention the cost of accessories.  I'll never buy another Sony Ericsson product.
0	The design is good and it would be an excellent product if the quality was anything more than terrible. The buttons to extend the arms worked exactly one time before breaking. Now I press and press and nothing happens. It's a shame because the rest of it works decently.The suction cup holds well and the tube coming from the cup is pretty sturdy. It moves a lot when the car is moving so you would need to rest it on the dash which would help somewhat but not perfectly.Overall one star only because with the poor quality it is worthless in spite of the few good points.
2	I bought this item along with one by Kensington. The Kensington cradle did not accommodate my HTC Rezound cell with the extended battery. I kept both and am using the cradle from this product with the Kensington Mount. IMPORTANT NOTE: The gooseneck tube on this item SEEMS like it is solid and NON adjustable. It IS adjustable. It just takes quite a bit of force to do it which is good!  The Kensington one also does bend. I  consider this to be quite a bargain.
2	The Goose neck is too hard to bend to shape and it doesn't stay put on the windshield very well either. I donated it to a local thrift store because it would have cost more to ship it back than the refund was worth.
2	Great idea and design not great execution and materials.It works good but once mounted almost impossible to adjust-out the sides with the ratcheting mechanism. You sort of have to tilt it backwards to make the ratchet action work. When mounted you can't tilt it so it's a real hassle to open.I have mine set and I just wedge the phone into it when I want to use it.I primarily use it when driving through New York city to use my phone as a dash-cam. Eventually I'd like to get video of the people that walk into my car or cyclists that ride into it... It's great for that.It's obvious the plastic or construction material allows it to fall out of tolerance which means the ratchet action ceases to function. It's a crapshoot when you build a complex mechanism out of parts that break or wear easy or aren't built to spec in the first place.
0	It even seemed flimsy at first and got stuck while we were trying to figure out how it worked. We did get it unstuck and we thought the problem was solved but we were wrong.After using it for only a couple days it completely stuck and is no longer functional.  Pretty upset as my husband really wanted this for his work vehicle and now we have to go searching for another one and hopefully don't run into the same problem.
2	I keep ordering these because there's nothing better for the price but eventually the foam &#34;fingers&#34; that grab the phone will break off from being squeezed.  Just the nature of the beast I suppose.
0	I only purchased this phone because Cingular did not carry the new RAZR with the MP3 player and 1.3 megapizel camera so I had to settle for this one.  The swivel to use the keypad is awful no one can ever hear me when talking (even when I use the Motorola H700 Bluetooth headset) photos taken on a regular megapixel camera phone are better than the 1.3 provided here can't listen to MP3 thru bluetooth photos stored on phone often become corrupted for no reason at all all photos disappear occassionally and I have to turn phone off and back on too bulky and heavy battery at times drains after only an hour even without any use reception very poor and often have to stand in wide open areas.  Overall I am very disappointed with this phone and only wish my contract would allow me to trade it in.  I am a gadget junkie and the reviews on CNET led me to purchase this phone but I truly now regret it.  Go with the new Motorola RAZR with the 1.3 camera and the MP3 player same features in a nice slim package.
0	Everything works fine but it can only sustain less than two days for very lightweight use (most of the time in standby status)I ordered two sony ericsson w600i from wirefly they are bundled with cingular family share plan. Both phone are locked to cingular.Talked with sony ericsson support service sony doubted it may be the problem of battery or phone and both of them.Talked with wirefly they decided to exchange.
0	Case was garbage. What I got was not whats pictured. Also nothing lined up. Sent back promply. Would not purchase again.
2	Good Item..On Time delivery..Had a bit getting use to plug insert for power cord  worked it out.Great Price and neat
0	Watch out people -- the notched circular connection on these ear cushions does not fit the opening on a Plantronic Voyager Pro -- the diameter is too small and they fall out. However I ordered the medium gel eartipsPlantronics Medium Eartips for Voyager Pro [3 Pack] pack of 3 and the connector on those does fit. So I'm keeping the gel eartips (not this item) and throwing out these foam ones.
2	It lasted for less than a year and I always had trouble hearing people.  It never sat well on my ear no matter how I adjusted it.  Luckily it was less than $20 so no big loss.  I was disappointed because I expected better from Motorola. The volume control was awful. It never seemed to make much of a difference.  I wouldn't recommend it at all.
2	Bought this as a surprise for my girlfriend she used my Motorola H800 slider headset & commented how it would be nice to have one so she could talk & not have the hold the phone.  She loves it & it does everything she needs it to do & I saved about $20-$25 off store prices so it was great for both of us.  If you or your girfriend/wife are looking for an inexpensive bluetooth headset go with this one good little headset at a good price.
2	I bought this for my wife for christmas and i am disapointed in the voice quality.  When she is in the car talking to me on it I can barely hear her because of the car noise and even with her having the radio on low it is still annoying to hear everything in the background.  For the almost $50 price tag i thought it would be better quality since it was the step up from the entry level bluetooth.  I also havent found how to put it on the left ear yet i feel like i am going to break it if i try to pull the ear loop off.I would recommend spending another $40 and buying the Jawbone bluetooth.  I got one as a present and it works great and fits better on my ear.  I drastically reduces background noise.Overall I am not impressed by motorola and thought they would make a better bluetooth for this price.
2	The weight is nice and balance on the year is good.  The features are good but one must remember certain button combinations for extended features (like press two buttons at the same time to mute the microphone).  The battery life is good.  A significant issue is that it picks up surrounding noise better than the person's voice who is taking which means that it often can't be used.  If you don't drive a very quiet car like a BMW or Mercedes then users may complain that they can't hear you and ask you to pick up the phone.
2	This item did not fit easily on the ear.  Earbud not designed properly.  I would not recommend this product. Also too bulky.
0	I have no idea what they mean by Motorola Retail Packaging but beware it is not the same as the picture on the website.  I received this headset loose in a plastic bag along with the instructions and the charger.  The charger had been ripped out of it's bag and used (the cord had obviously been re-wrapped and secured with a grocery store bag tie).When I complained to Amazon about receiving used merchandise they immediately sent a replacement via overnight but the customer service person could have cared a less as to why Amazon is selling used/returned merchandise.I just received the replacement today. While it doesn't look used it too is just in a plastic baggie - no packaging like the webite shows.  I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife (to go with her pink Razr) - I'm sure she is going to be very impressed with the plastic baggie packaging.  I sure hope it works better than it looks!  Really bad Amazon really bad.
2	I purchased this bluetooth as a gift for a family member's Sony Ericsson cell phone.  We had to play around with it at first to get it working properly.  She still has minor issues with the headset but overall she likes it.We decided not to return the headset because I did pair it with my iPhone 3G after three attempts without using the passcode.  I was able to use most features easily with clear reception.  So the earpiece isn't defective.  The price was to good as well.Buyer beware and do the research on the pairing capibilities with your electronic device and this bluetooth.
2	The price of bluetooth devices has gone down dramatically that I was able to justify buying one:) The H500 works fine with our LG Shine. Although you may need to talk a little louder so that the other person can clearly understand you (Well not too bad really).It was an easy setup. The device itself looks fine not too dorky in my opinion. It also has a nice blue LED light. Available in many colors of choice.Why 3 stars? The volume control is hardly palpable. It is hard to adjust the volume while in use. Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust. Even the call button is difficult to press.I like the ear hook can be flipped to be used either on your left or right ear. It is also not too heavy to be worn comfortable on your ear.
2	It is easy to use and set up but quickly went out of style. The pink coloring is very feminine and nice and the blue light button is easy to use.
2	I ordered the H700 after reading a number of good reviews. I got it from Circuit City so it's not a 'counterfeit'.  It pairs well with my Moto Q9C and it is very comfortable- but thats the end of the good things I can say about it. The volume is too low for me to hear callers if there is any ambient noise and the static which happens sporadically *usually when I'm on an important call makes this virtually unusable.  I guess I will RMA and see if this one is a dud and the replacment is any better.
2	I use this unit with my Palm Treo 700w which has a pretty lousy BT radio so that may explain part of the reason why the range is so awful with this headset.  Max range with clear line of sight is about 6 feet but usually less then 24 inches.  It is barely usable if the phone is on my waist in its holster.  Major disappointment.  My Jabra BT250 is better with the Treo but not hugely so.My biggest problem with this headset is that people are constantly telling me that they can't hear me.  I have to lift the mic boom away from my cheek and then they will say Ah! Much better!.  When that is only the case while I stand there like a dork with one hand holding the mic boom away from my cheek and the other hand holding the phone within a foot of my head.  This looks pretty silly walking down an airport terminal and rather defeats the purpose of having a headset in the first place...I'll say this though - the H700 performs the feature that I was looking for which was so bad with the Jabra BT250 - it actually stays on my ear.  I have small ear lobes and the Jabra won't stay put - if I lean down it falls off.  The H700 stays on very well and you hardly notice it is even there.  Very comfortable!Too bad the mic gets blocked by my cheek which makes it worthless about 50% of the time.**Update 5/11/2006**- solution to muffled sound problem...I trimmed a tiny piece of adhesive-backed felt (the kind you put under bowls/vases etc. you will have on your coffee table)and placed it on the little gray bump on the boom just behind the tiny mic opening. This creates an air gap between the mic opening and your cheek - problem solved!A great headset with pretty good reception and wonderful form factor. 5 stars if they fix the mic hole clearance problem!
2	I've had my H700 for almost a year now and not until recently did I learn it was a FAKE!  WOAH!  After reading the PDF on this page about how to spot a fake I quickly learned the one I picked up on eBay was a fake.However the headset has worked VERY well.  I compared it to a bluespoon AX7 in-ear headset and I ended up keeping my fake H700.  Overall it has been a very good copy although not the real thing.  Very reliable.  However I am still disappointed that I did not get the real headset.Is there anything I can do about this?
2	I switched ot this model from a Jabra 47D.  The Motorola was much easier to disengage from the phone simply by closing it.  Also the Motorola stays on the ear more securely.  The only drawback that I can see to this model is the sound quality is not as good as the Jabra.
0	I threw it out because of terrible Volume/clarity on both ends.  Go for the Scala 500- I just bought my second (lost my first) and it's the best on the market.
2	I have a LG CU 500 and the phone did not have a problem in recognizing the cell phone.  However I have a problem with the mic as it picks up EVERYY sound in the background.  If you are in a quiet room the phone is great.  However if you are in a mall or at the check out counter you hear the background noises better than you hear the person on the phone!
2	I bought this several days ago it is easy to use.After 2 days I can not turn volumn up and the sound is so low and I can not hear it when I am driving (I have a lexus new car it is quiet). or I did not operate correctly but I follow the instruction in the manual.Anyone has such experience please let us know.ThanksSumulu
2	The H700 some love it some hate it. Wherever you fall a lot of people are talking about it.PRO's /  CON'sIt is comfortable and light. / Depending on the size of your face your cheek may block the microphone resulting in muffled sound.If you are a lady with long hair that falls over your ear it will get caught in the boom microphone and snagged by the rubber tip as you flip the boom open and closed to answer calls.Distance is quoted as  up to 30 feet / Some phone combinations have distance issues if the headset and phone are not on the same side of your body.Pairs well with my Motorola Razr V3 and Cingular 8125. / Other phones and PDA's have problems SO your mileage may vary.The controls are small multifunction (each button does may things) and are easy to access but hey they are on the side of your head.Microphone is Very sensitive / People have complained about wind noise echoes in rooms and Who else is in the car with you ?Headset volume is loud louder than most / Its adjustable so this is a good thing.The headset lights up in four different colors to show various status (charging pairing standby etc) / You can turn off the flashing blue 'I am using a fancy headset dork lamp' but it will come back on after the headset is turned off and on again.A note a caution1. This is a young product and the complaints and returns have resulted in two versions (Version A and Version B) of this headset in the market.  Version B fixes a number of problems that version A had with certain phones.2. Distance is POOR compare to other headsets and even other Motorola Bluetooth products.  I have changed my headset and Cingular has replaced the phones (Razr V3 and 8125) twice with no improvement. Distance is less than 10 feet with Static and dropped calls.  Do not expect to leave your phone in the car and pump gas or get the mail without complaints.  Some folks with the Verizon V3C Razr have reported getting better distance but few past 10 feet without the call degrading or dropping.SUPPORT3. Motorola gives you 30 days to try and return with refund However the return shipping is ON YOU.  So with shipping / tracking / insurance expect to spend another $5 even if its their problem. If its longer than 30 days you are stuck with it.UPDATE 6/1/06Product was returned as defective and received by Motorola 6/15. A new one was to go out 2 day FedEx. 22 Days later I received it today 7/7 NOT NEW just a refurbished headset. NO charger manual case or  warranty card.UPDATE 11/18/06Died again. Will not pair make or answer a call. Motorola will not send a replacement until old one is received.  No free-shipping this time.BOTTOM LINEGoogle Motorola H700 problems make an informed decision. If you can try before you buy.I would give it 5 stars for Style 3 stars for execution 2 stars for how well it works and 1 star for their support policy.
2	I really wanted this to work.  It's a great design and it's easy to use and set up.  Sound quality listening is great.  Sound quality speaking for others to hear was unacceptable.  This could be because of the way it fits me since this seems to work well for many others.  If you try this out however it's very important to check that others actually hear you well and not as in my experience too loudly and with too much low end on the sound quality.  I'm returning it.
2	I had the 850 and thought that it was decent but could be better so I bought the 700. Let me just say that I own the Motorola V330 and from reading the other reviews it seems that this headset works best with the razr. That being said it does not work well with the v330. If you move more than 4 feet away from your phone you get a ton of static. People tell me that I sound muffled when I'm talking to them. My advice is to only get this if you have the razr otherwise forget it.
2	When it comes to headsets the sound quality is the bottom line for me. I'm sorry to say that this one doesn't have it. I found the function excellent and especially liked the folding boom mike. I find it easier to use the folding boom to turn it on/off when dropping it in a pocket rather than using a button like on most other models. The big issue for me was the muffled sound both for me and the caller. The other problem is that in a noisy environment holding a conversation became a real problem. I have tested 8 different headsets by pairing two of them at a time putting one in each ear and switching between them during a call. This lets me and the caller make a reasonable comparison of sound quality. Only one of the other 7 I tested did worse. (I also tested the Motorola HS850 and found it to have the same pros and cons as this one.)
2	Love the battery life look and size but have found the sound inferior to my  bottom-of-the-line HS 805.  Frequent static.And then the topper--whenever it is on the blue light on the side blinks.  The instructions say that this stops after five minutes or that it can be disabled by holding the two volume buttons.  Both are lies.  Maybe some twenty-something year old designer thought it was way cool to walk around with a big blinking LED on the side of your head but I can't use this in a business setting.  It's going back.
2	It's didn't work for me r my phone its as a lot of mess on it I think this seller shouldn't have any more item on the best website I think
2	This is a replacement for a prior Motorola bluetooth headset of very similar design. I was quite pleased with the old one until after about 2 years when it just died. That was 2 years of daily service so not an issue. But this new one has issues holding pairing with a Blackberry 8700G and has significant voice static unless the Blackberry is on the same side of my body as the headset and not in the holster. The old one didn't have that problem.On the positive side the USB mini charger saves me one more power adaptor when traveling which is a good thing. They should all have that feature.
2	The electronic parts worked fine; it sync'd fine and sounded alright. I just didn't like the way it fit on my ear.  It didn't feel stable or secure. I have the same problem with my headset with a similar ear pattern at work.
2	I hear lots of static even before making a call.  I have Motorola H500 too and that headset has no static with my phone (Verizon LG VX8300).  This H700 has LOTS of static.  Called Motorola tech support and their best solution is to return and replace it.  As far as usability goes this a great headset over the ear is more comfortable than in ear and the fit is perfect - nice and snug.  I'd keep it without any doubt if it wasn't for static noise.  While I hear static people on the other phone can hear me fine just as good as when I'm using H500.
2	However I just did not enjoy the size of this behind the ear unit found it to be too big. It is a little difficult at first learning how to slip this around your ear but after awhile it works out ok. Please note that you do not get to use your selected ring tone it automaticly (Motorola hand set) defaults to its standard ring while the blue tooth is actively connected. You can turn the ear piece off then power on to answer in order to keep your fav ring tone. All in all it works very well sound and loundness were very good. However I just did not like the size of this unit. It is quite bulky.EDITJust picked up a HS850 now that is more to my liking however I hope there will be no issues of a broken wire in the flip boom as the reviewer above mentioned.
2	When I got it I was a little scared. It was my 1st bluetooth and it looked like something straight out of Star Trek. You have to be a little careful with the twisting earpiece since it's in a sliding ball inside and can slip out of the groove very easily if you change ears too much(which mine did on day three). The range is not as far as you would like it to be but boy can it hold a charge. It'll outlast your cellphone battery everytime! And the fit was pretty comfy behind the ear. The buttons are also very easy to use. Remember to speak up though...people tend to have a problem hearing you as well as you will be hearing them.
0	It got a lot of static noise. The connection was not good either. You have to put your phone within 6 inches away from the ear piece to get better reception. Regret for buying it. One useless item and money go down the drain.
2	I love the size form factor and usability of this headset.  Incoming sound is good.  Unfortunately the outgoing sound is a deal breaker.  If there is any background noise this headset will pick it up and transmit it just as loud as your voice.  The DSP helps a little but affects the sound quality dramatically (think overcompressed MP3).  I am an attorney and need to talk to clients; I need to sound professional.  Unfortunately this $100 headset does not match the sound quality of a $25 wired headset with a boom mic.  I am trying to modify mine by rewiring it with a boom mic from an [...] headset but so far I have not gotten it to work.  I am willing though to risk destroying the JX10 in order to have a chance at better outgoing sound.
2	So far none of the Bluetooth headsets I have tried has surpassed or reached the sound levels and quality of my Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth set to which I always revert after trying a new model in my never ending quest for the perfect Bluetooth headset. Jabra JX10 has approached it a bit more than the other Jabra models me or my wife had (BT250 and BT500) and maybe it has a better fashionable design ultra low weight and slick look but its sound quality is still one class below Plantronics.PROS:- Extremely small and light- Can be charged from a PC with a micro USB cable- Among all the Jabra headsets I had (BT250 and BT500) JX10 has the best outgoing sound quality and level.  My conversation partners could hear me just fine (surprise because I didn't believe into microphones being in my ear instead of close to my mouth).- It can supposedly be worn with or without the ear clip (hook).- Very nice fashionable and sophisticated design for a graceful lady or a slower moving person (my sudden moves in the gym car or with my little daughter sometimes knock this set out of my ear)CONS:- Incoming sound has a great deal of static unless the phone is very next to the set (it's so bad that when I decide to change the ear I have to move the phone to the same side of the body)- Volume level is too low for city dwellers unless I forcefully press it hard against and into my ear.- It doesn't fit well and stick inside my earlobe with or without the plastic hook:With the hook it sticks out a bit and doesn't fit into the ear as closeWithout the hook it falls off too easily and too often (if you think the problem is in my ears on one occasion a plastic surgeon chose me as an example to demonstrate that nobody's ears are perfect because I was physically closest to him but then he changed his mind.)  I choose to wear it without the hook because it fits better into my ear but I'd never ride my bike or do any sudden movements without the hook.- It's so light that I don't feel it if it falls off- For the above reasons I definitely don't recommend it for sporty and fast moving individualsBottom line: Nice and fashionable set for people who don't move much and won't use it outside or in noisy areas.
2	I can hear people on it fine but have had nothing but complaints from friends.  I can't use it.
0	Reviews on this product were very good but there was one piece that would have likely broke easily per reviews and for this price point I decided to return it.
2	I got this battery last year from my dad who said he got it on amazon for three fifty worked mint and fixed all my phone issues (except ringer though not their fault att doesn't support all features on my motorolla phone also bought on amazon) phone cutting off no low batt warning the batter was lasting for a week approx new now I only get a day or two at most before needing to recharge but can still make at least three normal call (hold push this your call is important to us enter this leave a message etc) thats fifteen minutes of calls.  Now this new battery I got to get a full week again after full charge being unplugged for three hours after one five minute phone call if it was that was in the red (battery dead).  Makes no sense charged it yesterday and haven't had any calls or made and it still shows three bars (seventeen or so hours later)  contacted the company to let them know it dies quickly with just one call they said they needed my phone number for more info (sent it).  Then checked the second email from them on the same day they were both sent which said sorry mass volume business replacements already been sent. (don't know why they wanted my number lol) they were on it so if this comes and works fine I'll say five for quality and five for customer service.  (note:sfplanets ipod replacement headphones for 1.99 have serious issues both right sided one side tinny they couldn't send me a good pair twice gave up for two bucks I'll ware a hat to keep in the rightees and tiny one works just sounds funny on one side anyway this is not them)  If it doesn't work or is the same as the one they sent I'll give a two I guess just for the good quick customer service and use my old battery at least it gets three good phone calls.  Remember got a cheap replacement phone just to get by is my only phone so it's needed and don't want to pay full retail for a new in factory plasic battery.  Plus I guess I've got the one phone call battery and the new one which well see what that is and despite inconvenience I may carry them as back up for certain scenarios just to be able to make one last call so to say.  Hate doing that though be nice if stuff just worked fine first one ordered did.  Oh I'm gonna talk to my dad and have him check his amazon records to find out who he bought it from and order one from them if this replacement doesn't work.  Tired of extra's heaphones batteries especially when their faulty.  Though we'll see if these guys are like sf planet and I'll repost to let you know what happened.  My reviews are always long but give almost all the details.
0	Doesn't work phone keep showing invalid battery.  Wasted my money!  Thought about returning it but it's cheap so I just don't bother.
2	This is a great product for an entry level user...Pros:-Good sound (not great just good) bluetooth will not deliver as much quality as wired audio... still enjoyable-Great range and full featured remote control (Can be used is you connect your player to an stereo as only remote control)...-It includes a 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable for plugging to any player of when you ran out of battery (too bad is not 3.5-3.5)...-I have been using them for 2 days now... a lot.. and I have not charge them twice yet... So great battery life so far...Cons:-After a while (an hour or so) it start hurting the upper part of my ear. This is the worst part of this product... But its ok for casual listening-Sound is ok and volume level is low for noisy enviroments... Keep on mind these ara open headphones... so sound will be lost.-I already have a button hard to press... (prev. song) and I have not pressed excesively hard...-Overall feels cheap even though it looks great... and the band might break easy cause is plastic...I know I gave it 3 stars... it does have many Cons... but I am happy with my purchase.. I will enjoy them a lot..
0	after wearing for a few mintues i got blister and swelling ears. it has no insulator. it hurt the back of the ears so bad and that when i notice i have blister. i dont know why motorolla  called themselve engineer. you dont need a rocket scientist to have some kind of pads or insulator to protect your skin
2	I've had these for a while and liked them.  If I wear them for more than 30 minutes the top of my ears against my head hurt.  I was willing to put up with that because I liked the wireless aspect and they sounded good.  The ear cushion is great it's just the weight pushing the rubber shark fin piece against your ears that hurts after a while.Recently I laid them down at work over the weekend.  I guess I laid them down incorrectly because they are now misshapen.  Once that happens you are out of luck.  They will no longer fit against your ears.So they sound great but no longer fit.  I think the ear pieces are just too heavy and it relies on the plastic head/neck band piece to maintain an exact shape.Anyway I am disappointed and will not buy this model again.
0	I got a defective purchase item here and am still awaiting the RMA from the seller.  Not really a comfortable product to wear.  Can't comment on the product as it has never worked to date. But I can say this was a bad buy in that the rig is not very comfortable to wear.  I can say look to other products to meet your needs.
2	Ok so I went thru hundreds of reviews on this product and simply decided I would give it a try for myself. I paired it with my Sanyo Katana DLX and quite a few of the negatives stuck out to me right away. For starters i luv my music loud and when listening to these headphones the sound is simply mediocre. It sometimes emits a lot of static as well. The buttons on each side are extremely easy to push and after wearing them for maybe 15-20 minutes it tends to make my left ear quite tender causing a readjustment or simple rest from it. I was really satisfied with my jabra bt500 and had faith that this one would deliver as well but in the end it was just ok. I also attempted the firmware download and it made not one difference it almost seemed as if it made it slightly worse. I'm thinking maybe it has something to do with the type of cell phone I have. It also seems at certain points during the song the music would come to a slow and then speed up during song strange. It would really be helpful if people would list the type of c.phone they have so potential buyers would see and possibly keep looking if c.phones listed turn out to be incompatible. Overall it'll do for now considering the price but i will be on the market soon looking for an upgrade.
0	I upgraded from a Nokia 6600 (which I loved but it wasn't the hottest looking phone) and have also had the Motorola A630.  This phone is nice dainty and has a great display but it ends there:*) The speaker isn't loud enough so you're always pressing the phone to your ear so incredibly hard and still can't hear too well - I called T-Mobile they acknowledged the problem and sent instructions to the phone to increase the speaker volume to no avail.*) The slider is hard to get to quickly - if you try sliding the phone open many times you will actually reject a call.*) Using call waiting isn't too bad - when you go to call waiting it is easy but retrieving a call is painful*) Text messages - this is the worst ever - first slide the phone open create a message hit the enter key then recent log then select your recipients then next then enter then the message sends.  On the nokia it was create the message hit the green button enter your destination hit the green button.*) deleting messages is worse!  select the message hit options hit delete (sometimes it's 4 sometimes 6) are you sure hit yes done.  On the nokia select the message and hit c and you were instantly done.*) bluetooth - it's supposed to be convenient but NO you are always asked if you want to connect - there is no such thing as auto-connect!  every time I get in my car I have to get the phone out of my pocket and unlock the phone then hit yes or I'll be nagged every few seconds by a noise.  Oh and if I hit NO (when someone else is in the car and I don't want calls going to the car) it'll ask me again in about 5 seconds.  ARRRGH!This baby is going back!  I'm now gonna try out the Blackberry 8700.
2	July 2007:Great form factor mediocre features weak Mac supportForm:As an exclusive candybar user (Nokia & Sony-Ericsson both high end and mid range) I was trepidatious of using a slider. In lieu of a decent nonflip bluetooth/camera phone w/ Tmobile I went with this phone. Friends and strangers alike say: ooh how pretty. I say ...Pros:1. 1.3 Mp camera2. Bluetooth3. most vivid clear screen I've seen on a cell4. good form factor5. opens & closes very well well (1st edition I had was a little clunky had a Samsung China sticker on the inside 2nd edition I had (replaced due to bad mic) doesn't have a manufacturer's tag)6. far better reception inside buildings than my previous SE T610 (w/ Tmo)7. camera has great & funny options such as cartoon bubbles and image overlays which all my friends think are hilarious thereby enhancing the blackmail potential or storytelling function of my phone's camera - good times! This little feature is silly but makes me smile so much; if all features of the phone made me smile like this I would have kept this phone.Cons:1. lack of customizability- no favorites/shortcuts- soft keys cannot be changed- cannot use .3gp files or .mp3 files as ring tones (on 1st handset (which I had for 3 weeks but which Tmo replaced due to a microphone problem) I could on 2nd handset this functionality was gone! I understand Tmo locks this functionality so you have to buy ringtones from them whatevs Tmo!)2. lack of functionality- menu inaccessable during calls (cannot text or surf during calls)- no airplane mode- no notes function- poor Mac supprt- - does not work with Mac iSync (although you can send numbers to phone from Mac Address Book (Menu: Card > Send card) via Bluetooth which is at least some convenience but not the convenience of iSync)- - my Mac OS 10.2.8 and OS 10.4.6 computers are unable to use dial up networking via Bluetooth or USB cable (despite the EDGE functionality and the claims of the sweet T-mobile techies who I don't believe)- - Bluetooth (via my Mac) only browses the memory card as far as I can tell eg sees pics only in the memory card3. GUI isn't well thought out - menu navigation difficult sending text message requires a number of button pushes once the text is done (sending a text to multiple people is a major chore) finding files is not intuitive submenus with similar functions are dissimilar between different apps (compare to the File menu on all Windows programs it's the same because it makes thins easier Samsung hasn't figured this little design STANDARD out)4. 1.3 Mp camera makes 17-40 kb sized pics ... WTF?!?5. problem with microSD card staying firmly inserted aftermarket purchased card (necessary for music or multiple pics) pops outI will not buy a Samsung phone again. My phone MUST sync immediately and completely with whatever computer I have whether Mac Windows or Linux; currently the one I have is a Mac. Hello: Mac Samsung communitcate!! My previous phone the SE T610 synched its contact list flawlessly to my Mac. The Samsung t809 database file type is currently incompatible with iSync. Don't believe claims on this or other websites saying the t809 sync's with Macs.Every single Samsung product (phones home entertainment etc) I have bought in the past 3 years has looked pretty and been supposedly loaded with features. However each was loaded with glitches. No more Samsung for me!Wish I had gotten a RAZR (free or nearly so with Tmo) held out for a Motorola Capri or splurged and gotten a fabulous unlocked Nokia (every one I've had has been outstanding).UPDATE as of November 2006:The phone is not as sturdy as I had assumed. After having placed the intact phone in my cargo pants pocket squatting down while painting and standing back up the phone stopped playing the mp3 I was blaring with the nice loud speaker. I took the phone out of the pocket and HORRORS! the inside/backside screen was cracked (the one inside the casing I guess) which voided the warranty since the Tmo warranty doesn't apply to cracked screens. Tmo sent me a replacement but I sent it back because they were going to charge another $150 for this irritation phone.
2	It looks very sweet.  Awesome screen and speakers.  Some decent hacks for it on howardforums dot com!  It's battery life is almost pathetic though.  It's reception is poor.  The big exposed screen is also prone to scratching and getting dust/dirt under it.  You also can't use mp3's for ringtones without hacking/cheating it.  Rename mp3 to 3gp copy to micro-sd then copy back to phone memory.What really killed the deal for me was the reception though.  Had a Nokia 3650 awsome even worked ok in my basement next a Moto V330 barely worked upstairs just bought 2 of these T809's and they won't even recieve good enough to let me setup my voice mail in my livingroom.  Called T-Mobile support..  They are putting in a request to point an antenna towards my house.  I'm request #2.  I wish they just sold a decent Nokia.  Using the phone outside is going to get old once it starts snowing here in Michigan.Bottom line: If you just want a sweet looking phone this is it.  If you want a usable dependable phone look elsewhere.  This is like the RAZR's.  Form over function.  T-Mobile used to have lots of sweet Nokias then they went to so-so Motorolas now they are pushing Samdung and whatever is cheap.  Not a good thing.  -  Joe
2	I have had the PEBL for two weeks now and it really is as slick as everyone says.  Bluetooth and very good battery life are two of the pluses.  However as other reviewers have cited there are flaws:- The directional button is already missing paint in a few places from the screen sliding past it when the phone is opened.  If I am seeing paint missing after only two weeks I shudder to think what will happen after a few months.- The inside is definitely prone to getting dirty with fingerprints.- The magnets require you to keep the phone away from your credit cards as well as items such as your computer.- The first PEBL I received rang only intermittently.  Sometimes it would ring and others it woudnt do anything.  In these cases I would only know that calls had been missed once the voice mail indicator showed.  The replacement phone I received now rings with every every call.- Connecting to the Bluetooth headset requires a sequence of six or so steps and therefore must be done before turning on your car if you are going to talk while driving.  No way can I connect the headset while paying attention to the road.  I have always used corded headsets prior to this and I find this to be annoying.- It took a few tries to get the hang of the voice commands.  I would say name dial and it would keep asking me to repeat the command or tell me that the command could not be found.  However then I noticed that there is a beep after which you say the command.  As long as you wait for the beep the voice commands work fine.- The phone opens when dropped.In summary if you want a very cool looking eye catching phone than the PEBL is for you.  However if you are someone who does not care about the appearance of the phone I would recommend looking at other models because all of the problems with the PEBL make it only about looks.
2	Motorola RAZR V3i worked good when new. Music that was installed did not play continously. To play music I had to play one by one manually. Charge to battery did not last very long and had to be charged daily as battery life was short. Ring tones were loud and audible. The one I purchased worked for a good year. Wished it could last longer.
2	Beware!!  I bought an unlocked Razr V3i straight from Motorola to get the nifty purple color that's offered only on their website.  Bad bad bad idea.  About a month after I bought it the phone started to act all crazy - turning off and on randomly screen going dim etc.  I mailed it in (the problem later turned out to be the SIM card) and when the phone was returned to me it had been LOCKED to the Cingular network.What the heck is going on here!!  I paid nearly three times more money than a comparable phone to get an unlocked product - I travel a lot and the last thing I need is paying Cingular's outrageous prices for overseas roaming and carrier services.So I called the Motorola customer service number.  And waited on hold.  And waited.  And waited.  And finally was connected with a very nice gentleman who promised he would have a supervisor return my call.  Well that was the first call.  After a week of no return call I called again - I wound up having to call a total of four times with an average of 45 minutes' hold time each call.When it finally became obvious that nobody was going to return my call I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau using Motorola's Chicago business address as the complainant.  FINALLY someone called me back and - a miracle!  I got a new phone!However the story doesn't end here.  I mailed back the old phone per the instructions and a week or so later I received the phone BACK from Motorola's Customer Service - claiming they had already fixed the problem.I'm still waiting for Motorola to call me back to request their old phone back.  There's nothing wrong with it except that it's locked to the Cingular network.The phone itself seems to have good sound quality and range and it does hold a charge for a reasonably long amount of time.  That said you can't save more than ten or twelve text messages on it and you can't back up your messages to your MacBookPro.I bought an Iphone a while ago.  I'll probably still use the Motorola for traveling but if I were you I'd think long and hard about purchasing a product for which it's nearly impossible to redeem the warranty.
2	I have to give Motorola credit for the entire RAZR lineup because it is definitely the coolest phone I've ever seen.  It created the market and improved it on each iteration.  So design is five star without question.  The phone itself makes calls and the speakerphone is loud as it should be.  I love the exterior LCD screen.And that's about it for likes.The dislikes are numerous for me because I own a Nokia 3650 which at the time was the best phone you could get (2003).  Now it's outdated but here's some interesting points:-my phone takes pictures of equal quality-sound playback is equal to my phone-I have unrestricted Java applet usage including a MUCH larger library of available programs-my sync manager does much more than Motorola's including much better integration with Outlook-my UI doesn't suckI've had my cell phone for five years which is an ETERNITY for cell phones but it's still not out-featured by this phone.  I tried to get an eBook reader for a RAZR and all I could find were sites that basically make you compile a JAR file and unlock your phone to transfer it... where it may or may not run.Contrast with my Nokia 3650: I downloaded a free eBook reader (Mobipocket) using Nokia's software (which can be downloaded for free from Nokia) and I was in business.  Vendor lock-in for cell phones is a big problem for me and maybe it is for you too.This is a stylish phone that epitomizes form over function.-C
2	I was very disappointed that the head/tip of this cable is too wide to fit through the opening of most shells - while it looks similar in size to a standard OEM/Apple tip it's not an is about one-quarter of an inch wider and thus doesn't connect to the charge port on the bottom of an iPhone 4.  Very poor design on Belkin's part.
2	This battery was bought to replace an old battery yet performs only slightly better than the old one.
2	The first battery held a charge for maybe 6 hours. I contacted MyNetDeals and the very same day they sent me another one. I am using that battery but the charge only lasts two days at the most.
0	ordered 2 of these a couple of weeks ago got them in decent time put them in phone and charged them neither battery lasted more than 48hrs MAX with less than 10 mins talk time.Sent email to company they were nice and sent 2 more batteries plus a return envelope to send first two back with put in the next ones charged and same thing within 48hrs both batteries dead with virtually zero talk time on them.Sending all 4 back.Im guessing you basically get what you pay for.
2	I've had this headset for about a year now; I use it with a Razr.  It's a fine headset from a technical perspective: the sound is fine it's easy to pair and use etc.  I haven't run into any problems using it in a car or out of doors.However it's really not very comfortable: the hook that goes over the ear is just a bit too stiff and edgy I wouldn't want to wear it for a long call (more than 15-20min say).For comfort and performance consider the Plantronics Voyager 510 (around $50 at Amazon); I've had one of those (now used by my son) and it is excellent.  If you're into new gadgets check out the Jawbone sets -- I haven't used one but a colleague swears by the one he's been using for a couple of months.
2	Overall this works pretty good...it rarely gets confused like a lot of the headsets with only one button do. My main complaint is that the volume just isn't very loud...even turned up on max. And that makes it very hard to use in the car when you have a lot of road noise or rain etc.
0	Don't get me wrong the H3 looks good and sleek but it gives too much feed back. What I mean by that is that when your on the phone the other party hears an echo.  This happend on all the calls. The only thing that kept me from returning it was that I lost the receipt and i threw away the box!  I don't recomend wasting your money on this. One you may try that has worked for me is the H500.  Cheap looks ok and best of all it works!!!!  Oh yeah my Razor had a hard time linking to the H3.
0	I bought this direct from Amazon and their unlocked phone is technically unlocked but it has Cingular-branded firmware.For anyone not familiar with that branded is a euphemism for hacked up by the carrier to remove features and replace useful menu options with links to buy stuff.  I guess branded is shorter than saying all that.This is not a clean L7.  You may as well buy an unlocked Cingular phone from ebay.I have not yet checked all features to see what has been removed from this phone although I immediately notice that even signed Java applications require constant permission while an unbranded phone would accept the Verisign certificate.
2	Update - Cingular sent me a replacement for my SLVR.  It has the same problems.  That's three phones out of three - two for me and one for my daughter - with the same problem.  Lockups and intermittent operation.  I finally figured out part of the problem.  Whenever an attempted voice dial fails whether it was an intentional dial or an accident of pressing the button by mistake or pressing the headset button too long then the phone will not make or receive any calls until you power it off and on again.  At least now if I am really careful how I handle it my phone works most of the time.  My suggestion is not to buy this phone for another 6 months or a year!Original review follows:This is a great phone when it works.  There was a report this week on CNN about the RAZR phones that were sold late February 2006 and early March 2006 being recalled for a software bug.  It is my guess that the SLVR which is a close relative of the RAZR has the same bug because my SLVR only works about half the time.  Most of the time when I try to make a call the display will say Calling xxxxxxx but it just hangs there until I click End even up to 20 minutes with nothing happening.Any time I don't use my bluetooth headset for a few hours and then try to use it the bluetooth on the phone will have quit working and to get it working again I have to power the phone off and on again.My daughter has the same phone and has the same problems.When it works though it is a great phone.  The iTunes holds only 100 songs like the other reviews said but that's an iTunes issue - it treats this like an iPod Nano.Cingular is sending me a replacement for my SLVR and hopefully it will work better and have these issues resolved.  In the mean time I suggest giving more time for the bugs to be worked out.  Once it becomes more reliable I would highly recommend the phone.
0	Pouch felt clumsy. There was extra play where the phone could wiggle around in. Also the clip is so thin that it's not good with sweatpants or scrubs. With the weight of the phone it will flip over if it's not clipped onto a belt.
2	I've owned two of these. It is great that it rests against your ear and is very comfortable not having an earpiece sticking in your ear. The first one I owned after a month lost most of its volume. I could not make the volume louder via the volume control; the volume control actually never seemed to work but at least at first the volume was real good...for about a month. The second one I bought lasted about 9 months but now the button to answer or hang up on a call does not work.
0	The first headset I was sent was DOA.  I was told to pay the return shipping and a replacement unit would be sent out.  I did that and received another unit and guess what..... Correct it was another defective unit.  I have tried contacting the seller multiple times and they have not responded.  Anybody want a good deal on a broken headset?
0	This product arrived on time but I nor several other people including personnel at Verizon or Apple could not get it to connect to the phone.  So it had to be sent back.
0	this bluetooth headset is probably one of the worst you can ever waste money on.For some odd reason all of my motorola bluetooth including this one has really really bad static.I cannot clearly hear the other person and the other person cannot hear me.I would save my money and buy a different brand altogether.Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset
2	The H700 some love it some hate it. Wherever you fall a lot of people are talking about it.PRO's / CON'sIt is comfortable and light. / Depending on the size of your face your cheek may block the microphone resulting in muffled sound.If you are a lady with long hair that falls over your ear it will get caught in the boom microphone and snagged by the rubber tip as you flip the boom open and closed to answer calls.Distance is quoted as up to 30 feet / Some phone combinations have distance issues if the headset and phone are not on the same side of your body.Pairs well with my Motorola Razr V3 and Cingular 8125. / Other phones and PDA's have problems SO your mileage may vary.The controls are small multifunction (each button does may things) and are easy to access but hey they are on the side of your head.Microphone is Very sensitive / People have complained about wind noise echoes in rooms and Who else is in the car with you ?Headset volume is loud louder than most / Its adjustable so this is a good thing.The headset lights up in four different colors to show various status (charging pairing standby etc) / You can turn off the flashing blue 'dork lamp' but it will come back on after the headset is turned off and on again.A note a caution1. This is a young product and the complaints and returns have resulted in two versions (Version A and Version B) of this headset in the market. Version B fixes a number of problems that version A had with certain phones.2. Distance is POOR compare to other headsets and even other Motorola Bluetooth products. I have changed my headset and Cingular has replaced the phones (Razr V3 and 8125) twice with no improvement. Distance is less than 10 feet with Static and dropped calls. Do not expect to leave your phone in the car and pump gas or get the mail without complaints. Some folks with the Verizon V3C Razr have reported getting better distance but nothing past 15 feet.3. Motorola gives you 30 days to try and return with refund However the return shipping is ON YOU. So with shipping / tracking / insurance expect to spend another $5 even if its their problem and there are problems with this headset.If its longer than 30 days you are stuck with it.I would give it 5 stars for Style 3 stars for execution 2 stars for how well it works and 1 star for their support policy.Google Motorola H700 problems make an informed decision. If you can try before you buy. $100 May Not buy you the best maybe just the smallest. I am waiting on Motorola to replace it one last time.UPDATEProduct was returned and received by Motorola 6/15. A new one was to go out 2 day FedEx.22 Days later I received it today 7/7 just the headset. NO charger manual case or  warranty card.Dead as a door nail with no charger to check it.  After 30 minutes on hold they will now replace the Whole product as ordered and returned #98686H. Would not refund shipping charges.  For those contemplating a replacement make sure they send out the latest headset part # SYN1311B.Remember a company is as the sum of its parts support 0 stars.
0	I saw the reviews for this headset on CNET and I was pretty excited about getting it to use with my LG VX-9400 phone.  The Verizon sales agent recommended it to me because they H700 had the same version of bluetooth.  That was the reason she gave for my Jabra BT350v having lots of static when using with the 9400.Well the results with the H700 were actually worse.  The callers on the other end said that the static was painful to their ears it was so bad.  I heard some static on my end which has never been the case with any headset phone pairing that I've had.  After one day I boxed it back up and sent it back to Amazon.One thing to note.  This must be taken in the context of the phone it was paired with.  If you are not using the LG VX-9400 your experience will likely be different.  If at all possible find a headset that others have already used with your phone and have reported success with.  Otherwise you are rolling the dice.  Sites like Howard Forums (Google it) are good for finding out what others have experienced.  Good luck!
2	I used to love this bluetooth headset. I used it for about two years and loved how quick it was to answer calls by just flipping it open. I also like that you can easily switch it from right ear to left ear by just pulling the hook off.The buttons on this device are easy to access and it was comfortable enough to use for extended periods of time.However overtime the static on the calls just got worse and worse until I could no longer use this without people getting really annoyed. I don't know if maybe I dropped it too many times or if moisture got into it but after working well for about a year and a half I had to retire this device. I now use the H730:Motorola H730 (Bulk Packaged)Even at its best people could still tell that I was using a bluetooth when speaking with this device. Since upgrading to the H730 I have not had a single person ask if I was using a bluetooth. I think the placement of the microphone hole on the newer version may have some impact on that as it is away from your face more on the newer version compared with being on the actual flip-open boom piece that rests on your cheek. For these reasons I only gave this bluetooth 3 stars and would recommend the H730 instead.
0	I purchased this product for a dive trip to Fiji. While in Fiji I decided to take a kayak out with my camera inside this 'waterproof' case. The case was sitting between my legs and during the trip out it slid into some water. The water was maybe 2&#34; deep. It didn't even completely submerge the case. Once I was out a ways I wanted to take a picture of the resort. When I lifted the case I knew there was an issue right away when water came pouring out.My camera was ruined on the 2nd day of my 10-day vacation. There is no place to find another camera. I would have been better off putting the camera in my pocket than this case.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!
2	I have had this phone for almost a year now. I have not had any major issues. Though a little slippery to hold. The bad part about the keyboard is that you have to use two hands for it. I have been reading about people losing their stylus' I haven't had that problem so far. I have added a 2GB mini SD card for my tunes. Although this phone does not like Macs it is a good windows device which requires occasional reset. A built-in task manager would help.
2	Great interface but the pen is faulty. I have used the Palm and the pen is easy to use. The pen for the mda doesn't work sometimes and it's operation isn't smooth. The screen isn't very big which is a turn off for such a heavy and bulky tool.The email tool doesn't have an option to set business hours so you have it still downloading mail 24hrs that wasn't good. i like my business tool silent when I am at home. And it is locked by T-mobile such that you can't install Java applications like Google maps.I returned it for the weight it should give me the feel of an HP-IPAQ or mini-computer but I didn't get that feel at all.
2	The MDA designed and made by Taiwan's HTC a leader in the Windows Mobile smart phone market (they seem to make all the WM phones sold in the U.S.) is really a cool concept.  It has a nice shape a slide-out thumbboard that automatically turns the screen to landscape and all the goodies that make up Windows Mobile: Pocket Office Pocket IE MSN Messenger Windows Media Player 10 and tons of free software to download from the web.  Plus it has wi-fi which works really well.I really wanted to like the MDA as I decided not to get a Palm-based Treo due to severe syncing problems with Outlook (problems that were supposed to be fixed in the now-vaporware Palm OS 6 Cobalt).  And I wanted to like T-Mobile because they are the only carrier out there that forces you on a one-year not two-year contract (and still gives you a rebate).  Anyway after a few days I was sorely disappointed.  The problem lay entirely with the MDA's reception.  It was almost the same problem I had with the original Sidekick back in 2003.  The MDA's antenna was never able to grab a signal strong enough to make web surfing any close to being useable.  And it would constantly lose and hunt for signal.  It was frustrating to no end even in the heart of Boston where a RAZR tmo phone had full reception.  I never got half the speed promised by EDGE the 2.5G GSM data network.  Very very disappointing.  Much much worse than the EVDO services I had earlier this year tried with Sprint and Verizon.Summary: the MDA has all the potentials of a major league star except the ability/stamina to stick out for more than one inning.  It's a dud thanks partly to HTC's poor antenna design and/or construction and partly to T-Mobile's poor EDGE and GPRS support.  If you can stand a two-year commitment go with Sprint's PPC-6700 also made by HTC with the same sliding thumbboard design.  I haven't tried the PPC-6700 yet (cuz I'm pretty much broke now) but online reviews are mostly positive.
2	I really really wanted to like this phone.  I use a dialup POP account to access the web (from an old Treo 270) and bought this phone because it allows dialup IP connections where the Treo 650 doesn't.  I'd originally purchased a 650 and returned it because it prevents you from accessing the web via dialup (as soon as you put in the SIM card it defaults to T-Mobile's GPRS network and locks out any other type of internet connection).Unfortunately the PocketPC interface is absolutely unintuitive as compared to the Palm OS.  Where the Palm may require one or two clicks to access something or intitiate a task the PocketPC requires you go through very cumbersome menus in order to achieve the same actions.  Learning these menus is a real pain.  Even such simple items as exiting a program or function can be frustrating because the commands needed to do so will change depending on the application you may be running (something as basic as a close box will move location from one program to another).  How do I get out of this?  one app has a close box in the upper right hand of the screen another app. requires you to access a menu and then close.  When using the phone turning on the speakerphone requires going through two menus where in the Palm OS it's thoughtfully placed right on your main phone screen.The slide out keyboard although it looks cool- is very difficult to use.  Because the keys need to be flat in order to fit under the slide they are not tactile enough to distinguish easily with your thumb there is little resistance to activating them and it is very easy to press the wrong key unintentionally.  The stylus is laughably unusable as it's located on the bottom of the unit is too small as well as being telescoping in a way where it's constantly collapsing as you try to use it.Where the Treo has a physical exterior switch to go into vibrate or quiet mode the MDA/KJAM requires you to go through at least 2 onscreen menus to turn off the ringer.  I bought a 1 Gig memory card for the unit but can't seem to get it to save pix or video to the card.  I'm sure there's a way to do it but again it requires learning more unintuitive steps & configurations from the manual.  When talking on the phone it's very easy to touch the screen with your ear or face so that functions and applications accidentally launch.  It's processor is relatively slow and there is almost always a 2 second lag between launching something and being able to access it.The WiFi does work very well and makes browsing a breeze. The screen is bright and clear.  Bluetooth is decent but sound quality suffers.  If your a techie who doesn't mind going through an extensive learning curve the unit is as feature packed as you can get and more powerful than most other PDA/Phones on the market.  I also like the fact it uses a standard non proprietary USB mini plug for synching and charging making it possible to charge the unit with cables already on hand from other devices if necessary.It's not a bad phone but needs a lot of improvements before being something practical to use on a daily basis.  After coming from the Palm OS PocketPC is kind of like eating at Dominos after growing up on NYC Pizza.
0	Motorola should do better. This product would not install in ether of my state of the art computers.  Find a program from another source.  Save yourself some headaches.
2	My consonants aren't well pronounced and my voice is pretty smooth--not loud. I have a hard time finding headsets that work. I was expecting this one to work well since it had a boom mic. But people still had a hard time hearing me. They don't have a hard time when I talk on my Samsung Epic Touch. So this was a worse experience for my listeners. It doesn't have any noise cancellation which might be part of the issue. It's a great headset for the price but if you're a person who tends to mumble or be soft spoken I would try another Plantronics headset. My trusty dusty is the Plantronics MX150. People can't tell a difference between that and the mic on my cell phone. I just keep buying them. I would love to find another since I have to keep buying the converters for the headset jack and that's been tough to find ones that work.As for comfort I thought it would be better than some but after wearing it for 30 minutes or so I still get a little ear fatigue and need to take it off. The sound on it is pretty good. Better than the MX150 but obviously not representative of what the person on the other end is hearing.
2	well its a easy product but it is just I hope buy the quality is no so great. . .
0	I'd like to say I was satisfied with this device but I'm not the ATT version for whatever reason was just SOOO much better than this phone on TracFone and it was basically the same phone.Just a stupid phone!!!THE ATT VERSION IS GOOD BUT THIS IS A NO GOOD PHONE!!Hello guys up for reviews today is a phone I once used for tracfone the motorola c139.1st phone it worked good i was in the bathroom flushed the toilet and down went the phone of course it was dead after this and it was gone to the sewer.2nd phone. Had this phone with at&t; service instead of tracfone I noticed a possible ui change better service and the fact you could use this as prepaid or personal because AT&T; does not put a sim lock on pay as you go sim cards.The phone wasn't that good for texting but it was pretty good also for just the games I got addicted to the one where there is the ball and it is kind of like brick attack found on most keyocera phones but i totally forget the name.3rd phone was tracfone i got it for my sister it was washed in the hose fell and got sprayed an a red dot to prove this. got the screen to change colors and call different people from her contacts tried drying and then it stopped even working as even a phone it would go to the tracfone turn on screen reset itself and do it again until you did something like press a button itd go off or the battery would die.it still mysteriously charged so it was used for a moto charger or planned to if i found a phone with the same battery and then all now i get was a lit up keypad. i took it apart which voided the warranty if any since wet. now all i got was nothing and figured i should replace it and recycle it which i did.
0	Beware Tracfone. I regret that Amazon won't let me give them 0 stars. We got this phone for my wife's aunt last December. After 1 year of trying to get this working she still cannot receive calls. She can call out but no one can call her. Tracfone support is useless (and generally only marginally speaks English). You also cannot manage the phone or minutes on line. You have to call in and give them about 60 digits that the phone shows you to do almost anything. We're letting this one die with over 400 units left on it because it is basically useless. Coverage isn't good either but who cares if you can't receive calls anyway? There has got to be a better option because I doubt there are many worse ones.
0	Sucks never worked hated it threw it away. Total waste of time- there are so many better products out there.
0	Very poor product quality. I lost my iPhone 3GS due to to water leak using this product. It was working OK for few occasion after sometime (couple of months of using) it just stop working and water start to leak.
0	I bought this for a cruise to protect my phone cash and other delicate items during a cruise.  5 minutes after being in the water I noticed it was about 1/4 full of water.  The bottom developed a hole after extremely light use.  The cost?  A ruined iPhone 5s.  What a nightmare.  I guess it was stupid of me to trust a 12 dollar &#34;waterproof&#34; pouch with a 600 dollar iphone.  Lesson learned.
2	Bought my cable last year and only used it for a couple of weeks before I decided to replace it with a cable from Nokia.This Eforcity unit is made of cheap-feeling material. Takes a bit to plug into my computer and once it is in still doesn't work a lot of times. So I had to unplug and go thru the process a few times.Yes the price is low. But overall the item is too unstable.
2	This cable functions fine (at first) but it probably won't hold up to everyday use.  I've inserted mine maybe 20 times and one of the spring-loaded contacts just became permanently stuck making the cable worthless.  Sure it's dirt cheap which is nice compared to the expensive real Nokia cable but with what these accessory vendors charge for shipping I'd recommend ordering several of these at one time from a source with a good deal on multiple items.  I'm now trying to decide whether to do that myself or shell out for the real deal with a real warranty.
2	I've had the headphones for a few months already and I have had many problems when pairing them but I suppose it is because of the Treo poor Bluetooth connectivity manager or because of the drivers on my pc.A major drawback that I have found is the pressure it applies to the head is a bit too much.  The problem is after an hour of using them I get a headache.  This is a real problem since I have tried to open them a bit more but the way the plastic band is done it doesn't allow it.A minor drawback is the size since they are very obvious on my ears (normal person) it makes wearing them a bit uncomfortable and for sure rules out using them on the street if you don't want to attract thieves that is.Aside from that on my perspective the sound is good the microphone works very well the battery charge is good volume and other buttons work properly.  I use them to go jogging and I must say they work pretty well even under stress and harsh situations.
2	Bluetooth is nice. The Jabra BT620s allow you pair with two devices and I might add the pairing process is simple.Battery life is excellent.The controls are a bit cumbersome to deal with but with some practice it is simple to adjust the volume answer a call etc.One thing you must remember to do if you don't want to appear bizarre is turn off the blue light that continuously flashes around the lefthand ear piece. It is an annoyance to have to do this every time you turn them on.Sound quality is adequate and no more. I'm hardly an audiophile and don't demand much in the way of fidelity which is a good thing with the BT620s since its audio response is defeinitely lo-fi not HiFi.I am constantly bothered by what sounds like static with my BT620s. When I make a call or dictate a note my voice is recognizeable but it does sound like I am talking through a pipe or something. Overall sound quality with these is barely passable.The wraparound headband is not adjustable. Your tolerance for pain and discomfort on the other hand better be. There is a bit of an art to positioning these on your head. A millimeter this way or that means the difference beween mere discomfort and outright pain. After a while you'll learn where your own sweet spot is with these but I doubt you or I will ever find these things to be comfortable.Is the Jabra BT620 awful? No. But it skates close.Should the time come to get another Bluetooth headset I'd be a lot more careful in making my choice.Jerry
2	I should have paid more attention to the reviews.  I went ahead and ordered these mostly due to price - nowhere can you find wireless stereo headphones for $35!  There's a reason though.  After wearing them for only 30 minutes my ears were very sore.  No way of adjusting them.  Sound is pretty good but certainly can't overcome the discomfort.  Will be returning for credit.
2	I bought this headphones from local storepairing is not hard with laptopthe control layout is a lot like Motorola HT820 (vol and call/power switch are on the left; play and prev/next are on the right)the RF is OK pretty much like Logitechthe problem is sound in hifi mode it sounds like CD player has Mega Bass turned on bass is over-emphasized on some partthe headphone is pretty comfortable to wearI give score of 88/100 the sound in hifi mode is not good as expected also AVRCP is kinda sluggish
2	I came across David Pogue's review of Bluetooth headphones in the New York Times and researched the three sets he mentioned. Compared to the other's the Jabra BT620 was the cheapest and according to Pogue's review all the sets performed similarly so I figured i would give it a try as i have been eager to go wireless for sometime. I had 2 simple and common requirements - that it work with my Blackberry 8830 for calls and music and to be able to stream music from my PC around the house. The Former was a no-go from the start as i was told via email that the Blackberry lacked the right 'Profile' to operate with the Jabra as a music player. Since i already own a regular bluetooth headset for calls the fact that i couldn't use the headsets for music was disappointing. As a bluetooth headset the audio was actually pretty good since it covers both ears and cuts out ambient noise but the microphone was very distorted since the micrphone is not on a boom but built into the earpiece. I can not imagine that you can use these as a phone headset since voice quality is a secondary aspect of the design. After some futzing i was able to get the Jabra working with iTunes and Windows Media Player after installing a Bluetooth USB stick on my PC. However disengaging the headsets and trying to sync back to speakers wouldn't work on either application. The only way i could get it to switch was to reopen the application and in some cases reboot the computer. On the plus side the headphones are well made (for the price) comfortable for my somewhat large head and have good audio quality for most people who aren't audiophiles. The negatives besides the above showstoppers were an extremely short range without breaking up (15 feet seems to be the max)and on a minor note the flashing LED's which can be turned off but has to be done every time you recharge the device. Overall bluetooth promises simplicity but in my experience was anything but. What started out as a promising technology- connect all your devices wirelessly - became the usual gobbledygook of support calls and technospeak and incompatible standards that left one frustrated at the technology. I sent mine back to Amazon for a refund and will stick with wires for a while longer.
2	I agree with other reviews about the design features and charging options but those things come secondary if static over takes them. The static is real even the phone is only inches away from the unit. Unlike my earlier Bluetooth devices this one has really short range...like 3 feet. I can not live with static so this one is going back.Sorry Blueant.
2	Looks very cool.  Very convenient charging via USB port.  Not so good sound quality.  Audio has a lot of static tics and pops and that is the only reason I give this 2 stars.  Everything else is great.Pairs quickly with my Nextel i870.I lost my Plantronics 510 so will fall back to this unit until I can find the latest earpiece that has received good reviews.  Other may have a great experience with this earpiece.  Unfortunately I am not one of them.  Maybe I got a bad one.
2	As other reviews have said this works quite well as a bluetooth speaker phone. However the visor clip on mine kept slipping on the visor resulting in the phone moving around.  When I moved the phone to the other end of the visor hoping that being closer to the connection to the car instead of a snap that held it in place would result in less vibration and hence less motion it failed to cover the road noise. I suspect this is more a problem with my car in that the visor bounces more and is slippery than with the speakerphone but it stillwent back.
2	The sound quality in the car is great.  The callers often complain that they can't understand me despite talking directly into the mic.The thing that makes this unuseable is that it often links to my phone but doesn't actually connect.  I may or may not hear it ringing when I make a call... and even though I am connected to the device when the caller answers we can't hear each other....it isn't really connected.so this is useless
2	I'm not sure of the use of this product when using it for the headset it doesn't stay in very well it tends to fallout when walking or running this product must be for storing the device only
2	Though the Platntronics Voyager 510 works quite well I was terribly disappointed with the accompanying carrying case which cost me an addtional $25! It's simply too small for the headset!
2	This case is ok is kind of thigh for the headset it could be a little bigger and the depending on how you place the headset the microphone or the ear attach part are unprotected because the case doesn't cover the whole headset.
2	My T616 brought me to Sony Ericsson; my S710a almost drove me away. I decided to give Sony Ericsson (SE) another chance with the W810.Should be an awesome phone right? Good-looking and well-built. Quad-band and EDGE. Walkman player and 2 MP auto-focus camera. That great SE interface made even better and now lacking the infamous sluggishness of past phones. And as always one of the best Bluetooth implementations available.And yet... My first phone died within 12 hours of using it; first power-cycle resulted in a flashing white screen. The replacement phone from SE's service center was shipped in a partially disassembled state. The replacement for *that* phone was fine for two months but now has a FastPort that's going bad (wired stereo headsets - and I've tried a few - don't work properly any more). This phone will be going back as well but what am I going to get in exchange now?I give the phone itself 4 stars (my increasing concerns over its) build quality 3 stars and SE's lousy service and support 2 stars. That averages out to the 3-star rating I've given above.
2	I bought one of these for a back-up charger. Does the job.I prefer my tiny Nokia CA-100 USB charger though and use it the most.Works nice with my Nokia N95-3 phone and Nokia 800 Internet Tablet.
0	Don't buy this adapter!!  The picture shown is not what you will receive the picture shows a genuine Nokia adapter but what you get is a cheap piece of crap that doesn't even have the same specifications as the Nokia adapter. So if you don't want to fry your device don't buy this.
0	I want to warn IT professionals that Verizon Wireless phone data email service is inappropriately spoofing sender's email address in messages sent from Motorola Q. This is creating problems with our anti-spam filters and I also believe this is unethical and should be illegal. We recommend against buying phones with this data/email service in our organization.When we configure our IMAP server option for the Motorola Q phone owned by one of our executives the Verizon system is spoofing the email address as if the messages are being sent from our email server. These external but spoofed as internal messages get blocked by our anti-spam filters.When we wanted to try to white list (unblock) the Verizon servers on our anti-spam server their technical support and Verizon representatives refused to give us the IP addresses of the servers from which email messages are being sent. This was probably refused by their network administrators for security concerns and I don't blame them for this. I'm sure they will agree with me that the problem should be instead resolved within Verizon's system software solution.Instead of spoofing a desired email address messages coming from Verizon phones should have a distinct From and Reply-to addresses with the first being any external Verizon wireless address and the latter being the customer's desired and commonly used email address. The two must differ and only then the messages will not end up as spam because the sender won't be spoofed.Although Q seems like a good device we advise against purchase and don't support their email integration in our organization until Verizon Wireless makes both From and Reply-to fields configurable. Small shops with Microsoft Exchange and loose anti-spam settings probably won't have problems like this.
0	I will be reluctantly getting my 3rd Q (replacement). I've only had this 2nd one for maybe 2 months. It would freeze constantly during the past 2 months forcing me to remove the battery for a restart. Now I have the dreaded Black Screen of Death with motorola flash mode bootloader version: boot_c_03.08.00R_MPAP. Anytime bloggers start naming how your phone dies its a very bad sign!
2	This is the phone Cingular insurance replaced my Sony Ericsson W600i phone with.  Supposedly if they can't give you the same phone (which they couldn't because the W600i has been discontinued) they're supposed to replace it with something comparable.  There's about a $150 price difference between these two phones so I'm not sure how they figure these two are comparable but oh well.Cons: the speaker is way too quiet the proprietary data cable is not included the clear button is too close to the down arrow and turning the volume up or down is annoying because it rings. I also have a glitch in my phone where it sometimes rings for no reason after adjusting the volume and the only way to get it to stop is to power off the phone.Pros: looks cool slide function is fun easy to use stays locked large display lightweight and slim.Bottom Line:  Would I buy it?  No.
0	Phone Experience:Its light and sleek and does perform very well as basic phone charge every 2 days not 2 times a day as I use to do with smartphone.This phone's interfaces are so old that looks like I am using those old bulky Nokia phones specially switching from smart-phone. This is slow and very limited capabilities. Krzr seems to have lot better interfaces.Verizon Experience:At least I am not getting that many dropped calls as it was with Cingular. Its much better reception.Some things that I encountered so far are: Verizon charges you for 1 month advance monthly access fee so your first month with activation will cost $250-300 excluding phone cost. Next they charged me $15 because I ported my old number in past I received this service free with T-Mobile and Cingular.Customer service is not friendly at all.Amazon Experience:The sad part of my story starts when I received this phone.I opened the box and it looked like used phone with dust inside plastic protector and edges coming off and scratches where Mini-SD card goes. I thought its not a big deal so I called Verizon they came up with resolution after couple calls and hold time that goto store for a free replacement. I went to store the lady kept trying but nothing happened then a answer that oh may be because you bought phone from Amazon and their customer service should take of this.Ha who don't know on this earth that Amazon don't care for customer satisfaction at all. There is no one who can help you. After few emails I lost hopes and now stuck with this phone.Now I think I shouldn't have bought it from here if it was thru Verizon at least I can get new phone.My 2 cents don't buy from here its worth buying from Verizon directly in long term.
2	Overall this is a bad phone. The main reason I purchased it was because it's very thin and has no antenna. The reception is good and voices come in clear both ways. This is where the positives stop. The worst aspect of the phone is the poor battery life. I have even disabled EVDO so it won't switch between it and 1x when moving around town (which drains the battery).The Verizon software makes the phone useless. You cannot have the phone ring and vibrate at the same time you cannot change the horrible wallpaper on the front LCD and you cannot change the color scheme from red. Verizon has also disabled the use of Motorola Phone Tool which enables you to put your own ringtones and media on the phone. You are forced to purchase media from the VCast service. Even if you wouldn't normally use media on your phone you should object to this because of principal. It's corporate greed at its finest and Verizon is preventing you from using the full capabilities of your purchase.It does have a decent camera but it's functionality is limited. It takes video clips but nothing over 15 seconds. There are sites that tell you how to hack the phone but it's not worth the time and risk of ruining the phone.The pluses: very thin no antenna sleek designCons: horrible user interface very few options to change the appearance many of the phone's functionality has been disabled by VerizonConclusion: buy something else. I succumbed to the hype of the Razr but was burned. If it weren't for Verizon the phone would be fine.
2	The WEP200 sounds pretty good is easy to use and is pleasantly small but the system for keeping it in the ear is nearly useless. It comes with three different sizes of these little rubber loop things that are supposed to create enough pressure and friction on the inside of the auricle to keep the device in place but none of them would keep the little thing in my ear it would always fall out.It comes with nice a little case that also serves as the charger.  However this device also a little bit overpriced. So on to the next one.
0	I BOUGHT TWO JUST TO HAVE ONE CHARGING WHILE I USE THE OTHER ONE.BIG MISTAKE!!!  BOTH STOP CHARGING WITH NO REASONSIT WORKS OK JUST FOR A FEW MONTHS.
2	For the price this is a great little headset with good voice quality on both ends.  The negative is that it won't stay in the ear and the ear hook is too flimsy to do any good with hanging it on the ear.
2	I first liked this headset when I got it because of the small size and easy fit without an ear hook. They are reasonably loud and easy to use (volume On/Off & paring). Charging is simple: drop it in its storage charging case and close the lid.But first it is somewhat tiny and so you either need to wear it continually in your ear (hardly cool) or risk it getting lost in a purse. And because it is so smooth it does not hang in a bluetooth carrying loop that I had on my cellphone case (slips out).The dedicated charging case is also very small and has a dedicated charger with a unique charging tip (does not work with a mini USB connector or most other charging hubs)But the most disappointing failure was that the headset would inexplicably disconnect from my AT&T; Tilt in the middle of a call and the re-pairing would need to be done all over again. When you are driving and expecting a hands-free ride this is a pretty serious problem.So I am replacing it and hoping that Samsung has addressed these problems with the well-reviewed WEP470.
0	Keeps flling off ear. does not work past 4 feet. Bought the Jabra 125 and love it
2	This is now the 7th bluetooth headset I've owned and it is far and away the best in terms of quality of call. All the others I've used will start to crackle if I put my phone in my pocket; some drop quality if I hold the phone or place any part of my body between the phone and the earpiece.Because of its size the microphone on the Samsung WEP200 is set far back on the cheek. Despite this challenge the unit still manages to pick up my voice clearly. I receive fewer complaints from those I call.Unfortunately the compact design appears to severely affect the battery potential. After 10 months of moderate use the serviceable charge time of my Samsung has dropped from disappointing to worthless. If turned on but not used the battery will last up to 22 hours. If used to make calls the charge my last as long as 8 full minutes on a good day. This translates to a maximum of about 2 calls per charge. Often I have to switch a call back to the phone to avoid losing power and possibly dropping the call. This is a major detraction from the overall value of a hands-free device.
2	This is a very small unit & the piece that fits in the ear is rather large.  It is a very uncomfortable fit for my adult female ear.  The over the ear loop must be removed for recharging.  The button controls on the surface and sides of the unit are not difficult to use.I would not recommend this unit for anyone with smallish ears or large fingers.
0	The sound garbles badly and the battery runs out within an hour. Very neat looking headset but not functional.
2	After putting myPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technologythrough our washing machine I thought I'd purchase a cheap $20 replacement.  The Plantronics Voyager 510 was a little large but I was always satisfied with the voice quality and fit on my ear.  The Samsung WEP200 does not compare in function to the Voyager 510.  I never could get it to attach to my ear and stay there.  Nor was the sound quality very good.  Overall Samsung makes great LCD TVs and decent printers.  This device like their Blu-Ray players is lacking in function and performance.  I returned it to Amazon for a refund and will buy another Voyager 510.
0	I buy this handsfree. and give me a damaged product...and send me other...and damaged tooo..i buy nokia products and NEVER send me a damaged product.. Where is your Quality department Samsung???Dont buy samsung products!!! please be wise!!!!
2	Good product.  2 hr talk time. It does give you some static noise from time to time.  Overall not bad very small light weight fits in ear comfortably.
2	First the ear clip snapped around the clip that holds it on. Hmm OK I'll replace it.EVERY time that I tried to answer a call with that wondrous one button wonder I disconnected or worse couldn't hear it loud enough. for whatever Allen Funt reason this !#!@?!! thing resets to the lowest audio setting all by itself. It doesn't fit into my ear(s) but sort of hangs over it on that damned cheap earpiece that never held right. Pretty much guaranteed to be a worse distraction while driving than picking up the phone itself: distractingly nonfunctional and some engineer's idea of punking everybody who buys it.This was a replacement for my lost Samsung headset that was a much better product but gone darn it. As such I've relegated THIS absurd farce to a place on a shelf until I can conveniently find a way to extract some measure of revenge on it.
0	I bought this headset on the recommendation of a very picky friend so I figured it would be great. Wrong. The ear loop is cumbersome to put on and the ear bud by itself will not stay in my average ear. Worse you have to place the headset in a recharging box (???? What happened to a simple plug??) meaning that the ear loop needs to come off. A Jabra ear gel fits on the unit . . . but the ear piece needs to come off to recharge. The nail in the coffin is that the ear piece volume is terribly low necessitating a constant shove of a finger to ensure no aural leakage even in my ultra-quiet Toyota Sequoia. To be fair the sound quality was reported to to be very good but the drawbacks far outweigh the pluses.
2	Ok seriously who are the group of dolts at Samsung approving the release of a products like this?  Did they take the time to at least put it in their ear?  I'm writing this because they are making newer models but with zero design improvements.Problem here is not the function or technical aspect it's the design.  I have no idea who's ear this is designed for but it's not for humans.  You would think that with the mention of three ear bud attachments and an ear ring that some type of combination would be a perfect match for anyone.  Not even close.The size is appealing and the storage case charger is great.  It does work well low noise and good range.  However it only has about four hours of use before you need to recharge.  But if you have to balance it in your ear and keep still or hold it it kinda defeats the purpose.  It being so small and falling out ALL the time also leaves you wondering where it went and who is either sitting or stepping on it.So the cheap flimsy useless piece of plastic thing that attaches to the headset has less value than the strip of plastic that you peel off the top of a milk jug cap.  Plus there is no place to put it.  The headset goes in it's case but you are supposed to put this plastic strip thing where exactly?  Certainly not in your pocket as you will mistake it for garbage and throw it out.  That must be where mine is because I have yet to see it in the past few weeks.There are three rubbery ear bud cover things in different sizes.  They have an appending ring that may be there for fitting in your ear or maybe to floss your teeth.  Who knows.  They do nothing and the sad part about all of this is that the best fit is when you don't use any of the included attachments... but it hurts either way.  I had to spend additional money on two different sets of of ear bud covers.  One set were foam-like wraps... useless.  And some type of rubber things that just did not fit.Samsung WEP-301 Bluetooth Headset (Silver)is the newer model but it is not any different in design.  However it's so cheap with rebate it cost less than the freakin' earbud covers I wasted money on.  Therefore after this appealing review and you still want to buy this thing I would go for the newer one.  But don't say I (we!) didn't warn you!NOTE: If you are ok with putting superglue in your ear to keep it attached please disregard this review.
2	It's 2nd headset I had.  I used to have Moto HS850.  WEP200 is better as far as connection; way to operate it.  Easy to carry it around.  It doesn't solid stay in my ear even I used the largest loop. So I won't always put it in my ear only when there is a call. The voice is clear in in-door or inside the car with windows up.  Noise cancelling is not as good as HS850.  When I walk on the street in a little windy climate the other party start complaining the noise.  This is what Samsung needs to find the way to improve it.
0	Ordered this thing on Sep 19th.  It did not ship until Oct 26th!  And don't even get me started about the stupid reasons customer service gave as to why an In STOCK item took that long to ship.  Anyway I finally got it.  I was so excited because of the great reviews I read.  When I saw the ear hook I was like WHAT!  This is a flimsy piece of cr@p!  I thought to myself This is going to break as soon as I use it so I had better just leave it on.  Then to my utter AMAZEMENT!  YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF TO CHARGE THE DUMB THING!  After the second charge guess what?  IT BROKE!  Big surprise!  Now I have to hold the unit to my ear to use it or if will fall out.  Not that the ear hook was all that great the thing still fell off even when it had the ear hook.  I can't really comment about how well the thing works because I can't keep it charged.  After the first complete charge it died after one phone call.  It was about an hour phone call but gee whiz!  This is my 5th bluetooth ear piece so I have a little experience with these things.  My biggest complaint with the others was low speaker volume and noise interference.  I wish I would have had the chance to test this one out but it's going back to Amazon.  Maybe I should file an RMA and then wait a month and a half to ship it back to them. LOL!
2	this thing isn't comfortable at all...and doesn't stay on my ear worth a darn.It has good connection quality...but I can barely use it.
2	Was helpful but could have been shaped better to not cause the talk button of the headset to be pressed so easily.
2	This product looks nicer in the picture than in person.  The quality is not as nice.  Also I agree with the other reviewers that the fit is a bit too tight and can sometimes turn on the headset.  It's ok for the price but I would definitely try to find another alternative.
0	This case is worthless with my Motorola HS815 headset.  Every time I put the headset in the case the case squeezes the activation button on the headset.  Maybe it will work with headsets that do not have the activation button on the outside surface.
2	I have gone through three HS850 Motorola headsets. After the first one expired--largely due to the inability to recharge brought on by exposure to pockets etc.--I bought two BLT-04 cases to take care of the replacement headset I got. At first the case seemed to be a godsend. It fit perfectly and clipped on effortlessly. Then I realized that it also clipped off just as effortlessly. I figured I'd be careful enough and kept the case. While packing boxes for moving I did not notice that clip slipped off and fell into one of the boxes along with the headset. By the time I realized what happened all the boxes were packed sealed and ready to go to storage. It's not as bad as losing the set on a street but still I am unable to use it until boxes get unpacked. Luckily the price dripped from $80+ for the headset to around $30 and I did not hesitate to get a replacement. But I am not putting it into the case--it's safer in my pocket.
2	I bought the BLT-04 case to use with the Motorola H700 headset.  It fits the headset very nicely but..  But the design of the case does not prevent the  multifunction button from being pushed if the case is at all squeezed even though there is a recess in the case cover you'd think would prevent that.  The result is that I'd often find the pairing light on and the battery close to drained.If you are going to clip the case on a shirt pocket it might be ok though even the tension of the elastic of the case is enough to push the headset button.  If the case will be put inside a briefcase or purse then you should probably reconsider.
2	i tried this headset with a samsung upstage and a nokia n75....before this headset only used two kind of motorolla headset.nokia is louder! and its stays in place so u can hillclimb... riding a bike.. joging whatever... it will stay on your ears = wont come off! BUT!! IT IS uncomfortable! i had to change side every hours because the headset hurt my ears after a while.but... the line still breaking up all the time if im not using it in a car or a room or a hall... if i step out with this headset ( paired with whatever kind of phone) from a car or room out to the street all the voice is gonna break up.. it is NOT the phones.. its the headset or the technology.. same thing= we wont be satisfied....so if u looking for something wich is comfy and good.. buy another nokia headset.. if u need a headset because u are a sportman.. then this is your headset!!!!!!
2	This is a very comfortable headset and was quite easy to set up with my Motorola phone.  The sound quality is as good as other headsets I've used and people on the other end of a call have told me that my voice is clearer.  However I'm VERY disappointed with how poor the battery life has been.  I get less than 1 hour of talk time and less than 48 hours of standby time.  I could go over a week with my old Nokia bluetooth headset.
2	Unlike Motorola and Cardo bluetooth units this one actually goes into your ear like the handsfree wire that probably came with your phone. Since the Motorola and Cardo simply hang free once the ear loop is draped over your ear it ensures the ear loop is sitting atop your ear. In the case of the Soyo FreeStyler 500 once the ear piece is inserted into my ear the loop actually hangs above my ear and the bluetooth falls off. If you're not following me here just be aware that if your ears are small to average this may not be the bluetooth for you. There is also an option to not wear it over your ear and in fact I may try that but I'm not sure that option is any better than just using the included handsfree wire that came with my phone. The flashing is pretty annoying but all of my bluetooth units have had that so I get used to it. It charged up quickly and has been holding charge very well. I like the fact that the volume is controlled by two seperate controls. Volume up is on the top of the bluetooth and the volume down is on bottom of the bluetooth unlike my Motorola and Cardo units. I am pleased with the price and the sound quality so 3 stars. Maybe in the future Soyo can include 2 sets of ear loops so everyone will be able to use this bluetooth.
2	Well I went ahead and bought this at the reduced price. It was good at first and then other people were having problems hearing me and I was misunderstood because of this headset. Thankfully it wasn't one of my important calls and just resulted in a bit of confusion between that person and me. I am returning this product because it is just not worth it to me if the other person cannot hear me properly. I do like the design of it and the fact that you get to choose how you place it in your ear. I don't care about it otherwise.
2	The Motorola H350 bluetooth headset is one of the cheaper models out there and it shows.PAIRINGThe H350 pairs like most bluetooth headsets. Tell your phone to search for headsets then hold down the H350 main button for about 10 seconds. Your phone finds the H350 and you hit ok. This works as expected and is no different from any other bluetooth headset. I've used this headset with my Motorola RAZR and Uniden landline bluetooth-capable phone.COMFORT/DESIGNThe H350 has an earclip that easily pops off so that you can fit the headset onto either ear. The clip itself is flexible rubber and while it seems moderately comfortable at first I find my ear starts to hurt after about 30 minutes. Ideally I do not want to notice or feel that I'm wearing a headset. I definitely cannot say that about the H350. The speaker lightly rests over your ear canal. There are two volume buttons on the top and bottom of the headset to increase decrease or mute the speaker.SOUND QUALITYI've tried quite a few headsets out there from Plantronics Motorola and Jabra to compare. Most of them have some deficiencies and the H350 is no different. People on the other end of my conversations state that while my voice is clear it sounds a little far-away. I also think that the highest volume ability of the H350 speaker on my end is still too weak (yes I have perfectly normal hearing). When you max out the speaker volume the sound becomes a bit distorted and it's still not loud enough to clearly hear the other caller while driving in a car even with the windows all the way up. This is in stark contrast to the Plantronics 640-665 series which have jelly earpieces that comfortably squish into your ear canal for optimal volume and clarity. As a result I can only recommend the H350 for home use where there isn't alot of background noise present.OVERALLAt it's basic level the Motorola H350 bluetooth headset works. You maintain a good connection between it and your phone within 10-12 feet (like any other functional headset). However it's shortcomings in volume and mic quality cannot be overlooked. I only recommend this headset if you plan on using it at home or in the office and only if you got it for a great price. If you need higher quality you may want to open your wallet a little more and look into that Plantronics 640-665 line.
2	Did not work well with my phone.
2	This was ok people heard me ok but the piece kept slipping off my ear.  It took a lot of coordination to keep the earpiece on my ear.
2	This bluetooth was my first and worst. I couldn't hear alot on it and it didn't stay on my ear for nothing. I would stay away.
0	I used to have a Motorola H500 which worked well for my phone. Unfortunately I misplaced it. So I eventually bought another one via Amazon. When I got it it worked but had a hissing and crackle sound. I thought it was my phone and the problem would eventually go away. It did not. This was suppose to be a brand new headset. It's defective and I did not return it immediately. So I'm giving this supplier a 1 star.
2	Item was purchased to replace a Motorola 300 headset. Worked ok but paired fast. Volume was ok but could have been louder. Biggest drawbacks were callers could barely hear me if I was not using my 'outside' voice which is annoying to others around you. The other complaint is the fit. I still do not understand how Motorola engineers enjoy this design. It feels like it is going to fall off and on occasion does. Item was returned within 30 day policy of where it was purchased. Here is where I am at currently with headsets....this is my review for the cardo scala 700lx that I currently own and am very happy with so far. I feel the cardo is a better unit for comperable price.My first bluetooth was a Motorola. I have not been happy with the Motorola fit as it feels like it is going to fall off...and on occasions it has. I am also replacing the motorola because I now have 2 cell phones I need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously. To replace it I found a great deal on a Jabra BT5010. Great headset so good my wife stole it. Went to buy another and the price had gone back up. I tend to lose or damage things so I have set a budget of no more than $30-$40. I then found a deal on a Jabra BT5020. I had received a bad unit and the exchange from another buy.ing website went bad and finally received my money back. Again went to buy another and the price had gone up. This led me to the Cardo 700lx.First off the fit is by far the best of the 3 I have had. I can honestly say I have forgotten it was on and it can startle you when a call comes in. After 5-10 minutes you dont even notice it on at all. Extremely light weight. A 5 star in my book. Where as the motorola is a 1 star the BT5010 is a 3 star and the BT5020 is a 3.5 star.Next is ease of use. I like the placement of buttons. The main button on front has a definate click to it so you know you have pressed it and doesn't leave you guessing. The rocker volume dial on back is great for adjusting volume and can be reversed if placing on your left ear so rocking up is always louder and rocking down is quieter. Pressing the dial in also has function as well. Neat simple design and easy to access with larger fingers. Again 5 star.Finally is funtionality. This is where I have to question my rating. I know this is not a $50 headset $75 headset or even a $100+ headset and wont rate it/compare it to such. I understand you get what you pay for. With that said here is my humble opinion. The headset has great volume and sounds as good as using the phone itself. However the range is not as good at the others I have used. The Headset operates best with the phone in sight. Static is noticed by the caller (not me) if the phone is on my body the opposite of each other. In the car it is best to place in the right ear and the phone in the center console or passenger seat. If you want to use it in the left ear the phone should be on that side. Same side line of sight distance is approximately 10-12 feet before static comes in for the caller. Call quality is always good on my end however again the caller definately knows you are on a headset as it does have a slight echo. Again I know this is not an expensive headset and is not perfect. But no caller has complained when asked. Some didn't even know I was on a headset. Background noise is an issue for the caller though. One does need to close the windows turn down/off the radio lower the HVAC fan for a quality business conversation.Final note comes to the multiple bluetooth pairing function. The main feature I was looing for was having a headset that would work with 2 phones. Since I carry a personal phone and a work phone I want to answer and use both without changing phones or settings. The Jabra's were good but voice recognition redialing and funcions only worked with the last phone paired up. That means if you wanted to use the 1st phone you connected you had to find the phone and manually use it. Not bad if it is seldom used. As for me I use each phone equally. This headset allows you to double tap the volume rocker to switch between each phone. Great feature that allows full function use of each phone. The only drawback is that only one phone is 'active' at a time on the headset. Meaning if you are talking on phone 'A' and then hang up...minutes later phone 'B' rings you do not hear it in your headset and must listen for the phones ringer/vibrate. Then once you hear the other phone ring you double tap the volume rocker to switch over to the phone 'B'. A drawback to be able to use full function of 2 phones. In the Jabra's the headset would ring for each phone without doing anything (great) but voice dialing was only for the last phone paired.Added benefits include not having to by accessories. It come in the box with a wall charger car charger usb charger and a belt/carry pouch.In conclusion great headset for $30. In that price range (under $50??) it is a 5 star. Is there better out there. Certainly. But you have to double if not triple the price. For $30.00 I am extremely happy and would recommend it to others.
0	It acted as thought it was muted when it wasn't. I tried it on two separate cell phones and it did the same thing on both phones. The person being called could hear the first syllable and that was it. I did try to turn the mute off all it did was change the frequency of the buzzing sound the other person heard.
0	While I will agree that the device works as advertised and the sound quality is pretty decent this headset has caused me more heartache in annoyances to outweigh any benefit.  If you buy this be prepared for the device to turn on and off at very in opportune times.....  but if you want to turn it off thats a whole different story.  Powering the device on and off requires holding the button down for a certain period of time but the problem is that the time required seems to change each time you do it.  Add to this that holding the button down for a period of time shorter than the period of time required to turn it off is actually a redial function.  I have FREQUENTLY called someone just by trying to turn off the device.  The button is also entirely too sensitive.  I've had the device in my cargo pants pocket (where this would be very little pressure on the device) and the unit has turned on and actually called someone.Other issues are the charging indication isn't real clear and there isn't any idea of knowing how charged the battery is and the device isn't quite as comfortable as other devices that I have used (its bearable but there is definately more comfortable for the money).
2	Product is fine only problem i talk at a good level for people to hear me over the blue tooth and they have trouble hearing me and frequesnt clicks and pops occur. Besides that great product
2	It is easy to use and set up but quickly went out of style. The black coloring is nice and the blue light button is easy to use.
2	I don't think anyone makes a long-life battery for the old Motorolla RAZR flip phones.  Its a shame because this is the only flaw I have experienced with them.
2	It fits the phone but has a crappy cheap feel to it.  It collects fingerprints and doesn't seem to do anything but add bulk to an already large phone.
2	It's standard protection nothing more!! It easily peels off of the phone with the slightest bit of pressure.But it does offer some protection.
2	This case is ok  but there are certainly better ones out there for cheaper.I ordered this case with high expectation thinking i was going to recieve a brand name product from Boxwave  instead i recieved a generic case with no branding .There are other cases here on amazon and other sites that are exactly the same thing i recieved for less then half the price this one is being sold for.For some reason my comments doesnt get approved im not sure why  just letting you all know my personal experience with this transaction .
2	Pros:  Works as it should. Easy connection to the phone.  Good talk time. Comfortable fit on the ear.  Easy to use.One Con: I could use this headset without any problems. My wife would get bad echo issues where the person she was talking with heard themselves as an echo.  Guess it has to do with the fit to the ear.  In my case the path from the earpiece to the mike was blocked but open in her case.  She had the same issue with a Motorola H500 earpiece and i can use the same Motorola earpiece fine.Purchased a Plantronics 510 which works for her.  No reports of echo from the person she is talking with.
2	I sold my Discovery 650 and upgraded to the 655 because I thought the DSP would cut the noise in the car.  Boy was I disappointed.  Not only did it sound a lot worse to people on the other end but it sounded a lot more choppy on my receiving end as well.It stays in my ear fairly well even without the ear loop -- just the eargel.  BUT...The eargels unclip too easily when in a pocket bag or ESPECIALLY when in the pocket-clip charger.  If I have it clipped on my pocket the eargel faces out and unavoidably rotates to its removal position.  When I brush up against anything the eargel flips out.  I've lost two eargels now and it just sits in a drawer.They should have designed a better retention mechanism on the eargel with some kind of positive release mechanism and/or have the eargel facing back when it's in the clip in a pocket so it won't get torn off.I also hated the force required on the buttons.  I never used the volume controls (always did it from the phone) and I dreaded getting calls because I'd have to MASH the answer button into my head.One more thing -- It's always getting unpaired from my Treo 680.  I have to go through the Treo menus to get it to pair again.  To be honest this may have to do with the Treo more than the headset but the two do not like each other that well.The Discovery 650 without the DSP had much better audio quality slightly lighter force on the buttons but the same problems with eargels getting torn off in my pocket.--- UPDATE ---I called Plantronics tech support and they immediately sent me out new eargels.  So I'm using it again.
0	I thought this thing would be great because it was so small and I could use my normal chargers with it but it broke soon after I bought it.
2	I bought this for around $70 here on amazon after reading the reviews on cnet etc.  It was their highest-rated bluetooth headset.  It works but it could be much much better.First I think technology still has a long way to go with regards to bluetooth/wireless headsets.  Sound quality on this thing while loud enough made everyone sound like they were talking through several layers of tshirts. Everyone I've spoken to on this says they can tell I'm on something but that I sound fine.  Fine isn't good enough for me.Let's talk design: It absolutely excels in the Cool department - it looks slick and isn't some chubby ear thing.  But with that cool looking factor comes a lose and ill-fitting earpiece.  Yes it comes with 3 replacable earpieces but none fit me quite right. I would like to offer this suggestion to all who own/consider owning this: When you are trying to insert this into your ear take your hand opposite the side of the ear you are putting this in grab the top of your earlobe and pull up while twisting this thing into your ear canal. I got it to fit OK but walking around with it - it feels like it's going to fall out any second.The buttons: Yes they are small but we are all aware that as technology shrinks so are the buttons. Yes they are difficult to use but I'm used to it and you should be too.  Main problem: Is that you really have to press down for the buttons to click and this thing is already ready to fall out of your ear so trying to slam on a button isn't helping.  Why someone doesn't put a nice little trackwheel for volume on one of these things is beyond me.You can walk around with this but you'll want to keep your phone nearby - I walked into the next room not more than 10 feet from the phone and it got static etc.  Pretty weak if you ask me.It works OK. It paired up with my Motorolla KRZR just fine and works no problem. I wonder if the Motorolla headsets work better with Motorola phones.The main reason I got it is for when I drive because I don't like being on my cell while driving and everyone seems to want to call me when I'm driving.  For that purpose it is acceptable.  I guess my expectations are too high for this technology... again.
0	Product came without shipping slip no protective packaging. .Bluetooth was placed in a plastic bag slipped in an envelope and mailed.  Quality is very poor.  Crackling buzzing muffled sounds very annoying and diapointing to recieve something you are expecting to use all the time to not being able to use it.  I would not recomend this vendor to anyone.  Description stated very clearly that it would be packaged in retai packaged and pictured with extra items.  This came with bluetooth only and charge cord; no instruction or any other accessories with this.
0	Although weight sound and battery are good I really dislike this headset's design. If you are a totally predictable person who does the same thing every day and never gets dirt on your cuffs it's ok. If you are on the go the wire clip will come loose in your pocket or in your computer bag. The pen holder doesn't do anything to shield the clip in fact it adds weight that causes more force against the exposed headset. I had to recrimp the loop to make it tight enough not to come loose. The pen cap itself is required baggage for no good reason. Rather than give you a standard mini usb connector on the device you must now haul this cap everywhere. Hey I don't always wear a shirt with pockets. After two weeks I misplaced it on a trip and so the expensive headset is sitting on the shelf while I ponder whether to buy another useless pen clip or to cook up my own connector. There is no excuse for non-standard connectors and charging solutions but watch this company do it over again.(several months later) I finally am tossing out this headset. The pen clip holder was eventually found and I tried to make a go with this device. I don't like to get rid of working items but I have had the earpiece and ear hook fall off many times in my pocket and this last time they fell elsewhere and are lost. Would you believe it couldn't even stand up to the pressure of the inside of my suit coat? I did get a box to carry it in but that was cumbersome because of the charging holder and now it doesn't matter because I would have to buy a new hook and earpiece. Just ordered a Motorola H500 lower cost lots of color choices and very long talk time PLUS a standard mini USB jack. I got a travel case for less than $4. Got one for my daughter for Xmas and she proved it to be a better headset.
2	When I saw pictures and read the details about this Plantronics Discovery 655 DSP Bluetooth headset I just knew I would have to have one.  I have owned several Bluetooth headsets in the past most made by Motorola and I have always continued looking for something that would stay in place and sound good to both myself and the people that I call.  I just can't seem to find a Bluetooth wireless headset that shines in all of the important areas.  They either fit lousy or sound lousy or both!  This new headset from Plantronics looked to be the answer to my search for near perfection.  It is very lightweight fits snug in my ear and has a very impressive appearence.  It even comes with a multitude of charging accessories to allow you to charge from a standard 110 volt household outlet charge from a USB port on a home or office computer and even charge from a single AAA alkaline battery.  The headset provides very good tonal sound quality to the user and the sound output is quite good for the person on the other end of the conversation.  What more could a person want from a wireless headset?  How about decent phone to headset reception?  Even with my Motorola Razr V3 and Razr MaxxVE cellular phones clipped to the belt around my waist I still experience constant reception problems.  There is noticeable crackling and popping sounds and sometimes brief cutout of the conversation.  Although the people on the other end of my conversations say that they notice only slight flaws in the sound I find the amount of noise in the reception to be distracting and very annoying.  The proximity of my phone to the headset doesn't seem to be the problem at all.  Most of the time the headset is less than 3 feet from the cell phone it is paired with.  I have tried the headset with both my work phone and personal phone as well as with my wife's phone.  Changing phones has no effect on the reception problems.  To add further frustration the headset does not work properly with the voice-dial feature of my phones.  All of my previous Bluetooth headsets would allow you to push the call button which would prompt the cell phone to activate the voice-dialing feature.  This Plantronics model requires you to manually activate the voice-dial feature from the telephone itself or to punch in the phone number yourself.  This really prevents me from using the headset as a safer means of calling from my car while traveling.  I constantly receive compliments from friend and coworkers regarding how sleek the headset looks.  But that just doesn't offset all of the shortcomings this headset has in terms of reception and functionality.  The Plantronics Discovery 655 has a great look and an abundance of extras that are included in the package.  However if you are looking for reliable Bluetooth headset that will offer great sound and above average reception then I would recommend that you look elsewhere.  I still give this item an overall rating of 3 stars because of its design lightweight comfortable fit and variety of charging options.  They just need to give it better compatability with hands-free voice dialing and much stronger Bluetooth communication with the cell phone it is paired with.
2	The ear piece always pops off when I put the ear hook on.  I had to send the first one back because it wouldn't turn off.  I have the replacement and still have the ear hook issue and it doesn't stay in my ear without it.  I'll be buying another bluetooth but this will do for the time between ordering.
0	The sound is horrible in the car.  My fiancee said that it sounded like there were bubbling noises when I was talking to her via the headset.  So I called my home and left a message on my answering machine.  Horrible!  I could hardly hear myself over what sounded like bubbles in a fish tank.  Garbage.  Your mileage may vary but I would highly recommend you consider a different headset.
2	I purchased the 655 after reading a glowing review on cnet.  I had read a lot of reviews on multiple sites that indicated that a lot of bluetooth headsets didn't provide a clear signal.  Based on the cnet review I assumed the 655 was different.This being my first bluetooth headset I'm not exactly sure what the standard is.  However the Plantronics literature for this model clearly states that users will have 33 feet to roam.  In my experience using a Blackberry 8700g this is just false.  I get a clear signal 8 to 10 feet away from my phone.  After that the static kicks in and and increases dramatically as the distance increases.  Maybe Plantronics is just copying the hyperbole of other manufactuers.  NonethelessI'm not sure if I would have purchased this model if I had known that I was limited to 10 feet at most.With that said I do find that reception is very clear within the 8 foot range.  Also the volume control is excellent.  I found it easier to hear voices with the 955 than anything I'd experienced with a dozen corded headsets.The accessories are probably the biggest selling point.  The 955 comes with three earpieces and can be recharged via a AAA battery USB or with a provided electrical adapter.If you're looking for a bluetooth set that provides clear reception beyond 10 feet (like they claim they're supposed to) then I wish you luck.  As of late 2006 based on reviews I've read I wasn't able to find a single headset that gave that kind of reception.  It seems that bluetooth headsets are not yet ready for prime time.
2	I am replacing this headset (It replaced an Explorer 320) with a 510 because I am sick and tired of swivel earhooks getting loose and falling off-which is apparently NOT a warranty issue according to Plantronics. Their recommendation? Replace the headset. I ordered my 510 tonight-can't wait to replace this one. Note-it drops calls frequently which I know is a cell-phone company issue because it happens with the phone too. But the swivel earpieces are ridiculous. I could have bought a 520 for $2 more but chose not to because of the SWIVEL!
0	I really don't have a lot of time. That is why I shop online So if I'm purchasing an item that is to be used to make life more convenient like a Bluetooth headset it really is obnoxious to receive one that is &#34;worse than sucks&#34;. This item did not even charge. Plantronics really needs to pull this item because it is really damaging to their reputation to have this out there for sale. I choose Plantronics because as a Regional Sales Manager/Road Warrior I've always had luck with Plantronics. Too bad that this one was a lemon.
2	It's a fairly good headset. Negatives: does a poor job of screening out wind noise & other noises; when I make a 2nd call it doesn't always find the phone & I have to punch a few buttons to get it working again.Positives: very comfortable - I forget I have it on; fairly discreet looking; battery life is very good; hooks up to my phone (Treo 700p) seamlessly - I very rarely have to pair it up again; I can hear very well even in my noisy diesel pickup!
2	The sound quality is fine... as long as you keep your phone no further from the earpiece than your shirt pocket. This thing has NO range to it. It's unfortunate because it has an otherwise solid design. The single rocker switch is slick and intuitive. All the design in the world doesn't mean a lick if it just doesn't work.
2	I originally bought this headset for my wife (her first BT headset) because she didn't like the look of myPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology [Retail Packaged]. She found the 330 painfully uncomfortable and decided to sacrifice style for comfort (quite a departure from her typical choices particularly regarding footwear); thus she is now enjoying my 510 and I'm getting by with the 330. I don't find the 330 uncomfortable for the first few hours but I never forget it's in my ear like I did with the 510. If you have very small ears it's probably a bad choice.Here's a brief comparison between the two with my 5 point ratings:STYLE & DESIGNI greatly prefer the 330's single side button that makes it very easy adjust the volume. On the 510 I found the volume and power buttons behind the ear difficult to reach and easy to confuse - probably my biggest complaint with the 510.I prefer the look and size of the 330. It's more modern and discreet. However it's not a fashion accessory and everyone looks like a dork with a flashing blue light next to their ear with any BT headset. I wish people would realize this and take these things off in public (especially in restaurants). I only use mine in the car or when at the computer so this is the least important criteria for me.COMFORTThe 510 is the clear winner here for both me and my wife. Everyone's ear is different and I find the 330 less uncomfortable than my wife did. A few may find the 330 fits them better than the 510 but the 510 includes 3 ear pieces to provide a custom fit.PERFORMANCEThis is the best reason to get the 510. I've used worse headsets than the 330 but none better than the 510. With the 330 I get static if the phone is on the other side of body from the headset. The 330's claimed 30' range - maybe at high altitude with no obstructions no other radio interference with no solar flares and a full moon - real world more like 10' with no obstructions.Noise canceling is far superior on the 510. People would never guess I was using a headset - usually they couldn't even tell when I was in my car. The 330 is about useless in a windy environment and picks up a lot of background noise.Both headsets seem to have very good battery life and audio quality for listening. The 510 also has the advantage of being able to pair with 2 devices simultaneously but I've never tried this feature.STYLE & DESIGN330 - 4510 - 2COMFORT330 - 3510 - 5PERFORMANCE330 - 3510 - 5FEATURES & PRICE330 - 4  (probably better than most headsets &lt; $30)510 - 5  (more expensive but worth it for features and performance)OVERALL330 - 3510 - 5The comfort and performance of the 510 justify the extra $16.
2	I purchased this unit primarily to use with my MacBook and Skype for conducting business calls.  Previously I was using the Logitech Clear Chat Pro wired USB headset with very good results but after breaking a couple of them by accidentally yanking the cords from my Mac I wanted to try a wireless solution.  So far the results have been mixed.  Here are some highlights:1. Build Quality - 3 starsThe build quality seems pretty good especially for something in this price range.  The construction is mostly all plastic but the hinge mechanisms and stress points appear to be adequately constructed.  I would NOT expect these headsets to stand up to much abuse - e.g. extensive travel where they are jammed in and out of a bag dropped on the ground etc.  For daily office or home use where they are place into a drawer or on a desk when not in use they should give a good service life.  People have complained that the foam earpieces fall off but after a couple weeks of use I have not seen any indications of this problem.  The switches all operate smoothly and while the overall design is a bit clunky that is more an aesthetic comment than a quality comment.2. Features - 4 starsThe headset has a good feature set supporting both the stereo headphone profile (A2DP) and the headset profile.  I have used these with both my Mac and my iPhone and with the Mac both profiles work with easy switching between the two using the Bluetooth Preferences drop down for on-the-fly changes.  With the iPhone only the headset profile is supported (this is an iPhone limitation NOT a limitation of this headset).  Buttons for volume skip/fast forward skip/fast rewind work well with iTunes on the laptop.  Only the volume controls and call answer/end buttons seem to work with the iPhone in the headset mode.3. Operation/usage  - 2 starsPairing with both the Mac and the iPhone was absolutely seamless and switching between the two is fairly straightforward though I have not tried to have the headset paired and connected to both devices - I'm not sure this works.  For now I disable Bluetooth on my iPhone when it is nearby and I want to pair the PT590 to my Macbook because otherwise the PT590 will connect to its last device which is usually my iPhone when on the road.  The comfort of these headphones is so-so - the ear pads are relatively small and the over-the-head band is quite tight (and I have a small head).  I can imagine that they would be quite uncomfortable for anyone with a large melon.  Stretching the band would be dangerous since it is made of plastic and would probably break.  perhaps heating it with a blow dryer and gently stretching it out might work...  The foam ear pads are thin and since the ear pieces press pretty firmly against the head they do cause minor discomfort after some period of time.  They are no where near as comfortable as my Bose QCII headphones but these are $60 and the Bose are $300 so I would expect that to be the case.  They are more comfortable than other headphones I have had in this &lt;$100 price range including both wired and wireless units.  I would not recommend them for all-day use sitting at a desk (get the Bose and live with the wires) but for short stints they are great.The blue light is annoying but it is also an important status indicator for things like call status and battery life.  It is one of the ways my wife knows when I am on a call in my office when she walks in to talk to me.Operating the unit is very easy - answering a call you touch a button the same button ends the call. For listening to music the controls are a bit less intuitive - the top and bottom buttons skip forward or reverse and the front and rear buttons increase or decrease the volume - this seems like it was not thought out very well as the functions between the two pairs of buttons should be swapped to be more intuitive.The pull-out boom for the mic is a nice feature and there is a built-in wind screen.  I have not tried these units in windy conditions but would expect their performance to exceed many other mini headsets for mobile phone usage.One nit I have is that in order to get the boom mic to point down towards one's mouth the headband needs to sit pretty far forward on the head - it feels slightly unnatural.  So this leaves you with the choice of either tilting the whole setup forward to angle the mic towards the mouth or put them on feeling more natural but have the mic pointed up at one's nose/cheek.Note:  I use these headphones alongside a logitech bluetooth mouse and have been surprised at how little interference there is between the two.  Occasionally my mouse will freeze but a click will usually quickly restore service to the mouse.  There is no static induced in the headphones by the mouse that I can discern.4. Performance - 4 stars for music  2 stars for SkypeOverall performance of these units is quite good with the exception of VOIP or Skype calling.4.1 Music - music sounds surprisingly full and rich given that these units are small and rather flimsy feeling (e.g. lightweight).  The are on the ear style headphones so they do not offer any passive noise reduction and the sound leakage from the outside into the ears as well as from the 'phones to the outside is pretty significant (I can't watch a movie on my laptop in bed while my wife is trying to sleep - something I do routinely with my Bose QCII headphones).  But for average music listening they are really surprisingly good.  By tweaking the EQ settings you can get them to sound as good or better than many wired headphones in this price range and the amount of stutter or static is surprisingly low.4.2 Skype - 1 star - I cannot recommend these units for Skype - Out use.  This may be a limitation of Bluetooth for VOIP calling as I have not tried other Bluetooth sets the amount of lag introduced by these units is unacceptable for business-level conversation.  I know that this is not a limitation of Skype as I previously used a wired Logitech headset with very good results with Skype.  The lag can vary in severity but even at its best it is noticeable - almost like talking to someone over a satellite connection where there is several hundred milliseconds of delay.  It can get annoying very quickly.  At its worst it is totally unusable as people I am talking to hear nothing but static and garbled speech.  I have reached the point where I really only use them when I am on long conference calls where I just have to listen for 95% of the time.  For real calls I have had to go back to using my cell phone.4.3 Phone - 5 stars - probably the best quality audio (both mic and speakers) that I have used with my iPhone or my Motorola Razr.  The headphones are big and dorky looking while walking through an airport but boy they sure stay on your head when you lean over to pick up your bag and they seem to do a great job of filtering out background noise.Overall the performance of these units is very good for the price.  If you are buying them for music and /or for use with a phone (especially one that supports the A2DP profile)  I highly recommend them - you cannot beat the performance at this price point.  For use with Skype at a desktop computer I cannot recommend them and suggest you use a wired USB or audio jack type headset.
0	This product is junk. Had it less than a month and it stopped working. Dont waste your money.
2	The  sound  was  great  but  the headphones  were  poorly  constructed  and they  broke. The  headphones  have a  really  annoying &#34;police like&#34;  blue  light.  The  light  disturbed  others  around me.
2	I have used these headsets for more than 2 years with my iPod classic and a variety of Bluetooth cell phones. They are easy to pair feel comfortable and the sound quality is very good. Battery life is fairly long - for my use almost a week. The Bluetooth adapter that comes with 590A fits very snugly into the iPod 3.5 mm audio jack (unlike many others). Telescopic microphone is unobtrusive works well on cell phones and the listeners at other end don't complain of poor voice quality.The main drawback of these headsets is their flimsy construction cheap plastic. One of the cables became loose after a year and the plastic casing on one side cracked. So the sound from one side is intermittent now. Other cons include tiny and poorly placed controls - almost unusable while wearing headsets very bright blue light and they do not cover the ears completely so there is no blockage of background sound.They are not the perfect Bluetooth headphones but in my experience they have worked better than the other ones that I have tried - iLUV 903 and Logitech
2	I bought the 590's because they're one of the few bluetooth stereo headphones that get overall good reviews both at Amazon and tech websites like CNET.  I've had mine for about a week.  I want to use them for music listening and Skype calls through my computer.So far I can only get them to work as stereo headphones.  In that respect they sound very good.However I'm unable to get them working as a phone headset with my computer.  The problem is the microphone.  When I try Skype's test call I can hear the lady speak but Skype cannot hear me speak.On my Windows XP laptop I can connect the 590's as  'stereo headphones' or as a 'hands free headset with microphone'.  After connecting as a headset I hear odd beeps about every 5 seconds.  The beep pattern is not described in Plantronics' skimpy User's Manual.I've configured my computer's sound system to use bluetooth for playing and recording audio.  I've tried pressing the 590's Phone and Mute buttons to unmute the microphone but nothing seems to work.I'll call their support number to try and make the 590's work for Skype calls.  I hope they work out because they're light and sound great.
2	This was worth the priceearpiece volume is great no problem hearing incoming voice.  The only problem is that the mic is so far away from my mouth (as a result of such a compact product) that in order to have good voice transmission I must hold my hand up and cup it from the corner of my mouth to the earpiece so my voice can be heard clearly.  This product would be perfect if it the mic portion extended a couple inches further towards the mouth.
2	Very flimsy cheap product.  Takes 8 seconds MINIMUM to turn On/Off.  Battery life only a couple days.  I sure expected better from the previous reviews.
2	I have been a satisfied Virgin Mobile (VM) customer for several years happily using an Audiovox 8500.  VM uses the SPRINT cellular network which has a strong signal in my area.Lets talk about the SLICE which is made by UTSTARCOM.  I was very much attracted to this thin stylish cell phone.  I am not going to waste any time - what you see is what you get.  It is basically a pretty phone with very good reception but the outgoing voice quality is below average.  The person on the other end will think you are swallowing water while talking.  Another issue is the cramped key pad.This cell phone reminds me of a pretty girl with the voice of cartoon character.  If you prize fashion over function - go for it.I am switching back to my AUDIOVOX.P.S.  You will feel compelled to purchase additional wallpaper for an additional $2 because what comes on the phone as standard fare is ugly!
2	Picked this up from Radio Shack as a novelty item.  The phone is thin but the call quality is quite poor.  Virgin Mobile uses Sprint's PCS network and Sprint is my primary provider (I have a new Sanyo M1 phone) and the call quality difference is huge.  The keypad is also uncomfortable to use like many ultra-thin phones -- just not designed for normal human beings IMHO.  Finally VM's prepaid rate is just too high.  Coupled with limited coverage I'd say VM's service is a bad deal.
2	I have had this phone for 2 months now.First the GoodSize Call Quality User Interface Volume Virgin pricing plans web extras.It is very thin and can be stuck in any pocket without making it look like you just shoplifted half the store. The call quality has been excellent much like my 2 previous phones from sprint were (Virgin runs off of the Sprint PCS network for those who didn't know). The interface is clean and simple for anyone to use. The volume of the call is loud and clear as is the ringer - I have yet to not hear the phone ringing in my pocket (one of my biggest problems with my last Samsung phone). Virgin has really simple pre-paid pricing plans with a well organized and useful website. Virgin offers lots of ringtones and wallpaper online at 2 bucks a pop as well as celebrity voice mail & rescue ringtones.Now the badButton size battery life built in extras.The buttons are very small and can be difficult to operate if you have large hands (Once the phone book is programmed this becomes much less of an issue). This phone will not stay charged for more than 1 day - even if no calls are made. I have to make sure I charge it every night or else it becomes useless - this is my biggest complaint about this phone. There are hardly any backgrounds or ringtones that come with the phone. I had to go online and pay more for a ringtone than I would for an entire song from iTunes.
2	Works well.  Ear buds tend to fall out easily when moving too much.  Price is right though.
2	I bought these for a LG LX600. You get good sound but the length of the wires is awful. Not only is one side longer than the other but if you keep the phone in your pocket the cords aren't long enough. And they really put a limit on the volume.
2	This charger just wouldn't charge... probably it was not chosen well but at most....could have been used as was anticipated........
0	When it arrived I went to plug it in and noticed one of the prongs was bent. I went to bend it back and it broke! Then I noticed rust at the base of the broken prong. I'm sending it back for a refund and won't be buying another one.
0	Does not work with iPhone 3GS at all. First time I tried it it said Accessory not optimized for iPhone. I think Amazon should remove the listing.
0	DO NOT buy this charger. You will probably never see this review because nobody wants you to know what this charger will do to your Apple device!! It will destroy it!
2	This is a nice concept.  It allows the holster to orient either horizontal or vertically.  The only problem is that the first one I got...the clip snapped the first day I wore it.  The replacement is holding up much better but it's gotten a bit floppy.  It would probably work fine for someone who was more sedentary...but I'm very active and put a lot of stress on stuff.  Still I have it and use it from time to time when I want to impress someone.
0	Do you have some money to waste? Buy this item. It is broken at 2nd day of use and does not stand phone. I rated 1 star because there is not less
2	The unit is not bad.  Other have complained of the belt part breaking off and although I have not had that I would complain as I don't think it holds the phone 'snug' enough in the holster part.  Have had times that the phone just slid right out of the holster from sitting down.
2	I cant say how yours is going to hold up but the one that I purchased did not hold up. The first day  the first time that I put this on my belt and went to sit in my car it broke. The belt clip shattered into millions of pieces. The only thing that is of use and that is why I at least gave it 2 stars was the case itself. It is of the best that I have seen yet. High quality looks and feel.and the ergonomics are very good too. It just feels good. The problem is that I wanted a holster with the case and if the clip breaking off is any indication to the rest of the quality on down the road than just get something else.
2	Hubby loves this but the belt clip is cheap and keeps breaking.  I have had to purchase another case from a different manufacturer just to keep his phone secured.
2	Thin materiel would not last long inexpensive looking. Did not look anything like what I seen on the ad returned item.
0	I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this item in white.....it was discolored within one week of purchase. This case was discolored very quick just from normal use.
2	Case did not protect the front of the phone and it made the back square instead of rounded fits in holster well but I did not like the feel on the phone I sent it back
0	This only last one week....The belt clip is made from a cheap plastic...! I like the kick stand to watch movies but that is it....Do not buy....D
2	I bought this for my dad. So far he likes it very much. Good price for what you get and so far (3 days) it hasn't broken or dropped the phone. The holster is secure and the clip has a groove so that the holster will not fly off your belt if you are running.UPDATE:At first the holster is great because it grips onto the phone. However after sliding it out multiple times it becomes loose and is easily removed. My dad was just walking and I guess the holster was slanted downwards a bit and his phone fell out. When it fell out the case came off. If you put your phone in with the screen facing out the holster has a better grip on it but if you have the screen facing in the phone is likely to come out.We are going to replace the holster with a leather pouch holster because this holster seems unreliable.
0	These do not work well and are very cheap. Sending back today! DO NOT waste your cash on this product at all. I have got so many better quality cases from different places on Amazon then what this one.
0	Snapped off the belt clip in less than a week just getting into a car.  Same problem many of these style cases have look for metal clips instead of plastic.  This is a real problem with the Note 2 as it is big enough that it is only a matter of time before it snags on something no matter how careful you are.  And if the clip is cheap and weak your phone is going to the floor and your holster is now worthless as the clip snaps off.
0	It was in the case and on my belt and the phone slid right out and busted on the pavement. Get yourself a real caste.
0	As soon as I wrote and recommeded this product it broke have not had it quite 3months need a relacement already understand what other customers concerns were now could not stand the test of time!
2	It was good while it lasted because it protected my phone allowing easy access. The belt clip never worked as a stand before it finally broke off due to my bending over with phone on my belt.  I retained the case part of the assembly an use it with my leather pouch now.
2	I didn't really care for this one. i don't use it that much because it doesn't give much protection for my phone which is pretty expensive. there are really no *pluses* to having this cover...it was inexpensive and shipped quickly tho...
2	Update: other than having to do the thread trick to keep the phone from slipping out it is a solid holster. I actually use it at the gym lifting weights so that I don't have to mess with the arm band. The clip is very solid after a month of use. I'd still recommend buying the other boxwave holster assuming that it keeps the phone from slipping out.Update: I had to wrap some thread around the claws of the holster to add enough tension to keep the phone in place.I ordered this one with the weave pattern because I thought it would help the phone vent heat easier and because a lot of people at work have the other case design with the softer rubbery feel and the stand.The 3 bad things about it are: 1) the material is very slick and the only thing keeping your phone in the holster is gravity.2) This case does not wrap around the phone the edges are square. This makes the phone feel a lot wider in your hand than other slim cases.3) is no protection for the bottom of the phone whatsoever. Most slim cases at least have a little wrap around for the bottom edges this case doesn't even try.The good thing is that it looks like they did put more effort into the belt clip.For the price I will say it is okay. I will probably add some tacky rubber to the holster rails to keep the phone more firmly in place. That being said I should have just gotten the other one.
2	This thing snapped.  The clip got caught on something and snapped right off.  There was no way to fix it broken plastic.
2	I gave this product a 3 because the clip easily broke off. the case is good which comes in two parts. A hard shell phone case is fits really well and you can use it just like that plus a sliding cover with a clip. The cover works like a screen protector and keeps scratches from the screen. The only bad side is since the phone is big and when you clip it on your belt the clip snaps off its place when you sit down. 2 occasions my phone fell on a taxi seat because the clip detached it self from the case. If I was not watchful i could have lost my phone. From that time on i keep my phone in my back pocket
0	well i got the BoxWave Holster and i went to use it for the First Time TODAY and it has a crack on the side of it i want a Replace ment can you please send me the replace ment for it ( The Belt clip side of the case has the crack on it )
2	Looks good but dont trust your phone in this. My phone fell out the first day in this case. should have a clip on top to keep the phone from sliding out. gave it two stars for looks but functionality........ it sucks.
0	It was cheap but the clip broke in less than a week. The very first day the clip/kickstand popped off. Just clipping it to my belt the natural movement of going about my day would pop the clip off the case and the phone would hit the ground. After a few days of the clip popping off and me putting it back on the plastic that held the clip on broke. I definitely wouldn't recommend this.
0	I received this on the 7th it broke on the 10th. I didn't hit it on anything or catch it on anything. Stay away from this it is cheaply made garbage.
0	This case would be OK if it fit. None of the holes line up camera slot stylis port etc. I will gladly accept another holster that fit correctly. Because this phone is so large I need a belt clip.
2	The holster does not hold my husbands phone. As soon as he puts his phone in the holster it slides right out. This makes him have to clip the case/holster inside his pocket instead of outside....which makes the holster pointless!
2	I got this case because it looked moderately protective and it was very cheap. It is pretty protective and it has protected my phone from a couple of drops. I actually let my friend use it twice and he tossed it about four feet in the air onto very hard carpet and onto the hard floor on a bus. Both times it came out unscathed. I definitely do not think it protects very well though. I do not think it could protect my phone for anything above 4 feet.I would definitely go for the IonicIonic GUARDIAN Armor Case for LG Google Nexus 4 (Black)or the BallisticBallistic SG1098-M005 AGF SG Series Case for LG E960/NEXUS 4 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Blackcase instead (I just ordered the Ballistic).The grips on the case are not very grippy at all. The 'grippy' part actually seems more slippery in my hands than the non-textured areas. So do not expect to get much more traction on your Nexus 4 with this case.Also It pulled up my screen protector a lot. I actually ripped it off and cut off the edges a couple of millimetres all around the protector and they cooperate better.Overall I could not recommend this product because of it's lack of true protection found in the Ballistic and Ionic cases (with three layers and two layer respectively). Spend a couple more dollars and get an upgrade.
2	nice fit and slimmer than most other cases. does provide a bit of protection to face-on falls and to corners. I like the frosted back look and the rigidity of the case. Much better than simple silicone ones.  It doesn't provide that much fall protection though and might not be worth the increased width since any impact will transfer through the corners to the phone.PROSCutouts fit well.Good shape to screen border so doesn't reduce touch areaComfortable and grippy to hold.CONSSeem from mfg. is sharp and annoying I sanded it down and it's much betterNot great fall protectionPower and volume buttons harder to press (this might be a pro too though)Collects dirt like a hoover
0	I bought three different TPU cases for the LG G2. This case simply does not fit. The top and bottom of the will not stay tight against the phone and bulges. Also this case does not form fit to the nice curved sides of the phone.
2	This case plain and simple is ok. It tends to scratch a lot but this one is for the road and stuff. One gripe about this one is that the buttons are to recessed. Its hard to push the power button. More than the volume rocker.
2	This is good but not what I expected. Its too hard to operate any button on the side of the phone like sound and the power switch.I would recommend not to go for this...
2	I love the fit and feel of this case for my s4.  However it is not shock as shock absorbing as I need.  I do not feel my phone is protected from even minor drops that inevitably happen with regular use of phones.  This spec quickly and was in original sealed packaging.
2	Felt cheaply made. bought a different one to replace it. 2 stars because the kickstand was functional. There are better cases for the money or a little bit more
2	It looks really bad on the black S4 but i gave it to my friend with a white S4. So if you have the white one buy it. If you don't then dont.
2	I bought this because of all the positive 5 star reviews. This case is nice and slim and is cheap. The big problem is it makes using the phone so much harder. A normal press of the buttons does nothing. You have to push really hard. I guess all the 5 star reviews have never used the phone with a case with cut outs.
2	This case is far from what I expected. The kickstand is awkwardly placed and it doesn't feel very comfortable when holding it. In addition the case is really thin. I wish I never hit the confirm purchase button.
2	If you want a solid cheap TPU case then this one will do.  It's a little more clear than the picture shows and so the blue isn't as brilliant on the phone as in the picture.  Still it works and at this price it's just as good as any of the more expensive TPU cases.
2	I didn't feel that this was a very sturdy product. It felt very flimsy but I tried it and was afraid to drop phone.
2	Someone else might find the appearance perfect. It fits the phone well unlike one or two I tried. Protruberances along the edges make it safe; you're unlikely to drop it using this cover. The cover definitely does not attract dust or show fingerprints.
2	I bought this case for my GS4 and its okay. I love these cases but this one was a little bit to lose from the top and bottom. So i bought an UAG case and i love it.
0	ordered my case 9 days ago..it should have arrived yesterday. there is no tracking but they give me a tracking number.....wheres my case.. you charged my card but no product..
2	This is an absolute steal when it comes to cases.  It's not as rubbery as some cases.  Has a great shape and is thin enough to provide great protection without adding a lot of bulk to an already large phone.  The only con is that the buttons aren't as responsive as I would like.  But for $3 this is a wonderful case.UPDATE (8/07/13): Unfortunately the inability to feel the volume and unlock buttons was a little much to overcome so I had to get rid of it.  Still not bad if you don't mind getting used to the feel.
2	I like the case but the stand only works in landscape mode.  This would be a better product if could use it in portrait mode too.
2	The case feels good in your hands and it won't slip out of your hands. I've docked a couple of stars is that in the image it looks like the buttons would be easy to press however that is not the case. The buttons are very flush with the case which makes it hard to actually use the buttons. I literally have to sometimes use two hands to push a button. If only the buttons extended outward this would be a good case. For now I will keep this as a backup.
2	The case is not as &#34;slim&#34; as advertised. It was hard to press the power button and the volume rocker. I had to use a knife to create some holes side of the case.
0	This review is for the BoxWave case with stand. The reason I have to say that is because BoxWave has NINE different cases on this one listing! I could understand if the &#8220;Size&#8221; option was for different models of phones but to have be different CASES is just misleading and probably saves BoxWave money on listing fees.As for the actual case&#8230; I bought this because it was one of the &#8220;Best Cases&#8221; for the s4 as per Cnet. I don&#8217;t know what the deal is however this case is pure garbage! The cutout for the bottom microphone is so off-center that the microphone is actually covered! As a result I sounded muffled to the person on the other end of the line. The cutout for the camera is the same way. For normal pictures it is OK as it case does not block the lens however it does partially cover the flash. As a result you get glare on the bottom of the photo from the flash.The Kickstand is useless. There is nothing to lock it in place so the phone falls over unless you balance it &#8220;just right.&#8221; Even then once you tap the screen (ie: skip a You Tube add) the phone falls over. Also the hinge on the back of the phone causes the phone not to lay flat.I paid $4 for this case and I got the type of quality one would expect for a $4 case. I WOULD NOT suggest this case if you are looking for a Kickstand case. Other cases on this listing &#8220;might&#8221; be a better quality case however I would not hold my breath. To be honest the cheap quality of the case I received and the deceptive nature of the listing I WILL NOT buy another BoxWave case.
0	Ordered this to cover and protect my new SGS4. It covers the phone but the holes for the mics dont line up centered over the holes and the buttons are nearly impossible to push (you really have to reef on them).
2	Did NOT fit correctly for my Samsung S4 (AT&T). I guess I got what I paid for. Be careful if you're particular about your case and want it to fit snug on your phone. This case is not a tight fit and is loose on the sides. I gave this case away or else it would've just collected dust in my drawer. I would not recommend this case to anyone!
2	I thought this item was clear but it had a grey hue. After a few days of use it began to look cheap and dirty. I would not buy this color again.
2	This case was okay... The rubbed edge is nifty but then the plastic was just thin and the kickstand is just poorly made... not to mention it's very hard to pull the kickstand out.
2	Shows up totally deformed (top of the case doesn't even touch the phone because it was cast crooked) and I have to pay to mail it back to them if I want a replacement? I don't want a replacement anymore I want a functional phone case. Definitely a &#34;get what you pay for&#34; kind of thing. The case is pretty inflexible so when I took the case off it also pulled off the back of the phone. Not the end of the world but definitely a crappy case. Would absolutely not recommend.
2	I bought this case and the Incipio SA-378 DualPro Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 .  This is cheaper... and does the job... but looks a bit cheap compared to this amazing S4 slick phone.  I like the lip to protect the screen.  The buttons work fine and the ports are good.  It is grippy but slides in and out of my pocket fine.  It seems to give ok protectionI think the Incipio case gives better protection looks much more sophisticated and isn't appreciably thicker.  It costs twice as much...but still is cheap.  I have a dock for my S4.  I had to modify the Incipio by cutting around the hole for the USB... I did not have to modify for the boxwave.
2	It is very great design and protected my phone really well from droppings. My one year old dropped it all the time and no problem. But the big problem is that it's stained. I don't know why I only put my phone in my purse not my jeans pockets but it got all blue-ish now
0	Don't buy this cheap ugly product! Worst mistake in buying a case for my phone. EEW! Never Again! NO! NO!
2	I purchase quite a few things from Amazon.com so I figured I would start writing reviews again especially for the products I end up having to send back to Amazon for Defects or just not working properly.Unfortunately this is one of those products its okay but with a few defects  and I can&#8217;t recommend this product it is not very good IMOPros:1. Great coverage of back and sides for protection cut outs line up perfect.2. Pretty thin doesn&#8217;t add much bulk.3. Glossy sides add a little better grip.Cons:1. Made my screen protector bubble up on sides2. Very slippery on back but glossy bumper on the sides helps make grip better could be better.3. Power button is near impossible to press with case installed (Deal Breaker)4. Pretty Plain
2	I bought this case because it was very cheap.  I should have known it was not worth it.  The case fit is too tight.  When I put it on my phone the lip that goes around the front of the phone was uneven.  No matter how many times I tried to take it off and put it back on again the lip was just uneven.  This caused my screen protector film to be displaced by this case.  It was much more of a pain than a help.  Get the real Samsung case and save yourself the headache.
2	I didn't like this case to hard to put on the phone. I struggled wit getting it on. Imagine getting it off. Did not like
2	Doesn't fit exactly around the bottom front area of the case.  material is very cheap feeling to me.  I suppose it will work in a pinch.  I ordered a different one however.
2	Pros: fit nicely good looking case easy to hold protect the screen from scratches if the phone's screen is facing down good qualityCons: Power volume buttons are very hard to press this is very important to get 5 stars. I may have to get different case but for $0.50 + $2.50 shipping what do you expect. There are many phone cases more expensive than this one and a lot worse.
2	This case does look good and it is comfortable to hold but for 16.95 it should be better. The cut outs fit well enough but the buttons are much harder to press when the case is on.I feel that for this price it should be significantly better than my 3 dollar no name TPU case i bought on Amazon.  It is not so why spend more money for nothing special. If you are going to spend this type of money you better get something for it.Go and check the Ballistic SG caseBallistic SG0867-M385 Soft Gel Case for Samsung Galaxy Note - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black Silicone/Black TPU/White PCfor the Galaxy Note to see what a proper case should be like; or just get that cheapo TPU case.Boxwave is just fleecing customers with this overpriced case.
2	The original battery lasted at least 2 years.  This one is not holding a full charge after a year and is clearly declining.Admittedly quality of batteries can vary from production cycle to production cycle but this one has been disappointing in terms of long term use.Price was reasonable.
0	I bought two but they sent three; took 4 weeks to get in mail as they'd warned when purchasing; wrapped up to look like OEM but I'm thinking it's a fake; people selling it certainly haven't responded to my complaints;  works no longer than my 4 and 6 year old OEM batteries scavenged from other folks dead Moto V3 RAZRs.  Wish I could give them NO STARS on this one.
0	I bought this battery several years ago for my RAZR V3 as the battery was about shot in it and I shoulda just saved my money. This was not worth the time effort or money. It wouldn't hold a charge for longer than an hour. Probably not a relevant review today but still not worth your money
0	Extremely disappointed in this product. It isn't the sellers fault but the Razor can't hold a charge longer than 35 minutes.I bought this battery in expectance that maybe it would be better. I was totally wrong. Thankfully I bought a new phone.Don't waste you're time buying a new batteryinstead save up and buy a new phone! Trust me I did.
0	Don't wast your money on this battery china made won't hold charge. I bougth 2 end up throwing it away.
0	This is the 3rd OEM battery I bought via Amazon Marketplace -- as with the others it was terrible. I ordered form the OEM shop a BR50. They sent a BR56 which is supposed to be even better with 3 hours talk time. It did not last 30 minutes after a complete overnight charge. Nowhere as long as the battery I am trying to replace which lasts over an hour instead of the original 2 1/2 hours.OEM sent a counterfeit fake battery --- not OEM. How can you tell? Because Motorola OEM batteries are made in Japan. These say clearly that they are made in china. I had the same problem and returned the same battery from Wireless Phone Accessories and Batteries4Less.AMAZON_- you should be screening these sellers and addressing these issues. There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.Theses companies make their money by selling junk counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it. For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time. My time is worth more than th $10 I get ripped off for. But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers. AMAZON's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth. Well AMAZON you can start here: Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offendersWireless Phone Accessories and nowThe OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.I paid $30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit. So it has nothing to do with the price paid. Just dishonest online sellers.
0	This is the second one they sent me both are complete trash. After 1 or 2 charge cycles it dies within 5 minutes when fully charged. DO NOT BUY
2	Using this software for the razor works great. You are able to transfer pictures videos contacts etc between PC and phone. Setting it up for the K1M is time consuming. You would need to download a development driver from Motorola and specify a different type of phone (I think V3M was what I used)
0	This product (version 4.0) works with my V3 and V3x.  It does NOT work with my new V3e.I am using the overpriced Version 4.0 disc purchased directly from Motorola.Software updates still do not recognized the V3e.  Not sure which models listed work and which don't but the fact that non-supported models seem to be listed is sufficient to be skeptical and go elsewhere.  Yeah and it's a penny PLUS a lot in shipping!So if the software works for you it is pretty nice.  If not you're out.  I gave a review of one star based on the fact that a model I KNOW doesn't work is in the supported list.
2	Easy to set up. Clean and nice appearance. Seems to have made a difference but not a huge difference. Not sure whether I installed it in an optimal location or not. (The repeater is in the attic as high as possible to try to reach the tower signal.) In retrospect given the actual results I got I'm not sure it was worth the money. Perhaps i could have optimized the installation such as by putting the repeater outdoors under the eaves to get better results.
2	Knowing the wide range of reviews of this product I ordered it anyway and would return it if it really didn't work out.Here's the summary: I spent much of two days trying every possible combination of signal antenna location: inside outside 10 feet high 20 feet high near a window in the attic.  I followed the instructions and kept the base unit as far away as possible with as much vertical separation as possible.  I oriented the base station antenna vertically and horizontally.Nothing worked.  I called Wi-Ex technical support and their recommendation was to buy the additional directional antenna and aim it at one specific tower.  I decided I didn't want to spend more and risk still not having the repeater work so I returned it instead.Now the detail.  I did quite a bit of background work.  I live in the middle of a nice flat part of Silicon Valley and there is no lack of towers around.  My house is a single-story wood frame; no big buildings around and no hills.  There are 3 AT&T; cell towers within 0.85 miles (I found them and measured distance).  The problem is that I happen to be located almost exactly in between and equidistant from these three towers and apparently their power is adjusted so that they don't overlap a great deal.  In other words I get three sets of signals none particularly strong and depending on specific conditions at any moment in time the strongest signal comes from any of these three towers at random.  So the phone is constantly hunting for a signal and rarely gets one very strong for very long.The YX510 repeater uses an omnidirectional signal antenna in other words it will see all three towers the same way my phone does -- varying in relative signal strength constantly.  It will simply repeat that mixed up signal.  Furthermore the YX510 will ratchet its boost down if it detects a strong signal which happens every once in a while.  So it is easy to see what is happening.  The repeater cannot help this situation and in fact makes it worse by occasionally ratcheting  boost down when it happens to get a short burst of a strong signal.  The end result was that my cell reception was no better with the repeater than without -- not better just different -- I was stuck more often in Edge than without but I did often have 2-3 bars as long as I was in line of sight of the base station and no more than 15 feet away.  Beyond that I lost signal.The solution would appear to be to use a directional antenna and aim it at one tower.  This would potentially solve these issues: the phone would not hunt between towers and the YX510 would not get a wildly varying signal strength (I think).  However I'm not ready to make that jump yet and will need to do some more research.I was also not very impressed with the construction or the instructions for the YX510.  I will want to look at other options (all of which BTW are substantially more expensive but generally the companies offering them have longer track records).The YX510 with omnidirectional signal antenna is probably a good product when there is a single dominant cell tower nearby.  In my case with multiple equal-strength towers (but at marginal strength) it did not help at all.  Since Wi-Ex tech support knew the problem immediately when I described my situation it appears they are aware of it -- which IMHO means they should make it clearer what the limitations are.  The marketing material and the installation guide are written to promote the idea that you just throw the stuff up and it should work.  RF just isn't like that.Thanks to Amazon returning it was easy.
2	I installed the antenna in the attic and the main box on a top shelf in the den. I only get a boost in signal (more than 3 bars) if I'm within 5ft of the box. I've tried moving the antenna to several different locations but haven't found anything that gives me a anything better than 2 bars in the rest of the house. Two bars is okay but I was hoping for a lot more.
0	Got two of these headsets because of high reviews.Used both headsets on PS3 had a lot of troubles getting it to work correctly and sync with the console.The audio seems a to have some static and the mic doesnt transfer you voice clearly.I bet there are better options. Maybe these arent the real Jabra headsets?
2	I am a first-time Bluetooth user.  I guess I must have ears a lot larger than the people for which this product was designed.  It does not fit me and therefore it is unusable.So my recommendation is that you try before you buy.
2	The shape of the hard plastic ear hook was designed to cause pain - note the 2 hard plastic jagged corners turned towards your ear while the rounded portion faces up and away from any skin that it could interfere with harming.My second complaint would be that you must hold it against your ear to be able to hear anything thus defeating the point of a hands free headset.The price is good and if you wear it in silent places where you stand a chance of hearing through it then it's almost usable but I've gotten Motorola 500 headsets for about the same price on Amazon and they work much better and are comfortable as opposed to painful.
2	I have had experience putting screen protectors on phones for several years.  I generally do pretty good with installation and have a minimum amount of air bubbles underneath the screen.With this protector I cleaned the phone very well before installing and ended up with numerous air bubbles/pockets.  I was able to use a squeegie like device and get most of them out but the ones that are still there are seemingly magnified due to the mirror surface.  It makes them much more apparent than a standard clear or anti-reflective screen protector.
2	This is a great screen protector if you want privacy while reading/texting in public but the drawback is you'll have a hard time seeing the screen as well on a bright sunny day.
2	A bit tough to put on. Thick is great for durability but makes it impossible to use with case and have no bubbles. looks great on until it gets used the. Smudges and scratches are all you notice plus not easy to see In bright conditions
2	the head set works well with my sony phone.  the only complaint i have is that the radio tuner feature on my phone doesn't work well with this product.  the original plug that comes with my phone works better because the plug actually acts as an antennae for the tuner.  this after-market one doesn't hand the antennae duties at all but the headphone part works fine.  i use it often enough.
2	These things may work decently but the reason for using them is completely awful. Oh and after about 2 weeks I could only hear static through the headset while speaking which would not happen when I used the same headset with my computer
0	Worst item I've ever purchased.  Brand new batteries wont' even fully charge my phone once.  Don't buy it.  The regular stores have stopped carrying it because it keeps getting returned because it doesn't work worth a darn.
2	While this product does charge our BB 8703e it does so in a flaky way.  You need to insert/remove the plug several times before the unit will start charging.Also it would seem that if you leave the batteries in the unit while not charging they get drained over time.All in all a good idea that was not executed correctly.
2	I bought this with the intention of using it with my vast supply of rechargeable AA's however to my surprise I discovered that it would only work with non-rechargeable batteries.  In fact it wouldn't even work with brand new Duracell Alkaline AA's.  Apparently it will only work with Energizers though I'm not sure how that's technically possible.  As often as I would expect to use this to recharge my Evo Shift when I'm out an about I would be buying and throwing away an awful lot of non rechargeable batteries which isn't very cost effective and isn't great for the environment.  It works pretty well with the supplied Energizers that come with it and it does have both Micro and Mini USB connectors but because of the limitations it only rates 3 stars from me.
2	Very nice little charger have not given it to my mother yet I was hoping that it had two small ends were the same as her phone is a bit different but it works with my other phones and I bought a set of energizer batteries to use
0	I wanted to use rechargeables (good performance and inexpensive) and keep this in my briefcase as a backup charger.That was the theory.  if you use anything other than lithium (very expensive) or alkaline (Poor performance) the positive contact will not touch. (I tried 6 different brands of rechargeables)I ended up taking it apart (disassembly is fairly easy) to put a solder blob on the positive terminal.  Now it makes contact with my NiMH batteries but the battery cover on this thing is really flimsy.  Add to that the blinking blue light - certainly gets your attention but it ends up being VERY annoying.  I tried to charge my Moto Q in my car (while using a BT headset) and I had to cover the charger with my coat.I ended up buying a noname made in China charger for less than half the price it has a screw on battery cover and a red LED rather than these super bright blinking blue ones.  And of course it accepted rechargables with no modifications.Basically there are better designed products out there for a lot less.
2	I gifted my phone to the Phillipines but needed a replacement battery that I shipped over.  I presume it worked.
2	Pros:* Nice sound* Good feel on the head* Rotating cups are nice for mixing (during practice not live see below)* Headset comes with a really nice carrying caseCons:* They are extremely difficult to pair with any device. Every time I use them I have to spend five to ten minutes just trying to get the headphones into pairing mode and to actually pair with the host device. Motorola used the horrible one button does it all interface for operating power and pairing even though there are two buttons on the headset.* The other button on the other side of the headset is useless because it's proprietary.  It's supposed to pause/play music but it doesn't work with any device I've ever paired the headphones with.* The little rubber flap that covers the USB and audio input plugs is always falling out and hanging lopsided.* The headphones say on the package and in adverts that you can connect a headphone cable to another device to listen instead of using Bluetooth but they don't tell you that the cable has to be Motorola's special headphone cable which you have to order from Motorola.  You can't just go to the store and buy a iPod headphone cable to use with the headphones like you can with most other devices.*The fabric on the inside of the headband is nice for keeping your head from sweating but it causes carpet burns on the back of your neck if you wear the headphones around your neck.*Not recommended for DJs (trust me I am one) because you can never be sure how long the battery is going to last as there's no battery meter. You really don't want your headphones to quit on you in the middle of a live show.* When the batteries get low there's a series of three beeps then an ear-bursting *POP* noise.  I wrote to Motorola to complain and ask if the issue could be fixed but they responded by sending me another set of the same headphones which had the same problem. The only workaround is to quickly jerk the headphones off of your head when you hear the three beeps to avoid hurting your ears with the loud pop noise.* There's a really bright LED light that fades on and off while the headphones are receiving audio that you can't disable on each side of the headphones.  It's kind of neat for about the first five minutes then it gets annoying.* The minimum volume is still sometimes too loud.* Default volume at power on is always too loud.
0	This is the best bluetooth headset I've owned in terms of comfort and sound quality. The microphone seemed to be fine.The ear pieces are unfortunately attached to the head band via thin plastic. In my case I experienced structural failure after 14 months of light usage.If you're going to spend more than $100 on headphones buy something that is more stout than this particular model.
2	I originally had the black wep which worked fine.  I upgraded to the red sync from cingular and wanted the red wep.  Everyone I spoke to told me I sounded like I was in a tunnel could never hear me which wasn't an overall good experience.  Cute in color small and useful but no one could hear me clearly when I was on it.
2	talking on it sounds like you are far away my phone customers say.  Very small can be awkward to keep in ear
2	Tried this speaker for a few weeks in my car but my wife and others complained they could not hear me over the background noise.  I tried eliminating or reducing the noise in my car (radio A/C fan ect) but nothing seemed to work even if the speaker was attached to the drivers' visor.
0	AVOID AVOID AVOID.  Will not hold a charge.  A useless piece of junk.  Get something better made. Not this POS.
2	I have owned this speaker for a few years now.Here's what I like about this device:* Relatively low cost* very compact. smaller than a credit card - I take it with me when I travel in case my rental car won't have BT* speaker quality is acceptable* very simple* turns off automatically if phone is out of range for a while* long battery life* uses standard USB for charging* easy to pair but you will have to be just a little 'techy'.Here's what I don't like:* inconsistent quality. Sometimes I get complaints from people saying they can't hear me. sometimes it works fine though. Bottom line is I cannot trust it for important calls.* the blue blinking light is very annoying at night and to my best knowledge cannot be disabled* need to remember to turn the device on when you get into the car. However connection is established pretty quickly.I still use this device mainly to use with my phone as a navigation device. I also make calls sometimes but I can't really trust this device for important calls so I would not recommend this device overall. It's OK but I would pay more to get better (and more consistent) sound quality.
2	I do a lot of freeway driving and I've tried 2 of these speaker phones with myTreo and the noise cancellation feature is poor. It works fine below 45 mph but the faster I go the more my callers complain about the road noise. Also you have to turn off Bluetooth on the phone when you turn off the speaker phone. The phone thinks it's still connected to the speaker phoneit will show that it's not connected to any Bluetooth devise but keeps the phone mic and speaker on mute until Bluetooth is turned off.
2	We bought two of these based on reviews. Wife didn't like hers at all. Mine on voice dialing recognized every word but the Yes command that actually would initiate the call. So no voice dialing. People on the other end reported they could not understand me. We returned them.
0	The first one I got stopped working in about a month later so Motorola replaced me with supposedly a newer one. New one continues to work but- person on the other side cannot hear correctly- lots of static like noises even when fully chargedFor the excellent customer service I should give 5 stars to Motorola and 1 (or 0) star to this particular product.Update: After this I tried Plantronics voyager 510 as a BT earpiece. This also had issues (while better than this Motorola T305) and so I gave up on bluetooth and went for wired in-ear Sennheiser headphones
2	It is a shame that Motorola build such a great phone but no driver for it.  The Motorola Phone Tool software 4.0 does not support this phone. Go through live Internet update to version 4.35 still no driver for it.  Tried Motorola web site there is no driver download for this phone. Contacted Motorol support they say they setup a special support line 800-972-1837 for this KRZR phone.  Called that number and opened case with them.  Three days later on the phone with their support engineers and managers for over 10 hours still could not get the driver.Motorola suggested to pay Verizon to enable the Internet services then sync the phonebook that way.  We are not ready to pay Verizon $50 per phone per month to just sync up the phone book.In this Internet age you would think any technology company would put all their support materials and drivers on the Internet for people to download.  Not with Motorola.  I guess they afraid LG would look their support material and making better phone than Motorola so they would rather hide the driver in their grandma's mattress -- even their own support engineer could not find that driver....
0	These are not good for long term. The phone gets really warm when charging. Instead go with the original chargers. If u can spend 200-300 USD for a phone u can afford an original charger. I stopped using these after couple times.
0	This charger was one of the cheapest but wasn't worth the savings.  In less than a month the product stopped working and upon examination it was clearly fried!  Even the outer plastic looked as though it was melting.  Definitely not worth it.
2	I have an Android based phone so I had to buyMotorola Mini-USB to Micro-USB Charger Adapterto go along with it. I know the secondary item is cheap so no biggie right? Well trust me...you will lose the adapter before you find yourself needing to use the portable charger. It's just human nature right? We lose things. So yes the charger works...but you'd better find a darn good spot to store the adapter or the portable charger will be useless.Instead might I suggest you purchaseMotorola Universal Dual-Charging Portable Power Pack - Black - Retail Packaging. It's not too much more expensive and will be more likely to be useful to you in the event of an emergency.
2	its not to much to say except that its a charger.its small black its a charger but i could not useit for my phone but it worked for my tablet
2	You know I get it. Gramps may not be too tech savvy. He just wants something that'll charge his phone is compact and made by a reputable company.  However I think Gramps understands the basics of fitting things into things. A square will not fit into a trapezoid for example. A square does fit into a slightly bigger square. This is generally accepted as common knowledge.So someone explain to me: why do people buy a charger - clearly labeled as having MINI USB plugs - and get mad when their MICRO USB doodads won't work with it?! ...Sorry for the rant. It's just...come on people. Do some research or read the product description at least. You can get mini USB to micro USB adapters on eBay for about $2-3. You can even get a mini USB to regular USB adapter so you can use the charger with any USB cord you have.Now to the charger. I saw a refurb for $4 and decided to try one. It's well designed and compact at less than three inches tall and about an inch thick. The LED indicator is easy to understand. The mini USB output slides away when not in use which also turns off the charger to save power. Unfortunately mine only adds about 1100mAh to my phone which isn't the 1700mAh claimed. Maybe it depends on your phone - I charged a Nexus 4 (with the adapters). And its output current is around 0.5A so it will charge slowly - or simply slow down your phone's discharging if you're playing games or something.Currently at $6 it works out to 283mAh/$. That's not a very good deal when you can get a 325mAh/$ PowerBot for only two dollars more. If this ever drops to $5 or below it's worth buying.
2	I bought this case for a brother DS-600 mobile scanner as it was advertised to fit that scanner.  However upon receipt I could not fit the scanner into the case as it is about 1/2 inch too short.  It is a good quality case well made and sturdy but they advertise that it will scanners that it clearly can not.
0	The holster looks nice seems to be well made and has a strong clip but it's so tight that when I put the phone in it presses all the buttons on the way in causing all sorts of unwanted things to happen. I have to put the phone in upside down to keep that from happening. When I do it that way it works just fine. Weird.
0	Still waiting on this product since I ordered it on January 1 2010 (3-5 days shipping)
2	There is a real dearth in the market for a decent stylus/pen for the iPad.  The pen works fine the rubber tip provides reasonable responsiveness but the cap can be easily lost and the pen is too thin for my taste. I use this product on a daily basis but don't expect to be blown away by its functionality.
2	I use this to draw diagrams and sketches using OmniGraffle for iPad and various whiteboard style collaboration software on the iPad. It is a much better experience drawing things with this pen then using my finders. Positioning is much more refined and accurate.The pen is relatively heavy and gives a quality feel.Only complaint is it seems pretty expensive for what it is. I wish it is $10 cheaper.
2	When I heard one of the previous reviews mentioning about this protector as a soft plastic I assumed it was the same as or similar to the polyurethane material like InvisibleShield products.  I've had a polyurethane screen protector before and it was great but I've been having trouble trying to find a similar product to InvisibleShield that are less expensive.  Basically it's supposed to be the stuff that is used to protect helicopter blades.Back to the WriteRight protectors I was glad that it came in a pack of 10 becuase I knew it might take me several tries to get it to fit perfectly.  Unfortunately with my Nokia N95-3 it took me about 5 times and I still couldn't get it right.  Good thing I only need half a sheet to fit my phone's screen.  (technically I have 20 sheets) I think it's harder because my screen is surrounded by the border of the phone with rounded edges.  That makes it harder to measure the size and having to estimate the curve of the corners.  I also applied it to my girlfriend's Sidekick LX which was much easier because of the screen.First of all you pretty much have to get it right on the screen on the first try otherwise the more attempts you make the more dust the adhesive side will pick up.  Secondly there will be many air bubbles you have to try to push out.  The ones in the middle are pretty easy to push out as you apply but the border ones are tricky.  When you try to push some of the bubbles out it looks like is just becomes a smudge that you can't push any further.When successfully applied to the screen it looks fairly clear.  There is however a rainbow tint from the light when you look at certain angles.  Not a major problem.  Yes the protector will attract dust but I believe that is true of many screen protectors; as my previous InvisibleShield protector also did.  The protector does scuff fairly easily as well.  When I used a paper towel and alcohol to clean off the oil on my screen it left a slight scuff where I was rubbing.  None of the scuffs smudges or bubbles effect the clarity of the screen when I'm using the phone.  Only when the backlight is off is when I can see the imperfections in the screen protector which is still a little annoying to me.All in all they give you 10 in a pack probably because they expect each of them not to last that long.  If you just want a protector that will prevent your original screen from getting damaged this will work.  But if you want absolute perfection with the backlight on and off I am certain there are better products out there.
2	If one puts the cover on correctly the first time they do a decent job. Use it for my GPS Camera wife's phone and flat touch panel on new microwave (I know...extreme).To cover most of our phones I'll only use the Zagg brand.
2	I bought these today at WalMart and they are terrible. After cutting with a paper trimmer they were perfect size. Although after VERY careful and slow application rolling on just a cm at a time air bubbles would form. I tried rolling the protector on as slow as possible while rubbing from center out with a microfiber cloth. After application and only rubbing the protector with microfiber it was scratched past the point of no return. I cannot imagine what this screen protector would look like after a few days of use.Although this product may protect the screen after a couple of days use you probably won't be able to see the screen with all the accumulated scratches. The users guide says for best results to replace monthly. After initial application I removed it and threw it away.Waste of money.
2	use on 2cameras and cell phone.  The cutting is fairly straight forward but the pre-cut edge that is supposed to help with seperating the backing from the protector is not cut well so i've wasted one sheet as it ripped easily while taking off the backing.  material not durable at all.  Got scratches just by using the squeegy in the package.  Lastly if you had to reposition it good luck getting the bubbles (hazyness) out.  Requires too much effort to get it right.  Would not recommand it.
2	This is a nice product but was not big enough for my smart phone with a case on it.  I ended up giving this away.
0	Poorly built phone holder.  The &#34;arm&#34; that moves was broken off when i opened the box due to the arm is only attached by the thinest piece of plastic.  Slight torque on the arm could easily break it off.
0	Terrible quality didn't fit my vents securely. Flopped around when driving..tried to take it off and it broke. Waste of money.
0	The sticky dash mount broke as I tried to remove it one of the arms shortly afterwards.  Also it comes with no instructions have to guess at orientation from the pictures.
2	Cellet Universal Car Vent or Dash Mount Phone Holder with Adjustable Grip  not good to buy this product easy broker
2	the first couple of days that i had it it work fine and after a week it just broke and im not able to use it anymore
0	I wasn't expecting much for the price but at least that it holds my iphone and it barely squeezes in with a good amount of force I have a very slim skin cover. Not worth returning but disappointing.
0	I have a jeep liberty so dont have that much dash board. (Sticky past kept coming off) I tried it on car my vent and it does not stay were it comes in handy. Would not recommend this product.
2	When I pressed the release button it expanded but would not fit the phone and lock anymore. I opened it and replace the faulty spring. It works now.
2	They said it was universal mount but it did not fit my Samsung Galaxy 3! I returned it and don't believe I ever received my credit.
2	I bought this for my Samsung S2 expecting somewhat of a snug fit (I don't have a case). It fit for the first few weeks and then the left vent clip decided to snap along with the adjustable arm. on top of all these issues the padding was next to useless. Getting a suction cup holder next.
2	I've been impressed by the windshield lock-grip of Garmin Nuvi units and even by the effectiveness of a 9-dollar silly-looking gooseneck that not only held my iPod in place but charged it and served as reliable FM transmitter to boot. This latter item item didn't score well with other Amazon customers--proof that you can't always trust the ratings.In the case of this Universal Car Vent or Dash Mount Holder you can trust the consumer ratings--in fact they may even be a bit high. The device is branded as a Cellet universal mount in the title but in the description it's referred to as a Luxmo universal mount.  No matter. A poorly designed piece of plastic is--by any name--a potentially useless piece of plastic.The idea here is that you can if you choose unscrew the base and toss it so that it's not in the way of the bracket which you then are supposed to insert in any convenient vent.  Unfortunately my air vents were either too narrow or too wide to accept the bracket or Vent Mount (non)solution.  So it was on to Plan B the Dash Mount solution (at least it's a versatile little fellow).  But the base for this kitschy piece of curious clutter is no more than a single square inch.  Moreover I had kept the unit for over a year before deciding to give it a try.  So not only was the sticky substance spread over too small a foundation: it was no longer sufficiently sticky to hold in place my iPod Touch even if the surface area were a whole foot!Here's where I was spared the worst nemesis of every neophyte--i.e. making a bad thing worse by trying to make it better.  In other words I was about to get out the Crazy Glue and muck up my otherwise clean dashboard when it struck me that maybe I ought to see if this adjustable guy actually would clasp my iPod as advertised.  Upon pressing the button for releasing the spring and extending the gizmo's right arm nothing happened.  His right arm was jammed (and the left is clearly non-adjustable).  Since he obviously needed a helping hand I gave him one.  Unfortunately my gentle tugging  pressure was enough to snap off that piece of plastic on the right side of this holder with the (non) Adjustable Grip.Mercifully the experience came to an end before I'd given this low-(but over)priced imposter a chance to show its stuff.  But even more fortunately I can now put this review to rest.  May the next buyer have a happier story to tell.  As for me I'm back to my original clunky and unsightly but effective mount with the gooseneck:GSI Super Quality Wireless Hands-Free 5-in-1 Dock-Mount-Charger-FM Transmitter-Car Kit with Goose-neck Mount for Ipod IPhone 4-3G-3GS MP3 MP4 CD DVD Players - Includes Remote Control Audio Cable LCD Display - Cigarette Lighter Plug-In.
0	It was kinda too small for my phone the advertisement said that it fit the GS3 even after I took the case off it still didn't fit and one of the holders completely broke off! If you have a GS3 don't buy this it's trash
2	I thought this item was a good idea as it gives you the opportunity to mount your phone closer to the seat instead of up on the windshield.  I discovered 2 things:1) The unit itself is very cheap.  The adjustable arm used to clamp your phone has a major weak spot.  Mine broke right out of the package.  I made some repairs to strengthen it but first use showed that this device does not work well with any smart phones.  I have an iPhone and it's too wide and tall for this device.  You can't clamp your phone very well because of the cheap design and the bottom ledge is too small.  After 5 minutes of driving I had to remove my phone before it fell out.This is a good idea that was implemented poorly.
2	This mount is actually great for the first two days. I used it on the vent and on day two or three after I received it it would start moving to the sides when I turned. I would have to readjust every time. I used it on a GalaxySII it was very tight fitting. So DO NOT BUY.
2	I'm not very impressed with this.  It's super cheap and fits very loosely on my car air vent.  It wiggles around and looks bad as well.  I would not recommend.
2	spend the extra money and get the ones that have a long neck and are adjustable.  These are ok but love my one that cost $25
2	I had trouble sticking both the silver plate and the black plate to my dashboard. They're just not strong enough and the magnet takes it right off the dash. I had to do some customization but eventually got the silver thin metal piece. I had to shape the thin silver plate into a taco and just clamped it onto something in my car so it would stay.
2	I had issues with the set sticking to my car.  Even after following the directions step by step.  My Iphone ended up getting a big scratch on the screen due to the magnetic that sticks on the dashboard falling off.I did contact the seller and got a new one that works fine after a few emails.
0	Terrible Unit. magnet not strong enough for Iphone 4s. Ended up buying a differnt model for 25 bucks that connects to your cd player slot and that one is amazing.
2	I am one of those people who has a dashboard that this product doesn't stick to.I have a dollar store mini glue gun and a dollar store bag of glue sticks.I heated the glue gun ran out of the house with it to the truck applied the glue to the holder and squished it on to the desired place on my dashboard. All is well but 3 stars due to having to secure other items to make this work.
2	It is too tiny for holding a phone. The metal plate is also too tiny and thick to put between phone and case. Don't even bother to think about this product.
0	Mobile service providers claim that this type of antenna does not work and I have to agree with them.  Installing it actually reduced my reception from 2 bars to NO bars!  If you search the internet you will find that passive antennas like this are no different than that battery compartment sticker that claimed to improve cell phone reception block radio waves from frying your brain etc.  It doesn't work and it's a waste of money.I recommend buying a wired antenna that directly connects to your phone.  If you phone doesn't have such a connection then you may want to look into a different phone because nothing without a direct connection is going to work and you may want to look into a phone that gets better reception (there are some -- just read the 3rd party reviews).I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless you just have money to burn.  If so please just send it to my PayPal account instead.
0	Had zero effect. My windows must already allow enough signal through for this to not make a difference. Bought it for the back of my place because I get full bars right outside on the patio and almost none inside (I live in a concrete apartment). If I put the phone in the same place I had this I get good reception but this didn't extend my signal any or act as a repeater. Didn't seem to help in the car either but I don't really need it there.
0	Does nothing. Did not and any noticeable change. I have used it for some time.  The only time it does anything is if it's on your phone.
0	There are a few spots around town where my calls get dropped when I use my cellular phone while driving in the car.  These areas are very small only about 300 feet long.  And if I hold the phone outside the car when I drive through these areas the calls don't drop.I bought this device with the hope that it would allow me to keep calls going without rolling down the windows.  Unfortunately I found absolutely NO difference between calls being dropped with and without this device.When I took the device off it broke open and I took both sides apart.  I didn't find any evidence of components that will inductively couple the antenna and the interior components.However when it was installed it did **look** impressive.  So if you want a fake cellular antenna to make your car look cool this will fit the bill perfectly.  If you want a performance improvement consider one of the Wilson cellular repeaters instead.
0	LOOKS GREAT FITS INTO THE DOCK JUST FINE AFTER YOU PULL OUT THE SLEVE. BUT WITH IT ON THE PHONE YOU LOOSE ONE-TWO POWER BARS OR ON-TWO WIFI RINGS. TAKE IT OFF AND THEY'RE BACK.
2	Like I said in title theres not much to it u drop it its going to break and its just for looks I think. Price is a little high and no protection
2	This case is works and is cheap so I am still giving it a few stars but I feel it is a little bit of tricky advertising and the item is not as one would expect.When you scrutinize the description it does state Brushed Aluminum Back Cover which I took to mean the cover is aluminum.  What it truly means is that the case is clear plastic and a little brushed aluminum plate has been glued only to the back.  In the picture it appears the entire case is aluminum which is what I really wanted but not so. The case is clear plastic all around the sides and only metal on back. I'm not sure what the purpose of making only the back aluminum except to keep it low cost but as anyone purchasing this is probably expecting a metal case it is a let down over all.P.S. The case is slippery.
0	I looked over the reviews I am not sure if I received something else or what...this case just looked cheap. It broke on the side in no time...(haven't even had it 24 hrs).I am not sure what the photo is but the one I recv'd did not look anything like this.
2	I have the grey HTC One wanted to see its color and didn't want a case as large as say an Otterbox.  I really wanted to enjoy the phone size and color in its current original state.  As usual read quite a few reviews.  Ended up here so paying it forward!  Enjoy...ProsGood snug fit around phone without a bunch of loose spotsAll buttons and phone 'openings' line-up appropriately with phoneNice change in texture on rear to prevent slippageRaised lip although minimal prevents screen scratches etc.Not flimsy or bulky (can really enjoy phone as built)Con'sMain gripe: Because the phone power button is pretty much level with the phone (not raised) the opening in the plastic case does not make it easy to depress the button.  Would have been better to leave this hole filled with plastic as they did with the up/down volume buttons.  Would be easier to differentiate between power button area on top and charge hole on bottom when dark etc.Volume buttons need to be a bit more pronounced - almost too flush.Not worried about openings being exposed...I completely understood that this was NOT an Otterbox type case.  However with a few tweaks this could be a 5 star case for its particular application.
2	The white turned blue in the pocket of my jeans which I guess I should have expected but it took less than a week.The volume buttons were covered and made it difficult to push them.But the case protected the phone and the lip at the front helped protect the screen.
2	Ok so i wish i felt i could give this 4-5 stars but 2 things really bug me 1st and most annoying is the power button becomes recessed wit this case  the volume buttons have an extended piece that makes them ez to access but the power button doesnt and 2nd the top and bottom seem to bow out a little and not quite fit almost like maybe a bad batch cause it is close really close but it bows out. so i love the look and feel it shows off this pone. keeps the sleek curves. oh i wish that power button where easier to hit and it would be a case i really like.
2	I was a bit nervous when I ordered this case since there were no reviews.  Cimo had a similar hybrid with frost clear back.  Supcase had a similar product too but the back was clear.So I took a chance.  This is a very attractive case on the One.  The black trim on Silver back provides a nice contrast.  There are cutouts for everything except the volume buttons.  I tested the volume buttons first since some cases make it difficult to press the buttons.  No so with this case.  Very easy to press.The cutout for the rear facing mic leaves plenty of room between the mic and cutout (the mic is perfectly centered within the cutout).  The bottom mic is a bit off-center within the bottom cutout but it's far enough from the material.  Cutouts for LED and rear facing camera match the pics that accompany the product description.  Cutouts for power/IR and headphone jack are centered.Case is very snug (I like that).  Bumper provides a nice grip since it is textured.  There is a good sized lip on the case that will protect the screen when placed faced down on a flat surface.Once concern with other brands is that the hard material sometimes separates from the TPU material. I'll update the review in a few months after I use this case for awhile.This case replaces a Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit Clear case... mainly because the Cruzerlite's idea of clear is actually frosted white.  And it cost $12.90.Overall this BoxWave is great case for $5.70 that was Prime eligible.*******************UPDATE:  2013-09-28*******************I bought 2 of these cases since we have 2 HTC Ones in the family.  My case is still great.  My daughters case on the other hand has not fared as well. The rubber bumper has separated almost completely from the hard case after 2 months of use.  I downgraded my rating.  5 stars for my case 1 star for my daughter's case and the average is 3 stars.
2	So I was waiting to plug this into my xbox controller so I can finally use a regular headset. However even after I plugged it in my headset still didn't work and I know it's not the headsets fault because I have tried it elsewhere. So when purchasing this product beware that it might not work with your Xbox controller it might work with other objects but I haven't tried.
0	I guess this is what I get form trying to cheap out.  I used this piece to connect regular headphones to my xbox 360 I had to hold the device in place or turn it just right in order for it to work.  But as soon as I moved it stopped working again.
2	the only reason I'm not rating this item 1 star is I took a gamble to see if it would work with myPanasonic KX-TG6511B- it doesn't :/i saw other products that were pricier that were explicit they work and this one wasn'tso if you have a Panasonic cordless phone you've been warned!
0	Be careful to know what you need. The picture shows a 4-conductor 2.5mm to 3.5mm which is what I needed.  However the specs say 3.5 to 2.5 which is what they sent.  Also note that 3-conductor is for stereo headsets. 4-conductor is what you will need if using as a phone headset/microphone.
2	I bought these as in more than 1 thinking they would work on my home cordless phones and they did not as in you can hear the person on the other end but they cant hear you talk :(.
2	Bought this because I recently got an LG Octane cell that I love except for the 2.5mm headset plug.  I use a wired headset with a boom mic at work due to background noise causing too much interference with the mic on my Bluetooth headset.  Headset has 3.5mm plug.  Bought this to use the headset with the LG.  While I can hear the caller with both ears the MIC does not work!  I had another adaptor I had used with an earlier LG and it had the same problem but hoped this would work based on the (admittedly vague) description and a review specifically stating it worked with the Octane.  Apparently that reviewer only wanted it for music even though that's not what he stated.  Anyway the same headset worked fine in a Motorola Droid RAZR with a built in 3.5mm jack.  I knew this was a crapshoot.  I lost.  Hope to keep others from repeating my mistake.Also the adaptor I got is white- the pictures of it vary depending on how you search for it and change from the item description to the picture in your shopping cart.  This is a pretty sketchy listing for Amazon.  Wasn't sure what I was getting and didn't get what I expected.  Oh well.  Only $3 wasted.
0	Thought my headset for my computer which has a 3.5mm plug would be able to be used by plugging into this converter cable which then would fit my ATT 2 Line office phone. It does not. The price is so low it would cost me more to send it back than it cost to buy. Bad purchase.
2	So far the bluetooth is not quite as good as my stand-by Plantronics Voyager 520 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging] of which I've bought two. I've been told that the bluetooth sounds as good on the other end as my Voyager 520 but from my end it's not quite as good. The best part of this bluetooth is the vehicle power adapter. All of my other bluetooth earpieces have come with a desktop/wall charger and the primary reason I ordered this is so I can charge it in my car. When the charger is fully extended and the bluetooth attached it looks like a huge spy pen. For that reason alone everyone who has seen has wanted to order one.This is so cheap you can order it and keep it as a spare in your car since it's easy to charge and doesn't take up much more room that a big spy pen.
2	I have owned 2 Plantronics headsets -- The 665 and its predecessor the 655. Both have suffered the same fate. The little rubber ear tips are flimsy and keep breaking. When I pick up the headset the ear tip falls out. I purchased the ear tip replacement pack which costs about $10 and you get 3 ear tips -- 1 small 1 medium and 1 large. Given that I only have a need for 1 size I basically had to pay $10 for one ear tip... which broke after 30 days. The headset sounds pretty good fits in my ear OK and people say they can hear me pretty well. Despite all of these positives I will be replacing it with another brand.
2	My first impression is that whoever designed this product must have liked Kinder eggs when they were younger: everything involves assembly and the car charger looks like something out of a Bond movie. Although I didn't have any issues with the call quality the biggest problem was the plastic hoop that connect the headset to your ear - it's flimsy breaks off easily in your pocket and isn't particularly comfortable.It's definitely not bad for the price but I don't think it stands up well to the Motorola range. If you spend a little more you can get a little more comfort and considerably fewer attachments.
2	I guess it depends on your phone even though this cable says it works with the shine there is no shine driver on the cd. without the proper driver you cannot proceed. I don't think it's the cable at all which is working very well at charging the phone. I did hunt around and downloads the drivers the phone then shows up as removable f:...sometimes....but not in Windows Media Player and I could not get any music to transfer I kept getting I/O device error.By the same token I got a Z9 and was able to easily connect and transfer using WMP.I bought a reader writer and I was able to finally get music onto the shine. So just beware that the data cable is NOT working with all phone. It's all over the internet too.
2	THIS WAS CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. THEY WORKED FOR A WHILE AND SLOWLY OVER THE YEAR ALL OF THEM FAILED. I JUST THREW THEM AWAY.  THE HUBBY TOLD ME NOT TO BUY THEM LOL
2	I love my usb cable it fits perfect and I have no problem what so ever I recommend this product.
2	I select two star because this package was no good at all. My dislike is that I would had paid more to forward it back. Will I recommand this package no. Sometime more mean lease bad purchase on this item.
2	looks great.. it is large but i can live with that... the screen is really good.the camera has poor quality and has a shutter laag.. and its big!!!! like 2 sec!!!!the software is EXTREMELY slow!! if u want to open up the messages or addresse book u have to wait a few sec until everything is loads up and of course everything else is slow too!.. pathetic!voice dialing is useless!!! i couldnt use it!!!! the voice whos talking is too fast and not loud enough.. and there is NO SETTINGS FOR THAT!!! unbelievable!!!! voice calling couldnt understand me 9 times out of 10!!! and i didnt try to call a russian or german guy.. the phone didnt understand chris and peter.... lol!all my friend used my phones voice calling.. in most cases it wont work!and the voice is breaking up... ( half duplex effect.... )lol and the phone wasnt on the speakers.. never..btw the speakers are loud!! i liked it. and it plays movies mp3s... etc..good entertainment phone better than samsung upstage.. not good for talking...... lol.. but its true.
2	I ordered this phone a month back and just received it a few days ago.I bought it mainly for the 3G connection and the fact that it's an Nseries phone.I came from a Nokia 6230 which is a fairly small candy bar style phone so going to a bigger flip phone like the N75 is a big step.I did use a 6102i or whichever free phone cingy had at the time and my gripes are basically compared to those two phones.HATE:- Sim card access. I don't know if there's another way to do this but once you insert that SIM card you have to have a child take it out. Almost impossible for me to grab and pull out.- Speakerphone is really low and almost inaudible even with the volume cranked up- Vibrate on the phone is really... mild. If it's in your pocket you probably won't feel it. Especially if you're on the train for example.- Long boot up compared to the two non Symbian phones I had.- very annoying pop port .. i didn't think it would be an issue but if you have to hold the phone with two hands to insert your headset... annoying.- no emoticons on txt messages??!!- to reply to a txt you have to hit options->reply->via txt msg. Why can't i just hit reply and go straight to the txt box?- zoom on phone takes f o r e v e r.- where is the STOPWATCH and COUNTDOWN TIMER?!- fingerprints/face prints get xfrd to phone easily- my battery life : internet use only on/off = 4-6 hours with 2 10min calls and 6hours standby; MobiRadio on speaker continuous = 1.5hours; mixed internet mobiradio regular radio phone calls text messaging tinkering with phone= 6 hours or so. All hours est from full charge to when the batt just dies. Includes intermittent standbys and where I just look through the phone.The charger is now tethered to my hip.Like:- really soft and big keys- ability to move around the files/ folders- Nice big screen- Video (choppy and pixelated but it will do)will con't as the months pass.....**UPDATE:-battery life has improved significantly. I still use it 13hrs a day but I now charge just once a day. And i use it more.-I also bought this primarily as an MP3 player and I'm having the same problem that I had with the 6230. The shuffle is not really a shuffle. I have about 200 songs in there and it insists on playing the same songs over and over every 10th-15th song... it seems to loop to songs I've heard already every single time.-I use the HS-31 headset that I had before and the volume is just really low. I have to roll the windows up in my car in order to carry a conversation. I thought it was just the speakerphone that had a low volume. The bluetooth earpiece was loud though.-And finally 3G. I found no discernable difference between EDGE and the 3G networks while downloading video or viewing webpages. Maybe it loaded up a page a few seconds faster but that was about it. Mobiradio still buffered every now and then in 3G networks so that was surprising as well.I'm still going to keep the phone though.
0	The battery I received is not new...I thought I was buying a new battery but instead received a battery that is in no better condition than the one I am replacing.  Now to be fair I went back and looked and it doesn't actually say New in the description but it doesn't say Used either.  The picture is of a new battery and describing it as Original leads people to believe they are receiving a new original OEM replacement part.  This is not the case.  I called the customer service number and its an answering machine asking for your name order number and detailed description of why you are calling.  I somehow get the feeling they get a lot of calls complaining about this so they use this as a screening method.  This seller is shady and should not be allowed to sell on Amazon.  My recommendation...DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!
2	OEM battery but how old is it? This battery holds a charge but for a shorter time than I expected.
2	you get what you pay for .. the battery is years old .. but works.The shipment time was awful from the seller. They lost my shipment and had to resendthe order .. it arrived me after more than 20 days of waiting..
2	Bought these in Aug 07 and they worked great out of the box.  They were especially good in the gym or anywhere inside but had a very limited range outdoors. When jogging you have to keep your device strapped to your arm-which is not a big deal and the headset works good.  Reason the review is in the past tense is that from one use to the next the volume up control stopped working. The volume down button worked so I tried lowering the volume to the bottom and then increase..oh well..it reached the bottom and won't increase so essentially you can't hear any sound out of it any longer.  I'll now have to deal with the warranty dept of Motorola I suppose. But I wouldn't buy these again as I have read of this defect in other reviews
2	Not much to say here.  Got it out of the box.  Paired easily.  Worked a few times and then would no longer change the volume on the headset.  I suspect a short.  Regardless it's not saying much for a product when it stops working after less than two weeks and barely an hours worth of usage.  I wonder if Motorola just doesn't make a good product anymore.  It sure would be great to have a working headset.
2	I gave up trying to use this Headphone with my HTC TytnII PDA phone in my pants' pocket. It has so much interference that the audio is on-and-off every 2 seconds. Useless.However it works with my computer at very close range.All other bluetooth devices I tried with my phone have worked perfectly. This one doesn't. The range probably gets reduced due to the audio being stereo...???? (just gessing).
2	They work sound quality is ok battery life not so much . . . only holds a charge for two hours or so.
0	I purchased the Motorola S9 about 2 months ago and it worked fine for about 1 month.  Then the buttons stopped working consistently and finally stopped working all together.  I got agreement from Motorola to replace the headset under warranty a month ago and shipped it back and still not headset.  When I called I got the typical call center garbage putting me on hold disconnecting the call etc.  Finally I got someone on the line and they claimed that the headset is out of stock and that is why I did not receive it yet.  They never notified me of this and when I asked when it would be in stock I was told they did not know but I could call back in a week.  I told them that was not going to be OK and then they claimed to have resubmitted my order and I would receive it in a week.  We shall see...Do not buy this headset many people have had trouble with the buttons  and customer service has been terrible getting this remedied.
2	I had to give this product 3 stars because I couldn't really try them for music streaming (listen to music)If your phone does not have A2DP this headset will not work for music streaming it will only work for calls. I have the Cingular 2125 I bought this headset and a couple of days later it was on its way back to Amazon. So before you buy this item make sure your phone has A2DP. Amazon should really highlight this fact.
2	The main reason for getting these headphones is that you don't want to look like an idiot with big elephant-size headphones hanging on your head - like most other bluetooth headsets look like.BUT the size is the cause of most of the problems.  Because of the size they're apparently not able to get a big enough battery in to make battery life acceptable.  It's okay but these are the first headphones that have actually gone dead on me because I didn't charge them enough.Also size apparently effects the transmitter/receiver in them.  People I talk to on the phone constantly complain about my voice dropping out.  And if the headphones aren't reasonably close to the phone or the phone's not on the right side of my body I start hearing static.Also related to phone calls and this is the most annoying thing of all - when on the phone you can only hear out of one ear!  Super annoying!  You might say so what - you can only hear out of one ear on a home phone.  But with a cell phone you're outside where there is more noise and often times the ability to hear out of both ears is the difference between being able to continue the conversation or having to end it.Plus it's really annoying to have the ear buds in both ears but only hear sound coming out of one ear.  What were they thinking!!??And I agree with the others who have slightly larger than average heads.  They're really uncomfortable after about 10-15 minutes.  They really squeeze on your head.
2	Bought these @ Target when they first went on clearance from $100 to their current Amazon price.I'm a runner so these were mainly used for running with an iPod Classic. it was really nice not having to worry about a cord bouncing up/down while running. the reception was/is wonderful.Since i purchased these about a year ago i've moved on from an iPod to an HTC Evo & also use this headphone for work.here are my thoughts--in simple and quick format.Pros:1)bluetooth pairs easily with Evo==after initial pairing the phone will remember the device and activate its connection on each startup of bluetooth (with headphones being turned on)2)signal distance==i've gone from my desk where my phone rests to the Bailer about 30 yards away and still have a strong signal. to anyone saying you must keep it in line of sight and in your front pocket--you're not using it right. or you got a defective unit. mine works in a warehouse through boxes and pallets and steel beams.Cons:1)uncomfortable==OH MY GOSH my ears kill after 10 minutes of using them. Good Lord i can't stress this enough. i'm not a small man and i'm not stretching these out--but i've had to remove one side from my ears just so its not like my head is in a vice grip.2)Design of buttons==buttons are on the vertical band which raises upward from the earbuds towards the arch that goes over the ears. that means everytime you go to switch a song change the volume or press Play--you're pressing a small nub of plastic forward which digs into the arch of your inner ear and feels like someone's twisting it with needle nose pliers. this has to be the most annoying aspect of these headphones.to explain: any time you press your index fingers against your ear to block out sounds--you're pressing against a small flap of skin/cartiledge. this small flap of skin/cartiledge is bent forward/outward whenever you change volume/track & literally causes a headache every time.solutions: possibly smaller ear buds? i'm looking into it. but for the time being--i have to make due with what i've got.for the price--they're awesome. as a runner--they don't short-out when you sweat on them. they're really adequate when you DON'T press the buttons.i give this product 2 of 5 stars+1 star for easy ability to pair+1 star for signal strength-2 star for uncomfortability (really they're that uncomfortable)-1 star for design in placement of buttons
0	O.K. O.K. I know there are numerous reviews here that warn that these headphones fail if you sweat on them but I decided to try them anyways.  If you want to use these for workouts do not ignore the warnings - go buy something else.I received them yesterday paired them to my blackberry and headed out to the gym.  They worked great for about 30 minutes then the left speaker and all controls on the left side (volume up down and phone buttons) ceased to work.  I was definitely sweating but come on they don't even last 30 minutes???  Sent them back to Amazon this morning.  Maybe I'll try the Jaybirds next-
2	I think the looks and comfort of this headset are phenomenal. This is a comfortable headset that doesn't scream for attention and allows me to have a functional hands-free phone experience. I will get right down to the pros and cons:PROS:* Comfortable to wear and stay in place.* Very good call reception quality.* Decent stereo music playback quality.* Fairly good battery life.* Universal USB charging port.* Easy pairing.* Good looks that don't look ridiculous or rude.CONS:* Sometimes very poor call quality when talking. I've had people complain that they had a hard time understanding me while I'm driving (windows shut stereo off). I think it amplifies ambient sound that will drown out voice.* Music sound quality requires a bass boost. I've found that this headset is geared more for voices in the middle and higher ranges. Music can sound tinny.* There is a need for an adjustable headband. The headset stays on but can sometimes feel like it's flopping in the back. I have a medium (7 1/4) hat size.I don't think this product is quite there especially if you are looking to use it for phone calls. I use mine primarily with a BlackBerry Pearl and a Motorola Q and the better sound quality comes from the BlackBerry so the type of device you are using with it does matter.Still I received this as a gift for Christmas 2007 and was excited at the time. I would suggest looking in to the newer version the Motorola S9-HD which has improved sound quality:[...]
2	Inside these work great- I can walk far from my phone and the sound is awesome- Outside I get a lot of wind interference.. I exchanged them and still had the problem outside. Also they are uncomfortable after wearing for a long time for me. There are better bluetooth headphones out there but these are just ok ..
2	Looks great. Charges easily. Love that it's moisture resistant which is perfect for running and doing a lot of walking in various weather as I do. Also my sweat won't ruin it.BIG CON: Very very twitchy in keeping connected to the phone. Basically if it's not in your back pocket it's going to cut out a lot if you move your head too much etc. I prefer keeping my phone in my front shirt pocket but that doesn't work so well with this headset. Also you can't very well sit down with your phone in your back pocket either (and then it doesn't connect well either because you are sitting on the phone). So really only works well if you are standing up and it's in your back pocket. All other uses are only so-so.Wish I hadn't bought it.
0	Pros: good pairing and consistent stream. Decent sound although not loud enough.Cons: very uncomfortable fit(my ears hurt just after an hour of having them on) lots of background noise sound doesn't get loud enough in pulic busy places extremely annoying when you wear any jacket since you keep feeling it catch.Bottom line: Don't buy it! The participles for a good device is there but they need to improve on the design and make a lot more comfortable before people can start enjoy using it.
2	I purchased these stereo bluetooth headphones for use with my Blackberry Curve 8900.These headphones work well indoors with no problems with connectivity however the story is quite different when I am outside with the Blackberry in my pocket...the reception cuts in and out to the point where its unusable.  Holding the blackberry in my hand seems to improve the reception somewhat but that defeats the purpose.This is quite disappointing since I wanted to use these when I am out running so I am back to my wired headphones.  I am not sure if this is due to the Blackberry or the headphones itself.  There were some posts over in the Blackberry Forums that complain of this same problem.
2	I have had my S9 for about 2 months now.  I love it for the gym.  Problem is the up volume button stopped functioning.  After doing some online research this appears to be a relatively wide spread problem and it appears that Motorola has not fixed the problem in the newer S9-HD unit.  Same problems being reported.  Good headset when the buttons are working properly but I would not buy another one.
2	I love Otterbox. No I LOVE Otterbox. When I saw this come in for review I nearly did a dance for joy because as we all know they aren't cheap. These things are like armor for your phone. I have dropped my phone sat on it threw it and all kinds of stuff while it had an Otterbox on it and never had a scratched added to it.The problem with this &#34;Defender&#34; series is the screen protector portion. See getting this thing apart to put it on requires supernatural skills - the same amazing skills are required to get it off once it's on your phone as well. So yeah before I could even get it apart to put it on the phone my finger went through the screen protector so that part was broken.It takes a little doing to get it on your phone. Maybe it's because I'm not actually a superhero but after a little grunting and a lot of cursing it was on. I snapped the screen on it and the rest of it and.... then decided to see how well I could get it off.Hahahahahaha... a bloody finger and more curse words later it was off.It's on there now and I do have a regular peel and stick screen protector on it so I never bothered to pick up one of the spares you can buy.It's a GOOD case don't get me wrong. I have never used the clip that you can optionally use with it but it looks like it's good quality as well.However if you do not have Hulk hands you might want to look at another Otterbox series. This one means business and I don't want to end up with stitches every time I need to open it up to take out a battery or whatever.So I love Otterbox. I will continue to buy Otterbox. But I will NOT be buying this series. I'm also thinking that when I buy a new case I should probably just buy a new phone too because I'm not sure I can get this thing off again. *laughing*Recommended for those that need series protection for their phones and don't have a need to swap the case or remove it.
2	I understand if this was easy to put on that it would also be easy to come off I get that.  I tried to put it on my phone but I couldn't get it to snap all the way on some of the holders.  I'm sure it would protect very well once it was all snapped into place.  It's not as bulky as the otter box I had for my iphone.
2	I was excited to rip the package open to put my trusted Otterbox on my new galaxy s5. Frankly that's where the excitement stops. The plastic two piece holder which you place your phone in doesn't connect tightly feels real loose over the phone before placing it in the rubber outside protection price. Once inside the remaining rubber piece the volume buttons don't line up properly nor does the power button. The strip at the bottom of the case that's right below the home button is to high basically making you disable the fingerprint scanning portion  of the phone. I believe Otterbox released this case just a little to soon before working the bugs out. I'm using the pelican brand case until Otterbox works the kinks out.
2	easy to loose  ... not properly labeled as to what product  applications  hard  to find what it fits ..quality  is great but  finding a chart for applications is impossible!!
2	I like the product but I'm not excited about it. Very easy to snap on and off.  I haven't tested it out yet because I have other cases that I use as well.
2	UPDATE:You will drop your phone using this case and I never dropped my phone before. It's very slick with no grip on the edges. Thankfully didn't damage the phone which displays the HTC ONE's superior build quality as it was dropped on hard ceramic tile from 36 counter height. Like I said before the clear plastic will and DOES scratch really easily.I did like that you could barely tell that my phone had a case on it and literally had compliments on that fact but the risk of damage is too great for me.Just reinstalled the stock smoked(color can't display the awesome brushed aluminum on back)TPU case for now to protect it.ORIGINAL REVIEW:It does fit snug and snaps into place but very limited edge coverage so won't protect like it should. Feels like it would snap/slip off the edge if dropped not protecting the phone like it should. Polished hard plastic not the TPU rubber/plastic style so it will scratch easier on the back.
2	It shows off your HTC One well but has a few drawbacks. The top and the bottom edges are not covered so protection from dings on two of the edges your device is most likely to fall on is non existent. The way the cut out is over the the volume rocker makes it difficult to use it is fairly easy to get use to it for the volume only but just try and take a screenshot and it is nearly impossible without taking the case completely off. Speaking about taking the case off....pain in the butt. It has a tiny rim around all the edges to secure it on. That rim  if you have any type of skin on your device will peel that skin right off. If you do have a habit of using a protective skin on your devices don't pick this case also. Not a good combination. Also right now this case is about 2 weeks in use and shows much wear as far as the clarity of the plastic. Many scratches. Not nearly the long lasting scratch resistance I was looking for when I switched to the hard case. I had much better luck with a couple other clear TPU cases. One I really liked and will be going back to is the Supcase http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C3H8WLW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_170
2	Only looking for scratch protection from the back of the phone. It doesn't hide the beauty of the phone and hardly adds bulk at all.Mine is completely void of any logos. The picture showed that the boxwave logo was on the back of the case but mine arrived without. Just how I would've wanted it.If you aren't prone to dropping your phone this case is perfect. Well done boxwaveUpdate***After a couple days of using the case I have found it very uncomfortable.  The top and bottom of the case is not rounded.  It's almost sharp.  It's uncomfortable on the fingers.  I switched back to my other case
2	size and shape are a bit awkward but this powerXtender is universal when combined with your iGo products. On its own not as useful.update 09/2012.This product worked great for basic cell phones. However it is not capable of charging either of my Android phones (Galaxy SII Galaxy Nexus) more than ~35% and gets extraordinarily hot in the process. If you want a power extender for a smart phone go with one of the Lithium batteries like the PowerGen mobile juice pack.
0	I purchased this for a trip to Hawaii so I could listen to Pandora on my phone while hanging out on the beach.  It absolutely did not work.  I tried it when my phone was fully charged and the phone battery still drained.  Not worth the purchase and I wish I could get my money back.  Oh well.
0	I know it's only  $4.50 but this is a piece of garbage that is so outdated (made in 2007) that it should be in a museum.  First it comes with no tips.  When I ordered it I thought it would have something other than the base unit.  I haven't used it because I refuse to invest more money in this...it is so old that it probably won't work with my Galaxy S3 and if it does it would probably not be able to power it much.I bought it out of desperation when Hurricane Sandy hit.  I regret buying this and wasting my money.....  P U R E  --  G A R B A G E!
2	I was disappointed in this product.  Not as advertised.  I would not recommend it for use as it doesn't 'grip' the item you set on it.
0	Cellet is garbage.  I had two of their brand cases and both broke soon after buying them.  They claim leather but it is really faux leather aka. plastic and its faux leather is the thickness of a dollar store Condom.
2	This is a very nice looking case and the Droid X fits nicely in it.  As another reviewer stated you have to modify it some so you can attach a charging cable to it.  That's not so bad. But the clip that installs on the case does not stay on securely and if you are getting out of your vehicle or up from a chair the seat belt or chair arm will pop the case right off the clip.  Luckily the case protects it well enough but I still don't like it coming off that easy.
2	I put a hard rigid cover on my Droid RAZR and it doesn't fit in this case.The leather on this case inside and out is very nice.  It is soft and supple and smells like real leather.  I don't like the square emblem they have on the center of the top flap.  I'm not sure what it is supposed to do but it doesn't look nice.  On second thought maybe it is to hold the magnet in place.  Even so they could have picked a nicer emblem or as I prefer no emblem at all.So I have a hard cover on my phone and with that on it will not fit in the case.  I thought I might be able to squeeze it in because leather is somewhat flexible but no matter how hard I tried I couldn't get my phone in this case.  That defeats the whole reason I bought this case.  I did take my cover off and give this case a run around the block.  It seemed to fit well with my cover off.  Howeveras other reviewers have mentioned the clip on the back of this case is prone to fall off if you move in the wrong direction or sit down too swiftly.  No matter how much padding this case has if it is going to fall off my belt constantly my phone is bound to get damaged.I did recycle this case - I gave it to a friend that has a small enough phone to fit in this case cover or not.  I warned her about all the flaws but she still said she would take it off my hands.  She had an ingenious way of solving the clip that snaps out - she super glued it in the slot.  It doesn't move as well but she said it absolutely doesn't fall off her belt.This case was not expensive it has nice leather and my friend is getting to use it therefore I gave it 3 stars since she likes it for her phone.
2	It actually works well for the iPhone 5 also.  Durable and well made.  Comfortable to wear.  My last one broke after about 2 years....and I liked it so much that I reordered the exact same one.Update:  After a couple of months the metal piece on the flap came out.  The magnets seem to be stronger than necessary and put a good tug on the simple method to keep that piece attached.  Still it's inexpensive and I am re-ordering a new one because I like everything else about it
2	I purchased this item from WIRELESS UNLIMITED in Texas. Although it is being sold as a new OEM Blackberry battery allegedly the same as what comes with one's Blackberry I don't think it is. Why? First of all my Blackberry is only 4 months old and its original battery is marked Made in Japan. While this battery at first glance has the same label (quite easy to fake of course) it is actually marked Made in China. Another subtle difference is that the OEM battery that came with my Blackberry listed its milliamps (if I recall 1400 mA). This battery has no designation at all of its amp rating. Now considering that the real thing costs $40-$50 at most cellular retail stores and this item was one-seventh the price what can I expect? Still there is the little matter of false advertising...they are calling this genuine OEM.  The made in China label the lack of a retail package (it arrived in a little plastic pouch unmarked) and most importantly the inferior performance all suggest FRAUD.  Also -- they charged me [...] shipping and handling even though it was sent 1st class in a tiny envelope at a cost of about [...] at most. I would not trust this seller again.
0	You get what you pay for.  The price seemed to good to be true and it was.  The battery didn't last at all and I had to return it immediately.
2	the batter died and then yo uahve to buy and solder a new one in there.  REALLY!  or thow it out and buy a new one for 200.they say they dont make the CS70N anylonger so you have to buy a whole new unit.  Terrible design.im on the phone a good part of the day and should have known better to not buy a more expensive unit.do yourself a favor and call the manufacturer first and ask about stuff like battery life how to replace.  I would have not purchased this if I had know it woudl last only a year or two.
0	If mounted anywhere near your radio which is often the case it will completely kill your reception FM or AM.  Even with nothing plugged into it.  Makes this worthless to me.  Avoid.They need to better shield this!
0	The unit puts out so much RF interference it kills all radio stations and also kills FM traffic alerts on the Garmin. When unplugged all my radios return to normal. It may be due to my car set up. 1998 Honda Accord. 1 12volt plug under the radio. This may be too close.  You may have better results.
2	This device works fine as long as I limit the connections to two devices.  I use the cigarette adapter to power my GPS and the USB adapter to power my phone.  Any additional connections results in the device getting extremely hot.
2	This does kill the FM signal but it doesn't cause interference on AM.  It would be nice if it had an on/off switch.
2	Pros:Fairly easy to set up; pairing is pretty easy.  Audio quality mostly good.Cons:occasional bluetooth artifacts -- popping sounds when there is interference dropouts.  Pitch and speed temporarily increase when unit tries to catch up to realtime -- disorienting.  Dropouts seem to increase when battery is low.Incoming ringtone is a loud high-pitched warble -- painful and mind jarring.Microphone in unit is sensitive to noise -- I have to cup my hand to overcome traffic noise.
2	Pros:Good constructionpairingbattery lifeCons:even though the volume can be set to loud you still hear too much ambient noise while listening to music.Conclusion:If you don't mind hearing everything else while you are listening to music these are excellent headphones.
0	Buying these headphones was a terrible mistake. The sound is flat and lifeless and the volume controls do nothing. I bought these to use with my Palm Pre. I don't know if the problem is Pre related the Pre's bluetooth stack has a lot of deficiencies or if these are just lousy headphones. Either way the combination of the Pre and these headphones is not a good one Palm Pre owners should avoid these. I have a cheap pair of wired headphones that have an order of magnitude better sound when used with my Pre.
2	The sound quality is good WHEN it works.  Although easy to pair with Blue Tooth to the iPhone once I did it and tried it again at the gym I can't get the music to play and of course you probably already know the controls on the Sony Headset don't control the iPod/iphone?  I thought it was really cool at first but after trying to get it to work at the gym for three days running it goes back.  It is also worth mentioning that you can't use regular rechargeable batteries.  It has a built in Sony battery that you have to use its own specific charger for.  Oh goodie something else to recharge and keep up with.  Not worth the headaches.
2	The microphone on the headset is overly sensitive. So sensitive that my peer can not hear me while I walk from a relatively quiet street - background noises cover my speech making the headset useless.
2	my wife and i have both had IGO equipment and although the idea is good the parts are kind of pricey and the power units failed (died) in 1 year or less for both of us.  still i like the concept.
0	I found every piece of the iGo to be inferior quality and not worth the money. I have it all in a box and should toss it as I wouldn't resell something that worked so poorly and was iffy at best to work.
2	The concept is nice: that you carry one set of auto and wall chargers for different devices but change just the tip for each device. In practice I found the following problems:1. Each charger is 3 components: wall/auto unit cable and the tip that goes into the device and these 3 components do not fit securely especially the cable keeps coming out of the wall or auto unit.2. The charger does not come with even one tip. So make sure you order the tip for your device along with the charger. They should have at least enclosed one common mini usb tip in the package. Charger itself is cheap but tips are very expensive - that is where they rip you off.3. You get only one cable. So you have to carry the same cable to your car and then home. Why couldn't they have 2 cables in the package? Keep one in car and one in the house.4. Build is very cheap and shows poor fabrication.5 Instead of a well made bag/box to keep 4 components it comes with a cheap nylon bag which does not hold different tips chargers etc snugly. They keep falling out.The result is that this product leaves you with a bad taste. I would have been better off buying 2 separate chargers -auto and wall- for $5 each from cellularfactory than paying $30 for iGo which comes with only one cable. Good concept but very poorly executed. I would not mind paying more for a well made charger with at least one common tip (mini usb) 2 cables and a good bag/box to hold everything together.
2	THis works well but is not sturdy. This is the 4th or 5th case that has broken just by catchinig on seat belt etc. My husband likes this model but we will probably find a different kind.
2	Took me a bit to figure out my phone was the sound quality issue.  Got that squared and WOW!  I really doubted the raves on the sound but it's good.I have used a few earpieces for work without much sucess on the reciever's end (crackling and can't hear me well) and have found nobody has an issue now.Ear hook could be better as it does come apart on occasion however the thiness of them is a bit more comfortable than the thick ones.  I have not found a really comfortable one that works.  This one is the better of all the one's I've tried.  I find I can pull them away from my ear a bit for comfort and still get good sound.  Stays on no matter what I'm doing.What's even better is wearing both for phone calls.  I don't find myself yelling at clients in the car through a one-piece and since it's not an in-ear you can still hear plenty around you.Battery life is awesome.  Have not had it run out all day listening to tunes and taking calls.  My phone dies quicker. Easy to switch back and forth and it does it automatically when taking calls and hanging up.Lastly the on/off switch is real convenient for disconnecting and it syncs up much faster than any other.  I hate holding the button down to turn off and on with other ear pieces and waiting for disconnect/reconnect.If you are looking for a quality handsfree but want the music too this is the one.  It costs much less than a lot of others claiming great quality unless you buy it in the store.* Following up about ear hook...do not bend to adjust for comfort will eventually break after a few months if you do and is hard to find a replacement for less than $10.  I had to go to ebay to find as it out of stock or not available at most online cell assessory sites including Jabra itself.  Have found the connection to be annoying to the stereo unit.  Would prefer a headset type after I've used it for some time now.** Futher followup: Replacement earpieces did not last more than a couple of months.  Finally had to chuck the whole thing and go to something else.  Trying the ICON for phone calls (fair) and went to the Nokia BH-505 Bluetooth Stereo Headset for stereo music (awesome!)
2	As the title says. The reception of the product is great but the earloop keeps falling off. You can not wear it comfortablly while wearing sunshades.
2	I purchased this Bluetooth headset as a replacement for a Motorola H700 that I had used for about 1.5 years before losing it =(Initially I was excited about the prospect of having a headset that could convert into bluetooth headphones. I used my other bluetooth all the time for work (to connect to my iPhone and my MacBook Pro) and having a stereo headset available for conference calls and product demonstrations would have been really nice. Anyhow enough about me and my usage habits. Here's my review:3/5 stars.It's a solid product but I experienced myriad problems trying to keep it connected to my MacBook Pro and my iPhone. Other users on Amazon have praised it's rock-solid connection but I did not share their luck. While the pairing process itself was simple it failed to stay connected to my MacBook for longer than 5 minutes (very annoying when you are trying to watch a product demo that is 30 minutes long and your headphones continuously cut out). I had slightly better luck with the iPhone. It would stay connected for up to 30-40 minutes (a MUST for long conference calls) but it was totally unreliable after 40 minutes (I had it drop out on two different hour long+ calls last week).Connectivity issues aside it's a real solid performer. The call quality was excellent when connected. I was told that my voice was noticeably better (than my old Motorola bluetooth). Likewise when I could get the headset to stay connected to my MacBook Pro the stereo audio was more than acceptable for a bluetooth connection. It even had more base than I was expecting.Battery life is also quite good. I was using it nearly 3 hours a day between calls and computer usage and I only found myself charging it every 3-4 days.Another nice feature is the screen. I know it seems silly to have a screen on something that is attached to your head most of the time you are using it but I really underestimated the utility. I actually stopped carrying my phone around the office and just took the headset. I could see caller ID check bluetooth battery life and even dial from the (small but amazing for a bluetooth headset) internal phonebook.The one serious issue besides the connectivity that I had with it was how it sat on my ear. It takes a while to figure out how to put it on (HINT: when you put it on swivel the ear hook towards the front end of the ear piece put it next to your ear and swivel the hook back over your ear like you're locking handcuffs). It's important to note that you shouldn't try to fit the little speaker unit inside your ear (even though it TOTALLY seems like it should go in). If you follow my hint above to put it on the speaker will just sit outside your ear comfortably. If you try to fit it inside your ear there is a little nub that will poke the inside of your ear and begin to hurt after just 1-2 minutes of use!!!All told this is a great headset if you can get it to connect. As Mac/iPhone user I had a helluva time. I'll still use it as a back up. I mean c'mon $20 for a stereo bluetooth headset? That's just a crazy good deal. But I will be getting another headset that is more reliable.As a side note I never once in the entire 1.5 years of using it lost connection with my Motorola H700 (for any reason other than the battery dying while it was on). In the week that I've had the Jabra BT8010 I've lost connection 23 times (that I remembered to count).I recommend this as a buy to any PC/non-iPhone user (or any Mac/iPhone user who is a glutton for punishment).One more thing. [..] shipped my order lightning quick. It only took 4 days via USPS from when I placed the order until I received it!
2	This does not charge all of the items it fits. But when it does work it is nice to have.
0	Finally gave up on all their products as the connectors are always iffy. Wouldn't recommend an iGo items. I have several that are in a box. I won't even re sell them.
2	Briefly the BT5020 Headset is Bluetooth 2.0 compliant and it is compatible with Bluetooth 1.1 or higher devices. It was easy to pair with a cell phone and we experienced no major issues using it. My wife a heavy phone users was able to wear and talk trough the BT5020 for hours without experiencing any discomfort.With one exception which I will discuss below all the specs listed in the Amazon's fact sheet are accurate and I see no reason to retype them as part of this review. I should add that the BT5020 'remembers' up to 8 paired devices and according to the manufacturer it can sustain connections with 2 devices at the same time. I did not test this feature.What you get:- The Bluetooth headset itself.- 110-220V charger- Short USB (Type A/Micro-B) cable for charging off a computer.- Small Quick Start Guide with graphic illustrations showing buttons pairing and how to wear it.- 2 silicone gel earplugs to be used with the headset.What I liked:- Comfortable wear.- Light weight.- Long battery life.- Short charge time.- Flexible charging options (charger or off a PC via USB)- Relatively good quality sound - I did read the other reviews but my wife is very pleased with the sound quality and she's a heavy constant user.Issues:- Lacks a storage case.- There seems to be no way to replace the headset vibrating on incoming calls with maybe a beep. My wife likes the vibration feature but I can't stand it and I would have rejected this if it was for me.- Seems to be a subset of a Jabra product with one essential component missing (see below).Unbundled item:The Amazon page states lists among features the following:Multipoint connections allowing simultaneous connection to phone and PC and The headset features Jabra's Multipoint connection functionality enabling it to be connected to two devices at the same time--such as a PC and a phone or music player and phone.The above apply to a product named Jabra BT5020 Multiuse WITH BLUETOOTH HUB. I could NOT find a listing for the plain BT5020 at the Jabra Web site indicating that the product was either discontinued or that this 'exec package' offer is not part of the official Jabra product line. For THAT product (Multiuse with Bluetooth Hub) the specs page states correctly that It connects wirelessly to your Bluetooth mobile phone and simultaneously to your corded desk phone via a discreet Bluetooth hub for ultimate convenience and ease of use with none of the hassle of changing headsets.It should be well understood that this package does NOT include the Bluetooth Hub.Rating:As Bluetooth headsets go this is a good one and my wife will keep it. I will subtract 2 stars for the lack of a case and the unnecessary confusion created by the inaccurate claim of it being able to be paired to 2 devices simultaneously.
2	I originally bought this for my wife's LG-VX8600 (Verizon) but like the other reviewer's noted lot's of static unless I held the phone less than 1 foot away from the headset.I had planned on returning it but decided to try it with my UT Starcom PPC6700 (Sprint) and found that it worked great with it. I've walked at least 20 feet away from my phone before I heard any crackling. It even worked well when I went outside the room.I've never had a BT headset before but I had heard that you really need to have an In-The-Ear type of earpiece for you to hear anything above a silent room. I thought I might not like the fact that this unit didn't have an gel earpiece. I do use a custom-fitted earpiece in my job to monitor audio so I know what it's like to depend on one. But I found that this one worked very nicely without one. I was able to hear quite well in my car and other noiser vehicles. It also doesn't completely block out the surrounding noise when it's not in use. It does come with a directional condom like device but found that it was not necessary even in a loud bare walled cargo van (which is pretty noisy on a freeway).The fit is nice. While I do know that I have it on. It may become less noticable as I use it further. It took litle practice to get to the point of slipping it on my ear with one hand in less than a few of seconds.I think I would have preferred the buttons (at least the answer/end or volume buttons) on the side of the unit rather than the edges but I'll get used to them eventually.I haven't tested the mic in windy conditions yet but in a typical situation inside and outside the audio seemed good considering the mic is no where near my mouth. I'm not sure how it will perform when I have more ambient sound when I make a call though I've not had a problem when I used it in a grocery store.I haven't used it long enough to comment on quality of build. I hoping I can take a beating though it does seem somewhat delicate.I wish the charging port was mini USB but it's even smaller than that. Like a submini USB port if there is such a thing. It does come with a USB charging cable and fortunately I had a cigarette lighter plug with a USB port built in so I can attach the cable and charge it in my car. Unfortunately the cable is only 12 inches long so attaching it while driving isn't easy.Overall I like the design fit and sound. It does deserve the bad rap it got since I experienced it on my wife's phone but for me it's a great device that works nicely.
0	The headset was purchased to pair with the new Storm it was terrible muffled on the called side and sounded like a tunnel on the caller side.  Tried several different phones landline other cell out of area codes and even international same result.  So if your pairing it with the Blackberry Storm don't bother.I returned it and replaced it with the BlueAnt Z9i and what a amazing difference clear as a bell at both ends of the call great noise cancelling and seems to pair with no problems also can pair with 5 devices at once and can switch to the called phone.Hope this helps someone.
2	I had this charger for about 14 months. The connection to the phone is now loose enough to make it unusable. I think it is more an issue with Sony design than the charger itself.Looked at discount store for aftermarket charger and was 12.00. This one is less than 10 bucks with shipping so I am ordering it.All in all this is an ok charger.
0	Worked fine until it stopped working.  I Could hear ok but all the other person could hear was a faint voice. Four months usage. Won't buy another of this brand.
0	I purchased this product based on a CNET recommendation.  CNET has been a reliable source for most of my technology purchases.  This however was a disappointment.  The unit does not eliminate sound effectively volume controls are mushy the microphone/on off switch will not stay retracted resulting in a constantly discharging battery.  It did pair easily and the voice activated controls worked well.  I would not purchase another and would advise others to avoid this model.
2	Originally I had purchased Supertooth II which had a powerful speaker but died within 3 weeks. Blueant customer service told me that they were aware of the problems with Supertooth II and had discontinued it and they replaced it with Supertooth Light which I have used for about 4 months.The voice quality of Blueant Supertooth Light is better than my factory installed Cadillac Bluetooth phone. Speakerphone is fairly powerful for such a small package but the sound is not always crystal clear. Listeners at the other end sometimes complain of muffled voice. Still it is better than using the cell phone itself next to your ear.Pairing with cell phone is very easy and the animated guides at Blueant's web site are very helpful. Battery life is amazingly long sometimes lasting a month! It sticks very securely to the magnetic attachment for the visor. Customer service was fairly helpful but not outstanding took 3 weeks to replace my dead Supertooth II. Construction is a little bit like cheap like Chinese products but overall it is a product that functions decent most of the time.
0	I purchased this after reading the positive reviews.  I should have paid more attention to some of the negative reviews that talked about the microphone wand that acts as an on/off switch.I used it a total of about 6 times and the wand refuses to go back. The mechanism that allows it to retract is not working and as a result its always on.When I went to Amazon to return it it would not let me return saying the last date to return had just passed and there is some vague language about partial credit etc.So I opened a warranty ticket with BlueAnt.  Let's see how that works.I am disappointed that Amazon does not clearly explain what to do with products that go defective after a month.
2	Works fine in the daylight.  Unusable at night since the nonstop blinking blue light right at the edge of the driver's field of vision is so annoying.  I assume the designers were stoned when they decided that would be a good idea.
2	They dont send you the one in the picture. The end that plugs into the (whatever)-pod is much larger. It wont fit with some cases. Not really a problem for me but buyer beware. Also the plug that goes into the (whatever)-pod is made of plastic instead of metal. The whole cord seems cheep but it at 2 bucks for 3 of them its not a bad deal.
2	This retractable sync/charging cable appears to work as advertised.  Quality and/or durability of the retractable part may or may not hold up well but only time will tell about that.  You should look at the diagram on one side of the unit first.  It stated that you Should Not pull on just one end of the line(s) at one time.  Both should be pulled at the same time. After a very brief use it appears that if you pull on both lines at the same time with just the right amount of force and distance that the retractor will catch and you will have just the amount of line distance you need and you can use your hands to plug it in. Pull again equally on both lines and the whole things retracts.
0	Not good.  Cable is super thin and cheap.  Retracting mechanism broke after like 3 pulls.
2	not happy with this purchase although this case is roomy and you can definately fit a phone with a case in it.  The pouch part is also made ruggedly.  But the belt clip expanded on the first day and i couldn't get it to tighten back up.
0	Don't buy It. I have been wearing it one month and already de area of the belt is cracked. I liked the shape model for my S4 with zerolemon super battery. but as I said don't last if you use it each day.
2	This case is ok but alittle short on quality where the belt clip is fastened to the back of the case.  Other than that it fits my phone.  The iphones and the Androids will fit this case.  And the velcrow is very good. You can hear it clear across the room like your getting a waxing job done.LOL
0	I bought this case despite some negative reviews due to needing stuff ASAP as Sprint was shipping me my new S4 and i dread not having everything i need right away..I am using this case for a Samsung S4 with a Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 5200mAh Extended Battery + Black Back Cover (Compatible With ALL Samsung Galaxy S 4 Models) [18 Month Warranty] **NOW WITH NFC / Google Wallet** and the Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 Extended Battery HoneyComb Matte TPU Case / Cover  for the enlarged battery and Door. This case performed great for 2 weeks then the GLUE just stopped holding the seams together for all stress points on the case. I bought mine from  DeCi Accessories. I cannot recommend this case.
2	This case is sturdy and the clip is nice on it. However this case is VERY large and if you do not have a phone large enough to completely fill it it will not velcro closed and keep the phone safe. also there is space on the sides where the phone is not covered so the phone can still be open to dirt water or anything else.
2	This product is for sure large enough for just about any phone on the market and its well made and protect.
2	It does everything it needs to do and it's ridiculously cheap. However it smelled like chemicals when it was new and I had to leave it out in the garage for a few days to let the smell dissipate and the belt clip could be a little sturdier and use thicker/doubled-up stitching. All things considered especially with the price it's not a bad purchase.
0	Stitching coming out after only a handful of occasional uses.  The stitching at the bottom of the belt clip strap is coming out -- about half out now after only a few uses over the past two months.  Otherwise the model seemed perfect for carrying a  Motorola Droid Razor M.  I had written a positive review after the first week that review has been pulled.
0	Someone somewhere has a dark sense of humor.  After ordering a CA-100 cable and waiting for the Brown Truck of Happiness to arrive I discovered that inside the Amazon box was a sealed package festooned with Nokia logo and CA-100 model designation.  The back of the package says Nokia Original Accessories too.  Inside the sealed box is a Nokia branded CA-101D cable.  What this means is that instead of the CA-100 cable that has a USB connector on one end and a Nokia 2mm connector on the other I ended up with a cable that has a micro-USB connector on one end.  So... No joy.  For a $6 cable I'm not going to burn gasoline and time returning it. I can always use this cable with my other devices. However I cannot recommend this vendor at all.
2	Update two years later: The unit's red light always stays on now and it doesn't amplify the signal any more.  I don't know if that's because I upgraded to a Motorola Droid 2 or what.  But I always get 2 to 3 bars at my desk now so I don't really need it any more anyway.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall I'm pleased with the zBoost YX300 zPersonal Cell Phone Signal Booster unit which I purchased to help with signal strength in my home office.  It makes a definite difference.  Not huge but big enough to meet my needs and well worth the price.I work out of my home office and use my cell phone (currently a Palm Centro on Verizon) at my desk regularly.  Standing out on my sidewalk I get three bars.  In most of my house I get 2 bars.  For whatever reason sitting at my desk I would occasionally get two bars but usually only one and sometimes none.  After adding the zBoost I always get two bars at my desk which is a critical difference.  I had hoped that I would get 4 bars at my desk but that didn't materialize. But I'll settle for always having at least two bars because now my calls don't drop and my voice quality is good.I found the setup pretty straightforward with the exception of the suction cups on the antenna end not sticking very well even to a slick surface.  I solved that problem with an adhesive cable tie base attaching the antenna to it with a couple of plastic cable ties.  Fortunately the suction cups on the base unit stick to the glass just great.It is crucial to observe the distances specified in the instructions which are pretty scanty on the back of the box.  My base unit is stuck to the window at approximately the same height as the antenna (about five feet up) and the two are ten feet apart give or take a couple of inches and have a clear line of sight between them.  I sit midway between the two i.e. five feet from each.  Both base and antenna are vertically oriented if that makes any difference.  The idiot light on the base is always green.It is also crucial to connect the antenna cable to the base first and only then plug in the power. The light will be red and stay that way for ten or fifteen minutes while the unit acquires signal towers etc.  Once it turns green you can accurately guage the results.So just three stars because I had hoped for more bars but the ones I got have made a critical difference to me.  I would recommend this device to anyone with similar needs - just keep your expectations modest.
2	It works for me but just barely. I am using it in my office. My office does not have an outside wall and I was getting zero to 1 bars without it. When I first installed this I was able to find a location next to the ceiling where I had two bars consistently. I located the window unit there but even though my phone showed 2 or 3 bars my calls broke up severely.A few days ago I put the window unit above the ceiling where I had three bars and it started working. However the only way it works is if I leave my phone sitting next to the antenna and use my bluetooth. If I move my phone as little as 6 away I go to 0-1 bars. Any farther and I have no bars.My other big problem is that if the antenna is too close to the window unit there is a back feed and it stops working. That wouldn't be a huge problem except the wire isn't all that long and once you run it down the wall and across the room it is nearly impossible for it not to pick up the antenna and it stops working. Since installing it in the ceiling this problem went away but I can no longer run the wire all the way to the floor and over to my desk. It looks pretty bad and it may cause me problems with my boss. I wish I could add another 12-20 feet so I can install it neatly.Bottom line. If you don't have at least 3 bars where you locate the window unit and you can't leave your phone sitting next to the antenna then I would recommend you stay away from this item. One other comment is that I think it should be designed to work the other way around. The black antenna should mount on the window and the main unit should be located near the phone. Running both power and the antenna wire into the ceiling or to a window is just plain stupid. But for $50 it is working for me and I'm happier than I was.
0	I've tried several of these cell phone signal boosters and I have to say not one of them is worth a dime.  Do they boost your cell signal?  Maybe...a little....sort of... not really.  Yes the bars on my Sprint phone do jump a tad when I turn this on but it's barely noticeable and certainly not worth the exorbitant price.  This one just feels like tech snake-oil.  No moving to different locations made no difference.  Nothing did.  This thing is just a placebo.  Don't bother.
0	The unit I received contained no instructions; no problem go online to company site to get them.  Easy to install put the unit near window or anywhere you have service (at least one bar) then put the antenna at least ten feet away.  The antenna cable is only 20' so it is difficult to go further than that unless you are going to have cable in front of you then the next problem is that you can not have the cell phone near the unit so in my 15' x 12' office I could not move the unit and antenna around so that I could get a green light as you also have to have phone within 6' of antenna.  Gave up after an hour of moving all over only to get a green light for a few moments then back to red.  Did nothing to improve signal since I could not get a green light presumably this would have indicated that I have a signal that my cell phone then would pickup.  I may try the other four person Sprint device the company has?
2	We put this on our window to improve reception in our apartment it helped slightly but not that much.  I think it had a hard time keeping the signal because the signal was still pretty weak by the window.  When we moved apartments that had even worse reception this didn't help at all.  My suggestion is only get this if you have a spot where you get a strong signal and need to extend it.
0	I ordered 3 of them 2 of them came without an issue but the 1 that had problem it got very very difficult to get it replaced the company I ordered from told me to go to Jabra directly at Jabra website after entering all the info as per requested they simply send me an email to how to resolve it and after trying that and notify them again via email (no phone #) and I've asked for an exchange and again they replied to ask me to do the same process again it's never ending. Bad customer service.
2	There are a lot of options when it comes to styluses. This is a great short lived stylus. I was looking for something other than the cheap rubber tipped styluses that are everywhere and this one worked great for a while. The tip is rubber covered with  mesh it's size is nice being much longer than other styluses out there giving it a more comfortable and natural fit in your hand.. And don't get me wrong it works great it slides across the screen nicely without leaving smudges or marks but the mesh cover over the tip comes apart or will rip over time I have purchased 3 over a matter of a few months and finally upgraded to a Wacom. Which I'm still not overly happy with.
2	I used this stylus for a couple months and really enjoyed it. I am a grad student and take a lot of notes on my iPad notes. I was excited to try something new with a non-rubber tip but found out quickly that it isn't as sturdy as advertised. I really wish the tip would have lasted longer and that is why I haven't bought another one.
0	This stylus was used for two days and the mesh surrounding the tip began separating. At this point it is usable but not reliable. I will not purchase this item again. I also bought the Trent Limir Dual purpose stylus and it is working quite well.
2	I was a little less than impressed with this item simply because the next day I saw a similar item for sell at Walmart. Save your money on this as it isn't any better for your capacitive screen than the cheaper alternatives.
0	This one is not accurate. I have compared it against several high quality meters at work and the 4460 is always off but often by a different direction or a different amount.I miss the display in amps the older model had. It was very useful for determining circuit loads in cases where an amp clamp was not convenient.It also hogs both outlets of a standard duplex receptacle so the other one is covered and unusable. (Yes a pigtail would help)I e mailed the company twice about the inaccuracy and inconsistency and did not receive a reply.It became more and more inaccurate and finally died.
0	UPDATE: The display has failed completely on this product. While the buttons 'beep' the readout is blank. What a POS.  Now back to my initial review.I placed a 5000 BTU ceramic heater on this device to see actual usage. The device showed around 11 amps constant pull but I left it plugged in overnight while the heater ran.  Several hours later when I checked the Kill A Watt again it was warm and its receptacle had deformed around the plug making it impossible to remove.This device is supposed to have a NEMA-rated outlet capable of 15 A draw. This is what customers use a Kill-A-Watt for to monitor real time use. Clearly this one could not handle prolonged use and I wonder if I was sold a gray-market product.
2	Another item i didn't receive and want to clear from the list.  It measures current well Work i guess technically. Whether you use that info to reduce your electricity usage or not is up to you.
2	The P4460 is an ok product but customer support is non existant. They never answer the phone so I left 2 voice mail messages & 1 email. They never responded.Update 10/09/10 They finally responded by email so I changed my rating from 1 to 3.Mike NY
2	I used this on an window unit AC... It was rated to work fine with my power rating of AC unit but just short of a year it died.. I took it apart and the internal fuse that is not designed to be replaced has failed..
2	The product works fine and for the money is a good deal however the plastic faceplate on mine fell off (a little scotch tape did the trick)and it would be easier to use if it had a backlight. That being said it's probably just the glue on this one that went bad on the face plate because the other four of them my company has have had no such problem. The lack of a back light though makes you need to use a flashlight when you use it in tight quarters or under desks. I'd gladly pay another $5 -$10 if it had a backlight. Good devive though and pretty fast when you use it right. Not hard to learn either.Wayne
2	This item seems to work ok for larger wattage equipment.  I tried it on a power charger for a cell phone and a camera battery charger.  It didn't register any kWH or any any $ for these items.  Dissapointing.
2	Pros: Looks nice relatively cheap.Cons: Fragile belt clip and leather clasp.For the price you get a holster that will last you approximately 4-6 months assuming you don't break the belt clip.  I recommend the Seidio line of cases for Blackberries over any other manufacturer.  If you want an inexpensive temporary solution for your phone this one does just fine.
2	doesnt stay clipped to my belt falls off easy.  hard to get my blackberry out.  Wouldn't recommend this product.  took way to long to get.
2	First of all do not buy this if you have an 8330 Curve (the CDMA variant from Verizon) because the phone will tend to wobble around in the case.  (Unless you want that of course).If you want a snug fit get a case marketed for the 88xx series or just look for another case for the 8330 Curve.I don't know if my experience with this case applies to the 8300 8310 8320 however.The case isn't too shabby but it said Sprint not Blackberry on the silver button.I've had no problems with it so far.That being said I would not recommend this unless you're getting one for cheap.  If you buy it off amazon it can cost you anywhere from $5 to $10 which really isn't that much for a leather case.  If you're just looking for something to put your phone in then this case probably won't disappoint for the price.However If you're looking for something a bit better (and really you wouldn't have to look that far) then the price will come up but quality will greatly increase too.My dad just got a Blackberry 8800 and got two cases by accident and gave me one.  And I like it a lot more.
2	I got this on the recommendation of a friend. After speaking with him while he was using this headset which was crystal clear I asked my buddy what kind of headset he was using. He told me this one. So I picked this up on Amazon.I used it with a Sprint Sanyo phone and the performance was terrible. I lived with it since I knew I was going to upgrade soon. I upgraded my phone to a iphone with AT&T; it was even worse. Turns out my buddy was using a Samsung phone. We think that this works great coupled with a Samsung phone but it seems to dislike other brands. In the end it ended up getting washed in a pair of my pants and didn't work any more. Good riddance!I picked up a Plantronics headset and have not looked back!
2	I tried two of them. Both would not hold a charge. I hated the charger. It has to be in the case to charge. The company I ordered from said &#34;new&#34; but it was clearly not in both instances. I'm still searching for an &#34;in ear&#34; model that works.
0	Maybe I was a bit harsh in the title but I had to put something out there that would grab  your attention.  I want to save you the trouble that none of these other reviews did for myself.  Most of the reviews were great so I bought it.  I have to say the sound is pretty decent very similar if not slightly worse than my wep200.  The wep410 looks very stylish but it just doesn't FIT RIGHT IN THE EAR.  It feels like it is going to fall out and it doesn't sit at the angle where it is pointing from your ear to your cheek which is what the wep200 does.  When it sits at the angle it is NOTICEABLY flaring outwards.  It looks like it is sticking out of your cheek at a 30-40 Degree angle which looks extremely odd.  I tried all three different sized earbuds but no luck with any of them.  I can get it to fit in my ear but the fit of the earbuds is VERY poor.  I even got my father to try this headset to see if I had deformed ear canals but they also didn't fit him right.  I really wish I could return this but since I have opened it I can't.  Sadly I had to give the headset to my father.  (He doesn't care how poor the fit is as long as he can use it for hands free calling in the car)Bottom line is that you SHOULD NOT buy this headset but you should buy the Samsung Wep200.  That Headset is excellent for the price and very light in weight  That headset is also the one you want if you like ear buds like myself.  I don't like big bulky Android looking Blue tooth sets that take up a bunch of room.
0	I paid about $90 for this.  It would not stay in my ear.  I tried every ear adapter every way possible. It fell out of my ear every time.  I was lucky this happened in my car most of the time and I was able to find it.  Finally it fell out somewhere and I lost it.  I don't think I got 4 days use out of it.  Do you want to feel totally ripped off?  Get this product pay a lot of money for it and watch it disappear.It is worse than that. Is comes with a junk plastic case that is useless for storing the charger and other stuff.  If you pay this much money for something they should provide a nice case for storing it and the charger manual and shorty cable.  the little box they provide does not hold together. So you will need a new case for it right away.  All these little bits and pieces are guaranteed to be scattered and lost.Also my first charger failed.  I discovered this by plugging it into my computer using the USB connection.  Jabra gave me all sorts of headaches to get a new one.  It took several messages where they asked for a serial number.  Try to find that?  I couldn't.  Then after exchanging several email over a stupid charger they told me I had to remove the rubber earpiece to find the serial number.  I couldn't read it--it was too small to read.So if want to blow a fuse in anger.  Get this. Have an Aneurism stroke or headache and get treated like C$%P by there customer service.
2	The over-the-ear piece is a not a good fit for my ears. Moreover they are extremely fragile and prone to breaking. Within 5 minutes of getting the phone out of the box I broke the ear piece just trying to get the headset over my ear. I put the headset in my piece and bent the second piece. The plastic piece covering the control buttons seemed very cheap also and I think it would be a matter of time before that broke as well. I generally take good care of my headsets and electronic equipment so if the headset seemed fragile to me it probably will for most. Also as a woman with a small head the headset just felt clumsy and big. On the upside the acoustics seemed decent but then I only used the headset once and decided to return it.
2	[Good]Decent battery life.Decent looksFits somewhat comfortably[Bad]You'll sound great to the person you're speaking with. Unfortunately you won't be able to hear the person that you called.Not worth the price
2	I am pleased with the sound quality of the device.  Volume level is adequate even when on noisy roads and people on the other end have actually remarked positively about the level of quality.  I only wish the Jawbone engineers had stopped tinkering when they perfected the audio quality and not designed a fit system so complicated and brittle that it impairs my ability to actually use the device.The ear loop has about the consistency (and strength) of a paper clip.  The result is something so flimsy that Jawbone Inc. considers earloops to be a consumable.  After receiving the Jawbone as a gift this holiday season I was unable to use it as all of the included earloops snapped off within the first day of use.  Needless to say I didn't start using the product until about February after waiting for customer service to send me replacements.  Any future earloops they tell me will have to be purchased for $2.50 each!The sound is great but like others on here the fit leaves something to be desired.  This after trying the infinite combinations of earloops and earbuds the unit comes with.  Turning my head quickly often requires a readjustment even with the tightest fitting earloop.  I realize that all ears are different but I've had cheap headsets that fit great because the engineers did not try to over-engineer the fit process.I am sure there are other great sounding bluetooth devices in this price range that are better constructed and will provide less aggravation.  It's for that reason I can't recommend this product since its construction makes it completely unreliable.
2	The sound quality is really very good far better than the Jawbone 2. I did have the ear insert plastic break requiring glueing. The thing that I despise about this headset is the earloops and how easily they break. You can bend them maybe a dozen times before they fatigue. Aliph has been pretty good about sending out free loops but I am on my third pair of free ones. I just broke a new one after a week and I was super careful to not bend it! I am going to ditch this and try the Blueant as I am sick of handling this bluetooth headset with kid gloves.
0	Ok me and my partner wanted this Jawbone because of their advertising of noise canceling so we ordered 2. Once they arrived we put them on the charger. One Jawbone broke before even first use: after the battery was fully charged half of the Jawbone came off with the charger when we tried to disconnect it - horrible charger connection. So we sent one back for replacement. I started using the other one that's left. The Jawbone connected ok to my Motorola Q but when my phone rings the headset did not; i press the answer button - nothing; I press the answer button on the phone and phone works like there is no BT headset connected. Tried this with 4 different phone same result. So the next day we sent the second one for replacement.A week later two new headsets arrived. We charged them connected to the phones and ... both are malfunctioning again. On one we could hear the caller but caller did not hear anything. Tried on 4 phones - the same. We sent it for replacement. The second Jawbone had such loud statick and cracking in the audio that we sent the other back the next day.A week later two new headsets arrived. One would not connect to any phone. Second had the same cracking noise. We tried to call Aliph the manufacturer (no toll free number available for support) for 4 days left numerous messages - no one ever returned not one call. Sent them numerous email messages - nothing back.So I would highly recommend to stay away from this very undeveloped product. The idea is great they just need to complete their testing phase as this product is still in very early testing.
2	I read all the reviews here before I bought my Jawbone so I was a bit worried that I might have some of the problems people described with the earbud not fitting or the charger not working properly.  I'm happy to report that I experienced neither of these problems.  The headset fits perfectly around my ear it doesn't slip even when I'm moving and I'm barely aware that it's there.  Also the charger fits snugly into the socket and I haven't had any trouble with loose connections.Sound quality seems to be great the people I talked to say they can hear me fine even in loud environments.  As mentioned in other reviews this headset does not cancel wind noise probably because wind noise is highly variable.  So don't expect to use this on a gusty day or while riding in a convertible.My BIGGEST COMPLAINT with this product is the clunky charger.  Why does every electronics company insist on introducing their own charger socket standard when there is a perfectly fine standard (Mini USB) already out there?  Motorola phones BlackBerries most PDAs and many other headsets all use this standard charging socket.  This means I don't need to lug around an extra charger as I can charge my phone and headset off the same charger.  Unfortunately the Jawbone charger is completely nonstandard... I can't even get an iGo power tip for it.  Finally the charger itself is poorly designed.  It's another huge brick that takes up two power sockets.  The rubber cover that covers the socket on the headset when you're not charging removes completely and I'm sure I will lose it within a month.  You'd think that a company that could design such a cool headset would put a little more thought into the charger.However you buy a headset to talk clearly and on that point this one delivers.
2	I wish I could report a positive review of this headset.  What little I was able to use of it it seemed fine.  However it rests at the bottom of a trash can beside me in the hotel I am in after removing the charging cord for JUST THE THIRD TIME.  The first two times it was difficult and I could tell it was going to be a problem.  So yesterday I found a video on YouTude that showed how to properly remove the charging cord without damaging the headset.  I am sure the video was correct but it did not help.  Perhaps the headset was too damaged from the first two removals.Either way I don't need a product that requires I be so delicate with it perfomring an operation that I would need to do at least 3 times a week.I am obviously not sayng that you can;t purchase this product and have a happy relationship with it.  But you can NOT take the removal of the charging cord from the headset lightly and I just do not need to be burdened with this.  I want to detach and GO - not spend 3 minutes sweating the removal.Headset might be good but I'll not be recommending these and I'll not be inclined to buy another Aliph product again.
2	Proper fitment very hard i purchased ear jells with it and still had a hard time. Everyone i spoke with on this headset had nothing but complaints with static and said i sounded muffled and had a very hard understanding me. My side sounded pretty good but had to keep volume at max. I was using it with a Verizon GZ one so that possibly was an issue don't know if anyone else has had this problem.
2	If you have the original Jawbone I wouldn't recommend upgrading to this newer model. I purchased the JB2 because I liked the JB1 so much.The JB2 syncs right out of the box provided that you remember to hold the power button on for 7 seconds or so from the off position to sync it for the first time. After that its pretty self explanatory.The original JB1 had a nice sound to it. The new JB2 sounds like cheap car speakers that are turned up too loud. It distorts sound easily at higher volumes. It is very lightweight and relatively comfortable. Let's face it - human ears come in different shapes and sizes. Hopefully yours will be the same shape and size as one of the three ear buds provided with the new JB. They eliminated the old tear drop shape earbud from the new model which is disappointing since I found that one to be the most comfortable fit. You will find that none of your old JB1 accessories will work with the JB2. This includes the earbuds and loops.I would have liked to see them improve on what they started with rather than make a lighter one that sounds worse. If I knew now what I knew then I would not make the leap for the new one just yet. I feel like whatever improvments were made were quickly lost in sound quality. For $60 you can still get a 1st generation that sounds better.The JB2 has lots of room for improvement. If the sound quality were brought up to par with the JB1 and it included the teardrop earbud I'd give it 5 stars. In summary its about prioritization. If sound quality is your top priority get the JB1 and save some cash. If comfort is more important to you than great sound you may really like the JB2.  Despite the harsh criticism I like the unit a lot. After getting used to the earbud I don't even realize I'm wearing it. After a couple hours though it starts to hurt.
2	I love the technology on this product works great. However the ear buds given with this product are awful they work for about 24hrs then the stickem fades off and you can't keep this bluetooth in your ear more than 10 min at best. I did read the other reviews and got the mini-gels in the mail today much better now.
0	The Jawbone bluetooth headset is not really made very well and is a lot worse than people seem to give it credit for. Parts fall off after a short time and it is very cheaply made. It looks metal but really is cheap bendy plastic material.Further once you set it up you can only use it on one ear. Other headsets (like Plantronics ones for example) allow you to swivel the earloop to switch ears if you get tired of using it on one ear. The Jawbone doesn't do this.While the Jawbone's noise cancellation does seem good that's about all it has going for it because your voice still sounds muffled soft and digital-like. Further the Jawbone is too big and bulky to comfortably put it into a pocket to take with you.But my main complaint is with the Aliph Jawbone company customer service itself-they are absolutely horrible. They advertise on their website that the Jawbone has a 1 year manufacture warranty to the end consumer. But my Jawbone broke and when I contacted them about getting warranty service on it they rudely informed me that they only provide warranties on units bought directly from their own website. If I bought from some other retailer it has ZERO warranty! I'm not sure whether or not this is even legal since I'm not a lawyer but do believe it reflects very poorly on the company that they don't even stand behind their own products.I would never recommend buying this headset or any other made by Aliph.
2	.This outdated model only charges at a 500mA rate. That's fine for clamshell phones but it's half-speed for iPhone or any smartphone. I did not test it with iPad which needs 2000mA for full-speed charging.- - - Alternatives - - --Anker Dual USB 3.6 Amp Car Charger-PowerGen Dual USB 3.1 Amp Car Charger
2	Good price and seems reasonably well made... but wiggles in my Accord's socket.  (And oddly is hard to remove.)
2	I must have read more than 30% of the reviews on Amazon about the product. Nonetheless I decided to ignore the iphone 4 users that complained about not working and thus relaying on the product description. Alas that was an awful choice. After connecting it and displaying the charging symbol about 2 minutes later it warned me the device does not support charging. I tried 3 more times and every time it kept dropping so I decided to leave it as such even worse the battery seemed to have turned hot. It does charge other usb devices but it failed to deliver the purpose of its purchase: charge my iPhone 4.
2	I took the item out of the package and plugged it into the 12v...went to put my ipod USB in and the plastic piece was already loose and falling out.  Thank goodness amazon is so great with returns.  I'll order another and see if I can get one that isn't broken.  This does look like a nice quality piece if it works...
2	This is a great little usb charger for the price.  But I bought it specifically for the IPAD.  It would only charge my IPAD while it was sleeping.  I have many other devices that charge via USB so I'll be keeping this one since it's got the 2 slots but I'll be getting a different one just for the IPAD.
0	out of the box it smells like cheap plastic and burning electronics... I'm afraid to plug this thing up to my iphone 4s... This thing is super cheap as in thin metal alloy poorly molded plastics it doesn't even have a UL certification...I'm guessing this cost less than 50 cents a unit to manufacture and it shows unfortunately... on a plus side the box it came in looked nice
0	Product looks solidly built. The plastic feels velvety smooth. The N85 doesn't charge on this but that's a Nokia issue not USB device issue. The ipod touch 2nd Gen charges tho. So it works.I thought it was going to be too high for my VW jetta since it sticks straight up but there's enough space there to stick whatever you want to charge.Product works! Mygearstore shipped it quickly. Not as fast as the Prime 2 day but it was fast enough.UPDATED Jan2012: After 2 years the product just stopped working. Green light would flicker in/out. Threw it out.
0	stopped working. on top of that it works then stoppes working every 10 seconds. makes phone go haywire. broke my ford mustang's power slot because the prongs are too heavy duty and large it pulled the slot out. Do not buy. Buy Motorola micro use charger. Good.
2	We own several Palm Pre's and wanted to use this dual charger to power them up in our car. Unfortunately this device can't provide sufficient power to charge 2 at once. It can charge one Palm Pre at a time but can't charge up 2 at a time.If you have cell phones or devices that need 800-1000ma each this charger can't do it. Total power out seems to be about 800ma split between the two USB ports.Other than being weak in the power department the unit appears to be well constructed it does fit 2 USB cords comfortably and has a charge indicator light so you know when its in use.
2	The package on this product is misleading. On the package you will find an American flag. But in the fine print it reads Engineered in the USA Manufactured in China.If you're boycotting China read the packaging.
2	Purchased this as a second model in place of Scosche reVIVE II Dual USB Car Charger for iPad and only used an iPhone 4 with it.  It stopped working completely after about 2 months while I was on a road trip.get the better unit....
2	If you are planning on using this to charge smartphones be very weary.  This charger splits the total 1 amp output between the two usb ports. This means that each port will get at max 500 milliamps.  This is not enough for most smartphones today.  When using the GPS on my palm pre my phone will actually LOSE battery life with this charger charging the phone.  I gave it to my wife to charge her regular phone which works just fine.
0	You are left eared. The 90 degree turn to fit the ear bud turns the wrogn way so it pops off too easily. The sound form this device is decent but not worth the price for all the hassel of putting this on my ear and taking it off again. Also the earbud kept falling off when not in use. Poor design. I purchased this because it had so many good reviews which is why I'm writting this one.Great sound if you can keep it on your ear and keep it from falling apart on you. So for me it was a total waste of my money.
2	As many other reviewers have said these things have a bad mounting design but I found the solution to these problems. As another reviewer mentioned Jabra MiniGels are the solution and I tried them. They greatly improved the sound quality and you can illiminate the earloop altogether. I bought them from Hello Direct for $5.50.
2	This headset works pretty well with good noise canceling but it won't stay attached to my ear so the part that rests on my face loses contact.  At most it will stay on my head for 10 minutes. I find myself repeatedly twisting the thing back into place.  The second one I got (the first was missing parts) came apart when I tried to unplug it from the charging cable. Jawbone does not seem to offer any other buds (not even spares) so I just ordered some Acoustibuds in the hope that I can actually use it. If they don't work I will try a hack I saw with a Jabra eargels product - that involves cutting up the supplied earbuds and gluing the eargels to the locking piece. I will update this review once I get it to work (or not)
2	Considering the fact that many of the cases currently available for the iPhone utilize a magnet for closing which may or may not interfere with an iPhone I wanted a case that featured a Velcro closure. The DLO Leather Holster Case is strong and fits close to the hip. The clip is VERY tight and difficult to slide onto even the thinnest of belts but I believe this to be an asset; there is absolutely no way this case will ever slip off your belt. The real test for this case will be how well it stands up to daily wear. As long as the clip does not break and separate from the holster I will remain very pleased. I have not noticed a lack of protection from the open corners of the case. The phone removes easily when needed but is snug within the case. Though I have only used the case for about two weeks now I am very pleased with it and would recommend it without hesitation.UPDATE August 16 2009- As noted above my concern with this case was that the belt clip might become loose with wear and that has been the case. I would downgrade my rating on this item to three stars.
2	the leather wrap on the belt clip has worn out. now the metal belt clip shows and the worn out leather pieces are unmanageable. now I'm looking for a new one. otherwise the case was quite functional.
2	I love the DLO case it fits my iphone perfectly and is very convienent to use but as I read in other reviews (which I ignored) the Belt Clip does indeed go bad after about 6 months.  It tears away from the leather backing and then the phone can just drop off your waist. Because of the really good padding on this case you may not even know that it dropped and some lucky person walking behind you will get a free Iphone.I am on my Second DLO case so this is not some unlucky fluke there is a defect in the way the Belt clip is bonded to the leather case and believe me when it starts to rip away its only a matter of days before the phone and leather case fall away from the clip.
0	Like the clean sleek look but didn't last it broke in 4 weeks will not buy again...
2	The iPhone really needs a horizontal case like this one. It's a bit long and wearing it on your hip vertically makes it uncomfortable and unwieldy when you sit down. Whereas a vertical case eliminated this problem. In terms of looks I feel horizontal and vertical both look equally as cool but a horizontal case is a lot more convenient at least to me.This DLO case is nicely made and seems durable but unfortunetly there is a flaw in the design: the exposed open parts can make your iPhone very vunerable to scratches. I noticed a fairly deep scratch on the back of my iPhone right where the middle opening on this case is. It could have happened from a zipper metal button or most probably from a rivet on my jeans coming in contact with the back of the iPhone through the slot. I am switching to another case that covers more of the iPhone.Just a side note about rubber iPhone cases: I don't like the feel of the rubber cases at all-they feel weird in the hand. And the rubber cases tend to stretch out over time and this lets in dust and grit which can scratch the iPhone. Also Apple recommends you not charge the iPhone will in a rubber case because the heat will not be able to dissipate. This means you have to keep taking it out of the rubber case and putting it back in every time you charge. You can see that these types of cases are less than ideal.
0	I wish i can give this a negative star!!! the day it came i plugged it in the car and to my phone and it worked great for a few min. i then unplugged it and threw it in the glove box for a few days and when i when i go to use it - it no longer worked after a few days of sitting in my glove box. terrible.
2	I bought three of this charger the first was more than a year ago and it was good but I lost it so I ordered another two.I expected a much faster charging rate with the 950mAh. It charged my Samsung S III from 3% to 14% in around 22 minutes!Very slow!
2	I have used three of these and they worked well for about 5 or 6 months but then died for really no reason. one lasted longer but the connection became loose and if not in the exact spot it wont work. I would think these could last for at least 1 year or so but guess not. good price but maybe that's why...
0	The charger worked great at first but after 5 months of use it died! Light still comes on but it won't charge anything. Of course the return period ended after 30 days so I guess I'm out of luck.
2	I've had this charger for over a year it gets very light use and it stopped working. What happens is the microUSB connector doesn't make good contact and we have to wiggle and finagle the cable to get it to work and even then it only works for a few seconds until you hit a bump and the cable vibrates and loses its connection. I've had the same issue with mini usb to micro usb adapters from Motorola - bought half a dozen of them and none of them work reliably. I won't buy a motorolla micro usb connector again. The media bridge cables are the best they feel like they click in when you connect them very solid. Motorola? Not so much.
0	Used this in my car.  While it was working it was great.  Nice big blue light to let you know it's plugged in.  Some of the other chargers have tiny lights that are only visible from one side.  this big transparent power indicator light can be seen from both sides.The design of the charger is great.  It's just WAY too fragile.  The plug had issues 5 weeks after I got it so now I'm looking for another one (but obviously not a Motorola).I'm disappointed I thought a Motorola product would last longer.
2	When I first received this charger I loved it. It definitely charged very quickly for a car charger. The price was great too. But now after about 6 months I find that it has stopped working after periodic use and careful handling. No power was flowing through the device at all. I don't know if this will be helpful for anyone. Maybe I just got a dud. But I wanted to make people aware that there could potentially be an issue with that.
2	I don't know what the deal is with all of the great reviews.I've been using this in an Infiniti with a Galaxy S2 for the last few months but now when I connect it it just DRAINS MY BATTERY.  It does nothing except steal power. Most of the time the phone won't synch with the charger but when I do get that little sound that means it's synching it won't charge.What a waste - are we expected to just buy a new one of these every few months?  It's a car charger -- it sits in my console out of sight barely touched most of the time.  How is it that it just stops working?  I have two other chargers in my house that I just abuse on a regular basis moving them around coiling them up changing outlets where I connect them and I've been getting steady use out of them for nearly two years!  Mighty Motorola can't make a car charger that lasts longer than a cheap no-name flea market usb charger?I am disappoint...
2	I loved it until it stopped working. The wire connection somehow developed a shortage and I was always jiggling the wire to reestablish power.
0	This charger worked well for a few months and then stopped working. Keep in mind that the blue light can be very distracting when driving at night. I connected it to the port on the back of the arm rest to minimize the light's distraction.
2	Maybe I received a faulty one. Mine averages 50-100 mA when charging my SGS3. Estimated time to charged &#62; 24 hours!Bad connector perhaps - it shows as connected / disconnected repeatedly.It appeared to top up my Plantronics Bluetooth Headset - the M50 - however.
2	Fast charging short lived. Died 8 months after getting it. It's likely I was sold the knockoff version you see mentioned in some pics but it did charge VERY FAST.
0	Great price and it seems to be working for a lot of people.But.. with GPS turned on HTC Sensation and Samsung Galaxy S 4G either stayed at current charge or very slowly gained a little. I stopped using it after a few weeks.  I will have to look for a charger with a faster recharge rate (amps?)
2	Worked great for a while. Just stopped working.  Not sure why. I paid 5 dollars for it. So no big deal
2	It works but not like the new I I got  this should charge faster
2	Its a fast charger but only lasted under a year.
2	This is a nice charger but after a few months it wasn't charging unless I held it in a specific way to the phone. I think the connection within the phone got touchy. Worked great when it worked but no longer working properly.
0	This has nothing to do with whether or not it's a cheap knock off my primary beef with this charger after living with it for over a couple of years is the BRIGHT BLUE light it gives off. At night it's hard to ignore it it's too bright and distracting when driving.
2	MICRO versus Mini USB is the warning here.  If you see this sizing and understand it then it's good for your cell phone.  NOT mine with REGULAR mini USB.  Not a complaint about the product just the confusion about the size terminology.  We have passed these two items to folks who DO have MICRO USB phones to use in their autos.
2	It work great when it did. It only worked for a month then it would charge my phone anymore.  Do not buy.
0	My original review was best mobile charger I've owned.  I even bought one for my girlfriend after she saw mine.  Now in less than 3 months both are failing.  It starts with a poor connection at the phone where you have to wiggle it or place it in a certain position to charge and devolves into not being able to charge at all.  Mine is a complete loss and hers is on the way out.  If I just had one and it failed I wouldn't give such a poor rating but both failing together lets you know there is an inherent flaw in the design.  I've very disappointed because it was an excellent charger during the brief time it worked.
0	Product stopped working after only 4 months.Amazon referred me to Motorola for the 1 year manufacturer warranty.After calling Motorola 6 different times (of course an India call center) and even more emails (all not responded to) I was told that the product is out of stock and they tried to send me a wall charger as a replacement .  They didn't understand that the product that I was executing the warranty for was a car charger.Still not resolved.
2	My only gripe is that after about a year they quit working for no apparent reason.  Then you have to buy another
2	Is not for the iPhone 5 this should be fixed in the search criteria.  I have no use for this and will not spend my money to send it back.  Thought the brand was good and to my surprise does not fit my phone.
0	doesn't work with Samsung S3... it stops charging every few seconds... will try to send back and now for a few more words... no it still doesn't work
0	Merchant claimed to have mailed the item but it never arrived.  Rather than resending another merchant finally agreed to a refund.  This is a good one to stay away from although he did finally refund my money so I guess he gets a couple of points for that.  I would think that a reputable merchant would have suggested a replacement option but none was offered to me.
2	This is a very nice charger but it does not fit my iphone 4 like it said it would. I am dissapointed.
2	I only used this a handful of times before the connector wasn't making a strong connection to the phone any longer.  When that happens my phone will charge only if I hold the cable to the phone and everything is aligned perfectly.  Otherwise as the car hits bumps it might charge for a minute and then not charge for a minute.  And yes it's the cable and not the phone.  This is one of the problems with buying an integrated charger/cable unit... when the cable connector goes bad the charger becomes useless.  And it does appear to be a genuine Motorola product.
2	It's supposed to be &#34;rapid rate&#34; charger but it charges really slowly like most car chargers. It works so that's good enough for me. I also really liked the way the circle lit up blue when plugged in.
0	This worked for awhile maybe 3 months.  Then it stopped.  What kind of review do you give something that works well for three months but then stops working?  How about one star?
2	It started to get loose but it works well to charge my samsung phone and is handy to have in the car
0	My charger came in bulk packaging.  I've always been leery of chargers that come this way.  It's a big risk plugging my S3 into a device that could potentially be a knock off.  But here's my beef the bulk packing was not stated anywhere in the description.  What if this was to be a gift?  I purchased the charger directly from the Amazon store so there's really no excuse for this.
2	Even though it was an OE charger I don't know if it was a charger or a Droid X problem but the phone sometimes would not charge on this even though the light was on.  It was independent of which car I was in whether it worked or not.  I got rid of the Droid X and got a new Moto X and use the new charger that came with it and don't have any problems with it.
2	I have a Samsung galaxy 2 Skyrocket and was looking for a rapid charger since the one I had quit working. I knew this was the same micro-USB power Adapter as my Samsung but everytime I plug this in my phone it seems to open up the accuweather app and plus I have my digital clock on my lock screen set to display on top and it puts it on the bottom of my lock screen. In order to put it back on top I have to turn off the phone and thats what this charger doesn't do. It automatically reboots it instead of turning it off completely. I know that's not a bad thing but I like it to turn off completely. The only cool thing is the blue Motorola emblem lights up in the middle to indicate it's on. Gonna try to find my old charger and buy that when I find it. I'm assuming that the electronics in this charger is geared toward Motorola only.
0	Does not last long! All of a sudden stops charging. This is the second one I have bought thinking it was a fluke with the first. Not recommended unfortunately.
0	If i could give this 0 stars i would. This item arrived in a plastic sandwich bag. It did not charge my phone. Sent it back. Bought a verizon charger that works great. Would not recommend this item.
0	I ordered two and the first two did not work at all I got two more and of these one was only spotty at best and the other got super hot when it was plugged in. I have in and went to the the Verision store and bought one that actually works.
2	I purchased this item a little over a year ago.  The price point is great for a branded vehicle charger.  The styling is interesting and futuristic.  It did seem to charge faster than other auto chargers I have used.  One minor issue is that the blue lighting produced by the charger is somewhat distracting while driving at night. It is bright and can produce glare in the driver's peripheral vision.  This is easily solved by either placing tape over the light source or just turning it sideways.  The charger worked great hooked up to my Droid X auto mount for over a year but recently started working only part of the time and needs to be jiggled to get it to work.  You hope when you buy name brand over generic that you're going to get a little better build quality but at this price I'm just viewing it as a lease and just purchased a replacement.  I'll try to treat the new one a little more delicately.
2	Does an adequate job. The cord is long and the charger works however for the LG G2 it will advise that it is not a reccomended charger and the charge will be slow. I suspect that this will be similar to other new android phones.
0	This one died in 3 weeks using it with my new Samsung Nexus!!! Wow expected it to last longer... Little upset...
0	Now after not four months its trash does not charge any longer.  I contacted seller and they said sorry you had a 30 day window to send back. Ever hear of a 30 day warranty? Garbage. Guess you get what you pay for.
2	But then after less than 6 months the charger died. Not sure why because the charging light would be on but it wouldn't charge any of the devices I tried to plug in that previously had worked. When the charger was working it worked well and charges were fast.
2	This charger is decent. It works which is what's important. But some of the features are fairly annoying which most people can accept given the low price of the unit and the convenience of a coiled wire.First off the unit is large. the plug head is massive and unsightly. It's basically sticking an advertisement for Motorola into your car who wants that?Second the price you pay you can easily afford a dual-usb socket which while meaning you'd have to provide your own USB cables means you can charge two items at once and it's not in your way as those sockets are relatively tiny.Third the item emits a blue light that illuminates the center plastic piece. This is unnecessary to me and is actually an eyesore as the blue can be distracting while you drive at night.
2	I needed new chargers for our vehicles as the existing ones broke from use.  I bought two kinds and this was by far the flimsier of the two.  It works fine.  I just do not know how long it will last.  I may have the same problem with this one as the last if the cable breaks away from the plug.  I do like the round grip for inserting and removing the charger from the power source.  That way we don't pull on the cable.
0	I ordered several of these at the same time and they have all had the same fate. The micro usb plug at the end fails prematurely and the blue Motorola light on the end of the adapter is obnoxiously bright. I was so bothered by the light on the adapter that I painted it black but then the usb plug broke again just a few weeks later. I'm throwing it away and looking elsewhere.
0	No excuse for this. It worked for about 9 months and its like many things where the hassle to replace is less than return.
2	I have gone through three of them1 I ran over... 2 the plastic that holds it in the outlet got worn down from use and now the 3rd one it makes a connection but a slight bump might knock it loose and stop charging the phone
2	I've had 2 of these they work for a few months then they gradually stop working. Plus the blue light is kind of cool at first but when you're driving at night it's too bright and distracting.
0	This is a cheap knock off.  Don't buy it.  I was expecting one like the one that came with my phone.The picture is inaccurate.
2	Worked for 1 yr ... then the micro usb connection wore out and became loose.The wearing out of the micro USB connection appears to be very common among cable manufactures.The price is so low though that I did purchase another one just now.If the connection is loose I will return it.And yes ... I ordered the one from Amazon.
2	I bought this to replace an older charger.  This thing barely provides a one to one charge.  If my phone is plugged into it and I'm using it it loses power.  If I'm not using it it barely adds one percent power per 15 minutes.  Looks good that's about it.
2	ORIGINAL REVIEW:What can I say about this one - it does the job  delivers a steady and consistent amount of power to recharge my Motorola RAZR phone and appears to be better-constructed and more durable than the non-OEM chargers for sale here on Amazon and elsewhere.  I've gone through a couple of off-brand chargers that seemed to break after a year of use that cost a few bucks more than this one.  If you are looking for a good charger for your Motorola-branded phone or anything else that charges via a micro-usb like my Kindle Fire I would recommend this one.3/18/14 Update:The above review was written after using the charger for about two weeks.  After a longer period of time while my comments on the durability / construction of the charger remain valid the power output is pretty minimal and I am changing my rating from a 4 star to a 3 star: charging my Motorola phone takes a heck of a long time if the power level is less than 50% and for example when it isdown to 20% and plugged in during a two-hour drive it consistently never gets above 50% charged.
0	This product does NOT fit any Motorola phone. It is not made for any that are flip phones. It can only be used in the newer style.
0	I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but this won't charge my Droid Incredible.  I took a five hour drive but when I unplugged the phone the battery was completely discharged and the phone was very hot to the touch.
2	These work great  when they work. Mine never went bad  but I left it plugged in all the time. My girlfriend however had gone through 2 in 6 months. She unplugs hers daily.  They do not withstand much movement.
0	This isnt a micro usb chager it is a regular usb charger and they send a cheap adapter for a micro usb port that falls off and is really long waste of money it says nextel on it instead of Motorola dont buy!
2	The plug on this particular charger is very flimsy. It will break if you bend it or plug in the phone and pull on the phone too hard. I bought two one still works.
2	ok for charging your micro device with this but I changed to a double connector since I had to charge more devices
0	Worked great at first- charged my Droid Bionic quickly without any issues. After a period of time (6 months or so)  the cord starts bending at a weird angle and will not charge the phone unless you hold it perfectly still (almost impossible in a moving car). I have 2 of the same exact chargers and both suffered from the same defect. Would rather pay more for a higher quality one than to have to replace it every 6 months.
2	This was a good charger. Kinda bulky and the blue light got annoying. But hey it works and it was cheap.
2	I'm disappointed as the title said rapid charger and its definitely not that. I use my Samsung Galaxy S III in the car for navigation (duh). I was hoping keeping it plugged to this charger will at the very least MAINTAIN the level of charge that I had when I got into the car even if not charge it up fully as I drive. No such luck. My charge kept going down. I had to switch the screen off so the charger could charge the phone up  a bit so it wouldn't go completely dead.
2	Bought this to charge my Samsung Galaxy s3 in the car and it worked for a few months then quit working. I've had better and worse.
2	So the charge part of this charger works just swimmingly. The cord is very springy though and loves to coil back on itself; this is fine for storage but when driving and having it plugged into a phone doing navigation having the cord pull so taut on itself sometimes makes the device askew or at worst pull the whole thing down. YMMV given where your device is in the car when charging and where the power outlet in the car is.
2	This functioned well for a year. After that the connector was wobbly in my phone and didn't charge consistently. It's cheap enough that only lasting a year isn't awful.However the blue light on the Motorola logo is so freakishly bright that I had to cover it with electrical tape. At night.. it is blinding. Not a good thing for a car charger.
2	Has lasted 3 years good product never given me trouble. With it came in different color LED'sHas been lectin the car well below zero and never had any problems. solid little chargerUpdate: Just died on me. i tore it apart (hoping to just replace a fuse) but does not appear to be anything wrong loose or blown. It lasted a little over 3 years. so for under $10 not a bad product.
2	+ Fast light- blue light was a bit too bright- lasted less than a year with daily use when using it with landscape mode galaxy note. This slight bending caused it to short out. Not a repeat for me. Going with a charger now that I can replace the cable on if I want to.
0	does not work with new smartphones.  my smartphone said when i plugged it in that this doesnt work with it and its would be slow to charge. do not get for modern smartphones.
2	Nothing great nothing bad just a charger that does what it was supposed to do and seems to fit well and charge quickly.
2	I purchased this based on the high review ratings on Amazon.  I don't like this charger.  it charges way too slow to the point that I cannot run my phones GPS on it and keep the current charge so how can it possibly charge the phone when the phone is in use?  I actually lost battery life while running the phone GPS with the charger plugged in.  Bottom line is that this charger doesn't have enough voltage to charge the phone.  I never had a problem with my previous charger that broke after 2 years.  I tried charging my phone on the way to church (a 30 minute drive)without any apps running and it only increased the battery life by 5%.  for the record I have a Motorola Photon 4g.  I have since purchased the New Trent Arcadia RapiduoNew Trent Arcadia Rapiduo (1PC) 10W 5V/2A Dual Port high-speed USB car charger w/ Free Full Speed Micro-USB Charging Cable (IMP80C)from Amazon because that charger is supposed to charge at higher speed.  I will write a review on that after trying it a few times.
0	They stopped working after exactly 9 months.  I bought them because of the good reviews.  Very Disappointed in the quality of this product.
2	It worked for a while... about a year and then it died. That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5.
2	The charger can out-charge a phone that is in heavy use (GPS streaming music etc) but barely. Works for me during long (and I mean long) road trips it will charge your phone. But for the most part it's enough to keep your phone alive. (And that's mostly what I use it for.)
2	I don't know much about amps etc.  This item seems to work well on my Motorola Razr Maxx (because of the battery in the Maxx I am not that dependent on a car charger anymore. Yaay!!!)  But I wish the cord was longer.  I find that the pull of the cord (because it is short) makes it harder to talk while the phone is connected to the cord.  It is also too short when trying to use the vehicle phone dock.  I would rather deal with a bit of extra cord (say a 6ft. length) than have to tussle with a short cord.
2	I'm a little disappointed that this doesn't charge my phone that fast considering it being a &#34;Rapid Rate Charger&#34;.  My original phone charger is faster.  My drive to work is 45 mins if my phone has 50% battery by the time i get to work it only charges up to 70% when other chargers I've had charges up to 100%.
0	This charger did not work right out of package it was a gift.  The price was great.  Just found out they couldn't use it so I took back to try to return.  Amazon said it is past return for full refund.Otherwise I am very happy with Amazon.
2	I bought this while ago to use my bluetooth music screaming and the fm trasimitter on my Lexus. All that worked pretty good but one using it to acutally make a call it wasnt so hot for the person I was talking to.
0	I found this headset very comfortable with excellent audio quality the few times it successfully connected to my Nokia phones.After working with BlueAnt tech support and trying it on two different phones they admitted that they have a known issue with Symbian OS phones (most Nokia and some other smartphones) where the headset can be paired with the phone but it does not connect reliably for incoming or outgoing calls. Phrases used by the tech included:[We] haven't got around the compatibility issues with Symbian phones.[this is a] known issue.and apparently there is a significant amount of discussion on the BlueAnt support boards (which he could not find during our call).NOT RECOMMENDED FOR SYMBIAN OWNERS as much as I would like to!
2	I have mixed feelings about this headset.First the bad news: It can't handle any wind at all even the slightest breeze kills the conversation.  Doesn't matter what setting I use it's just awful.  Secondly it keeps dropping out of Bluetooth  out of nowhere I get the descending tones that mean it's turning off then it dies.  Afterwards I restart it and it's fine.  The speaker volume for the headset is pathetically low at it's highest setting: If you're hard of hearing you won't be happy with this.On the good side it cancels out background noise wonderfully.  I've used it when I've been in a noisy car and while standing next to a noisy construction site and people could hear me just fine.I'm going to contact Blue Ant and see if they have any fixes for the problems and I'll update this post after that.
0	The unit came and right out of the box it had a rattling noise inside. I would've kept it but was bothering me when driving and I need to turn my head left and right.Also I noticed that it didn't work pretty good while paired with two mobile phones simultaneously.It is pretty small and it feels extremely comfortable I wish it would've worked properly.
2	THOUGHT I NEED' THESEBUT IT TURNED OUT I DON'TBUT IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THEM JUST IN CASE I DO NEED THEM ONE DAY.
2	These are not heavy duty straps but something you could use for keys or something light. I would recommend replacing the circular metal ring as the metal just barely overlaps. I would definitely not use these for a cell phone or anything with any weight or value. From the metal to the end of the strap is about 1 7/8 &#34; long. They come from China so they took a LONG time to get here.
2	I bought this product to tether my lifeproof to me in the wave pool. I used it along with a lanyard to keep my phone on me the entire day. The quality is &#34;Good&#34; however I have seen better ones in the past. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to tether anything with the ability to add a strap to it to anything else. This would also be useful for creating custom phone &#34;Jewels&#34;  (Those silly little things people attach to their phones just for looks)
2	Although it's hard to tell from the fuzzy closeup these DO NOT have split rings but bent rings.  IMO bent rings are in no way strong enough for a cell phone camera or mp3 player. A good example of split rings: [...]I will attempt to salvage these straps by adding real split rings. Good thing I have a magnifying lamp.
2	You can't beat the price.These are much smaller than I was expecting.  But still do the job.If you are looking for a bigger thicker cord...don't get these.  The cords are very thin and they are quite short.  But if that is what you are looking for then these are for you.
0	It appears in the photo that these might be sturdy items to keep your flash/thumb drives in one handy place. Nothing's further from the truth. The &#34;thread&#34; is not much thicker than what you'd use to sew buttons with and the ring that you are led to believe will hold several items is barely 1/3&#34; in diameter. Furthermore if you actually put a thumb drive on the ring you'd need a pair of needle nose pliers to spread the ring apart then forcefully close it back together. Yes they are cheap and yes there are several in the pack. But at over $8.00 in shipping (they come from Singapore) you can probably fashion a better thumb drive holder by using parts of old key chains. This is by far the worst purchase I've ever experienced on Amazon...who should be ashamed of themselves for selling such trashy junk.The jokes on me...I fell for the hype. Don't let that happen to you.
2	These go along with the Dust Proof Dust Plugs.These came in handy for my kids they are not too thin and none of them as broken yet.I got them for my kids DSis ipods and phones.
0	First of all I paid 78 cents for 10 of these. Shipping and all! I would NEVER trust them to hold the weight of my cell phone. The string is about as thick as fishing line. The ring is about 1/4 inch in diameter. The loop is only big enough to put three fingers thru them. This was a bad investment but for 78 cents I can't complain too much. I just CANNOT recommend them nor will I ever use them. There are far better lanyards out there and for not much extra money. DON'T BUY THESE!!
0	I chose this rating because the product never came.  I dislike that they were no help in getting me this product.  I recommend that no one else buy from this person because you will receive no item.  It's hard to rate the quality of something that does not exist. :(
2	They shipped from China and took forever to get here. They're not easy to put into use without distorting the clasp a bit. They come in a 10 pack so pay attention because I didn't and order 30 instead of the 3 I thought I was purchasing. Oh well guess i have a life times supply.
2	i travel a lot and carry too many chargers...so i though the callpod was a great idea.i ordered the charger and 4 adapters for $109 bucks...  the deliver was ontime.what arrived was a really cheap plastic pod and adapters that at most should not cost more than $2 bucks each...  the adapters are so cheaply made that they don't attach to the pod very good.  the charger has all these lights that stay on unless i unplug the entire unit.  the ipod charger is so badly made that it got stuck in my ipod...i had to spend serveral minutes trying to jiggle it out...i believe the side buttons which actuate the clip in inop...i called cellpod and they said to send it back...  i said no...they sent a defective adapter and they should pay the postage...  then...they tried to convince me to go to dhl and use their account...  i said no...i paid for deliver to my house and i'm not running around town looking for dhl...  finally...after haggling with c/s they said they would send a prepaid dhl envelope to my home...all in all...this is really a cheesy product and not very good customer service...  i have not received the dhl envelope after a week...i will never buy from them again...nor will i recommend their products to my fellow travellers...
2	works alright but you cant wear it continuously for long durations. I love my music but the way it sits around your head after wearing for for some time its start to hurt. But may be its just me and I do have a big head.
2	I use these for everyday use around the house or office and generally when traveling or mowing the lawn. They have been fantastic for 11 months until I began to wear them while exercising 3 weeks ago and found that despite their claim of being moisture and sweat resistant they don't appear the be able to handle sweat much at all. My head and neck get damp during exercise (not dripping) and it somehow seeped into the controls and the vol down and rewind buttons stopped working. Also while exercising the headphones initiated a phone call on my cell phone (there is a button on them for that).Before this problem they were fantastic. Bottom line wearing them while working out probably isn't a good idea but for everyday use they are champs They take a lot of abuse and keep on going but they seem deathly afraid of sweat :)
2	After owning these for two weeks I can say that they work almost as described.  I carry my phone in my front pants pocket and the Bluetooth rarely cuts out while listening to MP3's.  I have an average size head and my ears start to hurt after about a half hour of listening with the stock rubber ear cushions. I have installed the included optional rubber cushions and it is better but after an hour and a half it still starts to hurt. The back of the unit rests on my collar and the rubbing of the collar against the headphones transmits into the ears.The music is crisp and clear but weak bass.  I turned up the base on my Razr V3xx but it does not matter because the speakers do not play any bass.  It works great as a headset pairs up with the phone instantly and answers calls automatically.  People hear me clearly on the other end. It charges with the phone charger or through a USB port.  Everything is okay except ... weak BASS.Addendum: I found out that if I remove my eye-glasses the base improves.  I guess the glasses keep the headset from forming a good seal.I would now give these 4 stars.
0	I hate the fact I wasted money on this product. After 2 days I had 1 hour of battery life. I had to keep it on charger just to have juice for maybe 1 conversation its not comfortable and its flimsy. Dont waste your money.
2	Less high frequency response than my Motorola S9's.Difficult pairing with HTC Touch -- have to go to settings - each time to refresh unit as Wireless stereo and wireless handset.  A pain !Fits well.  Light - great for exercising.  Don't get in the way.
2	I went through two of these.  They are great.  However considering I had to go through 2 of them in the past 3 months I would say the build quality is garbage... at least in the plastic near the speaker.  That plastic will just snap with normal use.  I've never had this problem with any other headphone.  It does sound great though.
0	I had read about this same problem in a review before I bought these but I thought it was just a fluke. I had mine for a little over a month and the plastic that holds the right speaker on broke rendering the headset useless. It looks like I can return them and I would replace with another but I don't want to keep replacing them because of a design flaw.Sound quality WAS great for music. These are good if you want music headset that you can answer a phone call if you have to. But if you intend on talking on the phone with much any back ground noise this might not be the one.
2	Its Fine but The secondary little side flap that gives a place to store cash or cards is a Joke.I see little picture like windows?! Only a (1) Postage stamp could fit in them and don't think about removing it once it is in.The Card slot is not going to really hold but one card and you will not want to keep it there once you see it there.And you almost have to RIP the flap open (Good snaps) But not the Magnet snap. I find myself always TRYINGto set it (the magnet snap) in it's little click/closed hole.Great Price though so I have it till I can find one like I used to have.
2	it looks better than it actually is. not going to use this for cards or anything like they showas it won't close correctly then and if so very flimsy not safe
2	The phone part worked okay but the wallet part for your license or credit cards really was a little small things did not fit well in this area.
2	I got this for my father who always forgets his wallet but not his phone. But it seems like he will keep forgetting his wallet. This case only holds his phone. if you close it it close but seems like it wont close for long. because its about to bust. but it seems to be holding. oh and if you have a case cover on your phone it will get stuck inside of here.
2	I am not happy with the quality of the product and chip looking material; however it fits the price.  I wish it was a little bigger too so the phone could easily comes out specially when using the protector cover. Also I could not easily turn off the phone when can not answer. It is not easy to use the clip on belt or purse too tight; however I like the two sim-card keeper slot for international traveling use.
0	Not worth spending money on this guy ! Not worth spending time on this guy either !Not worth spending money on this guy ! Not worth spending time on this guy either !
2	Does the job.Nice quality cable.Should be shorter like 3 feet instead of 6 feet. I had to coil up all the excess.If you want to use it in a car it is too long and you will have to coil up the excess.
2	This cord is ok to charge a ipod not an iphone will be to scnog to power it up.
2	it is ok but gives us a hard time to charge and sometimes it will not charge the nano or the iphone
0	Iphone is a complete rip off and most people I know that have one don't even know why they got it oter than being able to say hey I got an Iphone.  The thing is a IPOD touch with very basic phone functions.....more over priced garbage from crapple made to rake in apple fanboys money.....and they fall for it.
2	its great for the price but if your looking for a durable one nah this isnt the one for youyou can scratch the screen protector with your nails!!!! this is how easy to scratch itother than that its whatever
0	I got this sim card as a free promo item with the purchase of a cell phone the rates for this service are really nuts I probably won't use it.
0	I've always just bought an international phone card when I've traveled but decided to take my own phone this one time and try one of these sim cards. Well let me tell you. I made about 45 minuets of calls during a total of 3 weeks and my overall bill was $176. So if you do the math I could have spend about $13 American dollars on a 10 euro calling card with 400 minuets and called from the hotel or any public phone....or $176 for less than an hour of calls. This was certainly the worse choice I made for my trip and I advise you to NOT buy this! Amazon.com please consider taking this off your list of products...it is very misleading and cost consumers way too much money after it is purchased.
0	Read the other reviews carefully. Those ranking it high may not be well-informed about all options -and there ARE comparatively INEXPENSIVE easily available options!You'll need an unlocked quad-band phone (available in all price ranges - sometimes buying one at destination can be competitive re price but not always) plus your own regular service SIM pre-authorized for international use (call your carrier before you go) to use just in case until you decide which service to use wherever you're headed. Even at a dollar or two per min for a just in case call YOUR OWN service will for those few calls until you get a local SIM be cheaper. (Or you can always text-message/SMS cheaper YET even on your own SIM!) Also pack a good pre-paid international phone card too as back-up (amt depending how long you'll be gone and how many countries you're jaunting off to - you can recharge this too) so you can call home from something other than your cell (which can also get pricy).On arrival purchase a local-provider SIM w/appropriate features for you  (kiosks local cell ph provider stores) and add some initial funds to it. Install or ask them to do so. Then buy pre-paid recharge cards as needed; not high-priced. I found them even in E Europe (every country) and Turkey - yes higher per min than a contract but a TINY percentage of the cost of Mobal or your own cell ph! Take a few minutes on-line and explore regarding this - you will be very glad you did.I hope Amazon withdraws this from their offerings I truly do.
0	It's convenient but the charges are astronomical. Even if you only use it for a handful of minutes you'd be better off purchasing a prepaid card in whatever country you have traveled to. Be warned Mobal is a ripoff.
0	I chose this card even though it had mediocre reviews because it was the only one I could find that charged by use not a prepaid amount.  I went to europe and never used the card/phone and was charged for 3 text messages that I never got.  For $2.40 I didn't fight the error very hard but the fact remains I was charged for services not rendered.  Further they were were after me for the $2.40 before I even got back from the 8 day trip.  (emails when I got home were already in my inbox)  Its not the money its the principle I don't like disingenuous companies.  For a lousy $2.40 they should have just said sorry and written it off.  I would have used the card on future trips but its in the trash now.
0	I bought this item after i forgot to add it to my unlocked phone purchase and it was a waste because you cannot use this sim without giving your credit card which means that even if you only want incoming calls you still need to register. The plan and pricing are not clear.Also the phone number is in the UK and i was expecting it to be in the US.
0	I bought the card and took it on an international trip.  I put the card into my phoneand went to the site to activate it and it said to put in 19-20 numbers but therewere about 30 numbers and letters on the sim card.  It was worthless.
0	I charged up the battery and use my phone for just under one hour.  The next morning I wanted to place a call and the charge didn't hold.  I replaced with the older battery and it has worked very well.  I will not order from OEM again.
2	The power retention of this battery is half as much as the original battery.  Many of the replacement batteries do not measure up to the performance of the original batteries.
2	This battery was purchased for my Motorola RIZR Z3. I believe the battery is a Motorola battery but certainly not brand new. It doesn't keep a charge nearly as long as the original battery when the phone was 1st purchased. I suspect this battery is probably refurbished or was defective when made and didn't pass the new battery test and that's the reason it's being sold at a knock-off price. However definitely does not work like a new battery.
2	lasted only 3-4 months when the original lasted over a year.  You cannot determine if they are from the manufacturers or black market.
2	I bought this item for my sister because she had an E63 Nokia that was only shutting off on her so she thought it was the battery causing the problem. The item came on time and in working and good condition i had no problem with the battery what so ever the only problem was that my sister's E63 Nokia problem was more than the battery.
2	This product has all the signs of a genuine Nokia battery but after the first week it seemed to always lose its charge and get extremely warm during moderate usage.  My previous Nokia E71 battery lasted nearly three years and just got weak.  This one seems weak AND gets VERY warm to the touch.  I haven't checked but I suspect its voltage output is low and causes a higher amperage draw.
2	I suspect this battery is not new. If it is then it's defective. I'd bet this was a refurbished battery. This battery best performance equaled the performance of my original battery after I had it about a year. At best it performed OK but nothing like a new battery. BTW - I purchased this battery in Aug 2011 I'm again looking to purchase it's replacement because one again I find myself having to charge it on average twice per day.I will say I received the battery quickly. Kudos to the seller for that.
2	I have used it but had to get a USB cable to fit it like the idea of charging the phone and another battery at the same time.
2	I didnt realize it did not come with a cord! That would be my own fault for not reading correctly. Although I have read that the indicator light is suppose to go from Yellow to Green? Well i have 2 batterys both went in dead and the entire time it was Green.. The batterys charged.. although I dont know how long to keep them in? I'm not sure. Although it works. So i cant really complain much.
2	it works well with the phone the clip to hold onto the ear is not aero dynamic and the ear bud does fit well into the ear canal
2	The Good: The headset pairs well with the iPhone 3G and 3G S.  The controls on the headset work very well (A2DP with AVRCP).  For music I could play pause fast forward and rewind easily (great for listening to audio books).  For talking you can answer calls from the headset without having to press anything on the phone.  The stereo sound is great when you plug in the second earpiece.  The in-ear Noise Isolation ear-buds are comfortable and work well.The Bad: The noise reduction cuts off outgoing speech so people were constantly asking me to repeat what I said.  This was the deal-breaker for me because I am always talking on the headset.  If Plantronics could fix this the headset would be perfect!
2	Not a bad headset not the best but works pretty well. You should really buy this for a store thou bought one bluetooth from here an when I received it the thing wouldn't charge. I tried everything didn't work I might lose money from buying this online.
2	I was pretty disappointed in this. First it's not very sturdy and didn't last very long before it was broken after being held in my pocket when I'd go out. It didn't really matter though because I didn't miss it; the audio and A2DP quality were both pretty disappointing so I just got a new better one and didn't feel too bad about it.
2	I got this for 31 dollars once.  I dont know why it went down so much.  The one I got might have not been compatible with my phone( which was an LG Env2)  But this works well otherwise that is until im using it!  It frequently disconnects during calls while on the phone for 15 minutes( sometimes it happens almost right away.  No matter how close I am to the phone ( which doesnt make sense because its fullly charged and supposed to last at least 5 hrs) I mean the no matter how good anything else is( soundmic etc product buildfeatures) it all depends on how stable its connectivity is to the phone!  I know alot of others gave good reviews on this but after reading about what many others have to say about the way this disconnects alot I dont doubt it.  Ive had other bluetooth headsets and none of them ever had this problem.  The volume doesnt get that high for music and the sound can be a little tinny at times.  I will be looking elsewhere for bluetooth headsets.Gotta have one that stays connected. Thats a must.
0	I have another Plantronics Blue tooth headset for calls. It works fine.I mainly ordered this after reading the reviews for my iPhone to do both - answer calls and listen to an acceptable level of bluetooth music.a) The bluetooth music is BAD. Sound is tinnyb) I use this while walking (not running just walking). The music skips for every step I takec) The stereo headset uses a proprietary connector so you can't use any other earphonesd) the connector doubles as an earloop. Although they give you other earloops for changing out that only works for the mono earbud. If you use the stereo headphone you are stuck with this single earloop.e) Comes with so-called usb charger but the usb connector is proprietary non standard. This means you cannot use any of the zillions of standard usb cables/connectors you(i) have lying aroundI would have returned this immediately except that only non-opened items can be returned.Choose some other product this one certainly does not work
0	Worked great with iphone3 and NZ-409 but does not work with iphone4... No updates available so useless...Moving to NZ-500 unit with built in bluetooth and iphone4 certification....
2	It was probably right there in the manual all along...this thing is about the equivalent of a bluetooth earpiece except that it stops the music...if you have a friend that has a stereo that imports the contact list dials from the screen etc. They do not have a NX409 or NZ409...the screen doesn't even know the phone is there until a call comes through. Don't even think about the possibility of putting your phone away and seeing the name come up on the screen.Not really sure that $78 + installation + where do I put the wired microphone = worth not having to wear an earpiece.Bluetooth music? I guess that could be useful if Pandora worked better on my phone but it is much easier just to stick your mp3s on a usb stick or ipod.I'm about ready to put it on Craigslist and take my loss now. :(
2	I have this hooked up to a clarion head unit so no issues with compatibility however for the price I don't get this item at all- it's voice quality is terrible the controls haven't worked for any phone or mp3 player I've tried and the interface is both unintuitive and intrusive all at the same time.The unit uses BOTH of your RCA auxillary inputs plus a 12v switched source. It's easy to hook up but you'll need an adapter if your headunit doesn't have free RCA inputs. There's no provision for bridging or adding to an existing RCA input device. The cord provided seems to be long enough but when you actually get to threading it around the dash bits of your car it's not long enough to reach up into the roof lining or sun visors where the mic could adequately pick up your voice. The mic is horrible- the noise suppression basically doesn't work and you'll sound like you're in a tin can regardless of how loud you turn this up. Fortunately on the output side the unit works well and includes a switch which lets you route signal to your left or right car speakers. It doesn't seem to have a provision to route it to both so you're likely to have to turn up your stereo quite loud to hear the other person.The controls don't work for my android phone or my wifes nor with my daughter's nokia so don't think you'll be able to answer or hang up with the interface on the mic unit. It also doesn't seem to control any digital music players we've tried. The unit only works for one bluetooth device at a time so if it's hooked up to a passenger's phone or computer you won't be able to use it for your phone. Also it has to be paired whenever you switch bluetooth devices; it doesn't seem to remember units it's paired with previously.The head unit has an incredibly bright blue led that's so obnoxious I've had to face the unit against the headliner to prevent it from being distracting at night. The led will literally light up the inside of your car; it's that bright and blinking. You can't turn it off or change the color- it just blinks and annoys.So for this rather amazingly high price you get a unit which doesn't work very well at it's basic tasks (picking up speech playing music or letting you listen to callers) and doesn't have any special features- like multiple pairing memory or a connection which allows you to have other auxillary devices on your headunit. Basically- I see it as a bust. I have it and I use it but I wouldn't buy another one and I'll tend to steer clear of any clarion headunit which needs to use this thing.
2	The Plantronics Explorer 220 Bluetooth headset is cheap light and easy to pair with a cell phone.  That's about it.Unfortunately there are a lot more negative things with this unit that keeps me from recommending it.-the transmission is weak (sometimes the person on the other line cannot hear me and vice versa)-often times drops the bluetooth connection-there are unwanted noise (humming clicking etc.) through the earpiece-the ear hook hurts my ear no matter which side I use it-sometimes it accidentally turns on when in my pocket (when the button gets slightly pressed it turns on) and I run out of battery juice in the middle of a callI've gone through three of these units from three different sources and they all have the same problems.  So it is not an issue of just getting a bad item at one time.Overall I cannot recommend it.  I gave it two stars because I do not usually talk on the phone for more than a minute at a time and this is sufficient half of the time.I've resorted to an older bluetooth headset theMotorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset (Color Sent Based on Availability. Comes in Black Blue and Grey or Silver)[Bulk Packaged].  I know when it is on/off when the microphone boom is out/in.  The soft rubber ear hook is gentler to my sensitive ear and I've never had a problem with poor signal or dropped connections.
2	I went through three wired headsets (I like earbuds for wearing with ski and bike helmets) - lost one and had two fall apart on me so I went to this product.  But I am not impressed with this product - I can't get the earpiece to stay in my ear except by twisting the ear loop and jamming the ear bud into my ear - it HURTS after just a few minutes of my 30 minute commute or if it isn't hurting me it falls off and hits the ground or gets lost under my car seat.  The volume doesn't go high enough while I'm driving so I can't hear over the car noise (yes I have a brand new fairly quiet car)  Anyway I'm debating returning it due to the discomfort factor.
2	This is my third bluetooth voice device and I have to say that I've yet to experience a product that worked as advertised.Forget the claims companies make about reception distance.  The 220 is no exception.  On my Blackberry I've found that anything over 5 to 7 feet creates far too much annoying static.  Unlike the other bluetooth devices I've used I've actually encountered static with the 220 even when I'm 1 foot from the phone.  However I will say this - this is the most stable device I've used so far.  Once it partners with the phone it remains connected.So it's been a mixed bag.  I'll use the 220 until it breaks or is lost (and that always seems to happen).  After that I certainly won't be looking to buy another of the same model.
2	I really hated having cords all over in my car. Got this and it work but the port is a bit loose when connected. As long as I do not bump my phone it will charge and works great. Just wish the connection was a bit better.
0	I know there is always a risk when buying generic cheap made in China stuff like this but Ive actually had pretty good luck with other cheap car charges like this.  For the price I figured Id buy a couple of spares in case one died.I ordered 3 of these and while the retracting mechanism seems to work very well two of the three simply did not work.  I tried it in two different cars on two different phones.  In both cases the red LED lit up so it cant be a fuse issue but neither phones indicated that it was receiving a charge when these chargers were connected.The third one does work but only intermittently.  If I connect it and leave the cord fully retracted it does not charge.  However if I pull out the cord almost all of the way it seems to make the connection and charge the phone.I know I could probably return these but for how cheap they are its not worth the hassle to package them up and pay for return shipping.
0	I purchased a bunch of these since my Girlfriend tends to destroy them on a regular basis regardless of the build quality.  I had bought similar chargers before that did OK. These ones however didn't work even right out of the packaging or stopped working after a few uses.  I only have one left that works about half the time.
0	The micro USB side of the cable could never establish a reliable connection with any device I attached it to and this past week it stopped working all together. I've owned this item for well under a year; way too soon for a cable to stop working.I advise looking at a different company.
2	I bought this phone in March 2008 like many other reviewers who wanted a PDA and phone combination. While it looks great and does have a slide out keyboard this phone has serious issues. I agree with many here it is slow as Hell. If you needed help or have an emergency your are out of luck. It takes forever to boot up. Of course leaving it on drains the battery big time. I had my phone synced to my computer and bought a few apps for it and this slowed it down even further. It got so bad I had to completely reset the device wiping out all my info. I stopped syncing it and had to ditch some apps I really liked because the Tilt had issues with them. The Internet looks horrible on this phone it is slow even with a 3G connection and I don't bother with the Wi-Fi. I won't play music on it. Call quality is also not great. I use a Jabra bluetooth which makes calls sound much better and clearer than the phone itself. The lag time for opening anything is far too long. It takes what seems like an eternity for the Windows Mobile system to open apps up. I had used Motorolas (hated those) Nokia (loved them) and this was the first HTC phone I have tried. It will be my last. I have an iPod Touch which I love and now want an iPhone. The Touch is easier to use than this. The Tilt is too overpiced for how it (does not) perform. While it has a lot of features getting to them and using them wastes time that you are supposed to be saving. If I had known then what I know now I would have never have bought this phone. It only gets 2 stars because of the screen keyboard and Office Mobile apps included. I was extremely disappointed in how this phone operates. If you are thinking of purchasing this phone DON'T Bother there are better phones out there.I am going to revise my review to note a few things about how this phone works. After having tried a new Nokia N96 and its annoying menus and buttons I actually found myself missing some features of the Tilt. The Tilt will allow you to directly access features by both screen touch and stylus. Connections to the Internet may be slow but it will use the best option available without bugging you. The Internet does not look as good as it does on an iPod Touch or an iPhone. The buttons on the face do light up and are easy to see quickly and the keyboard is helpful. Navigation is better than I orginally thought.  It is not enough to change my rating or suggest purchasing it unless you really want a PDA more than a phone. The Tilt does have strong PDA features but it does run under the Windows Mobile interface. Apple has it beat with the Touch and the iPhone.
0	first off the rating is 1-star only because i can't leave it at 0. i got this phone over the iphone because of the lack of MMS and QWERTY keypad on the iphone. boy that was a HUGE mistake. when i initially bought the phone i had it for only a week and a half when major bugs started showing up. the keypad text only shows up half of the time and it was taking literally 10 minutes to open programs. no joke. then it started freezing so badly that the only way to shut it off was to remove the battery. during this time frame i had not downloaded anything that could have disrupted the phone in any way. needless to say i returned this phone and got a replacement.the replacement phone was great...for a month and a half. that's when all the issues from the first phone started happening again. with this phone i refrained from downloading anything period. all i can say is that this phone sucks big-time.
0	This product merits a 1-star due to the fact that Amazon censors well-cited reviews that point out the deep flaws of this 'iPhone killer'.It's nice it has a faster cpu now but the fancy Qualcomm integration with ATI video hardware actually now PREVENTS the video acceleration from being used unlike the predecessors because either nobody can legally or be capable to (Qualcomm) implement drivers nor afford to (HTC).  It's like getting a nice fast Nvidia video card and then running the computer in Safe Mode.The phone can actually take decent pictures if you can get pass the sluggish skippy blurring display that reminisces of FIRST GEN digicams as well as the resolution reducing glare from the non-removable lens cover.Heat is an issue where the device can almost burn your hand when 3G and WiFi are both on although it's nice the display doesn't distort because of it and the battery doesn't explode.Windows Mobile as an OS isn't that great and still isn't that great on this hardware.  It multitasks TOO WELL so you can end up having sluggish response when running apps because something in the background starts chugging the CPU.  Then because its graphics APIs (such as DirectX Mobile) rely on hardware acceleration and there is NONE on this phone screen redraws are sandwich making time almost.Think of this more as a PDA that has phone features than as a phone with nice PIM features.  Compared to even Palm's extremely outdated OS the software OS on this phone runs like a sloth and lacks any of the polish Apple SHIPS with its phone.It is nice this phone does allow you to flash new ROMs to get past some of the limited features that ship with it (although no video acceleration fixes) and that it is a WORLD TRAVELER so you can take this phone and use from Japan to Europe to everywhere that uses WCDMA and GSM except for T-Mobile's/Emobile's 1700MHz 3G network.Unlike what Ace Wireless of Gardena will tell you WCDMA 3G allows you to do voice and data simultaneously.
2	I'll be quick.  Good idea here poor engineering.  When it works it's wonderful but it hits snags way too often.  I upgraded software as per customer service it didn't help much.GPS is great when it works but too often fails.Bluetooth stereo is great when it works but too often it fails and devices have to be reset/repaired.I have to reboot an average of 4 times per week.One solid plus the cell signal has been outstanding for me.  I can get a connection and complete a call when my friends can't.If the next iPhone has GPS I will probably eBay my Tilt.
2	I've tweaked mine and added 3rd party programs but you can't get around the fact that it's pretty darn hard to make a simple phone call without the stylus and it's especially frustrating to use the keypad for call options (e.g. voice mail) once your call is connected.  This just plain sucks.Basic phone call operations turn into a two handed procedure pretty dangerous when you're on the road.After 5 months with this phone I'm really missing a phone that has a keypad.  I've gone back to my Nokia 73 and will continue shopping for a better Windows Mobile device...
0	I actually never used it but here is why.  When I finally got the package it was folded in half with tire marks all over it.  Like the mail man folded it laid in on the street backed up right on top of it and proceeded to power brake and burn out on top of it.  needless to say the screen had unfixable creases and was barely still in the wrapper.it might be a good protector and it really probably had absolutely nothing to do with the seller but I was pretty steamed.
2	I ordered this because the Microsoft one is super over-priced but in the end it just would have been better to get the Microsoft one. (or better yet use HDMI if that is an option) The overall build feels cheap and looks cheap but that doesn't always mean it is cheap this time however it did. It works I'll give it that and it even came with a nifty little adapter/extender for the Audio cable but the image is in triplicate the main image in the middle then a ghosted image on both sides. It isn't so bad that you couldn't play but it definitely gets annoying super fast. Just bite the bullet and get the Microsoft one or get a new monitor for Christmas that has HDMI input like I did.
2	This wire is very thin and feels cheap I't didn't work for what I was trying to do but it wasn't the wires fault I'm trying to get rid of the feedback noise from my comp to my converter box to my tv this worked the same if not a little worse than the one I already have built into my VGA cable.  I would recommend this for the price and the length just to get by but beware it is the one of the cheapest feeling wires you will ever see.  I thought it was twelve feet for how small it rolls up till I re read twenty five feet and I said wow.  I recommend if having any high end stuff to spend another five bucks and buy a lifetime wire instead of this one.  One benefit of this wire is it rolls up to a tiny hoop and would fit easily in a velcro case with your portable cd player.  Good for just getting by.Update: they sit in a closet so nothing new but I did think to ad that they are great for portability being so thin and I'm sure they work fine just didn't clear out the hum between my comp and my tv same as one I had built in my vga cable.  So anyway ez to through in a bookbag or nap sack and have that cable with you it takes up no room.
0	Bought this to connect my speakers to my TV.  Its ok I guess for $4.50 now you cannot expect much but I dont expect it to last.  The cord is really thin.  I have to make sure I use minimum bending radiuses or else I feel like I will snap it in half.I also seem to get some 60hz hum if I leave any of the extra cord laying around behind my TV. and the associated power cords.First cord got sucked up into the vacuum and is longer usable.  Ordered another and the metal connector just broke off.  Looking for a different item this time.
0	This looked like a great deal. I have a boombox with a 1/8&#34; (3.5 mm) input for external audio sources which I wanted to use for my tablet computer and a couple of other portable devices. All I got was distorted mono sound or stereo sound with a 60 cycle hum depending on how far in I pushed the plug. Pushing it all the way in only produced hum. Tried it on a number of devices. Same results. My guess is that the internal wires are not connected at the right spots in the plugs. I bought a shorter more expensive cable that works. Buyer beware.
2	If you buy it to plug your phone into the audio in your car...news flash read the length.  It's a bit over three yards.  Not under 3 feet which would probably suit the car purpose better.  It does work but it became cumbersome. Don't order things in a hurry people.  I learned that twice this year.
0	They worked ok for about an hour then starting making clicking noises and cutting in and out on my headphones. Must be a very shoddy product if it can't even work for a full day- I returned them.
2	I bought this cable 4 months back. I noticed few days back it is playing only one side of speakers. Not working for stereo. Only one side at a time. Even tough I used this cable very rarely for my Creative speakers.Now I will look for another cable.
2	Kept this in my car and it worked well for 2 or 3 uses then just stopped working. Replacement cable worked well so wasn't my car. Not happy with the quality of this product.
2	This is a great concept and everything is good about it compared to a wired headset except two things.First there is a very little bit of static or fizzing sound in the background of listening to music with it from my Smartphone. And second much less important to most except those like me it doesn't capture the ultra-low frequency bass sounds that I like to hear. It has very good low bass and overall range from highs to lows. Understand the difference between low range bass and ultra-low range bass.I don't know if the slight hissing sound was due to the Smartphone or the speakers of the headset but otherwise it's excellent.
2	I love SonyEricsson phones and products. I no longer own an SE phone and this is unfortunate as the HBH-980 would be awesome with any SE phone I'm sure. Unfortunately I cannot take full advantage of all the features of the HBH-980 with my current phone and laptop setup.+ PROS +* Decent Sound Quality (for cell phone and Windows music players [WinAmp WMP etc.])* Necklace style headphones.* Great for SonyEricsson Phones.* Looks cool.- CONS -* There is too much slack for the headphones it hangs to low (for me at least). This is true no matter how the length is adjusted.* The sounds cuts out constantly when using the set with my BlackBerry (BB) phone. (At least once per song)* The address book feature does not work with my BB.* The charger is inconvenient for me as I no longer have a SonyEricsson phone.* There is no 3.5mm input jack.* The range is poor at best ( at least in an environment with only moderate interference )* In Windows the next/prev buttons do not work for WinAMP. I'm sure there is a work around but it is just unfortunate that this functionality is not working from the get go. I'm not too fond of other music players...* In Ubuntu this device registers as a mono headset and the sound quality was horrid when listening to music with RhythmBox. This is another unfortunate discovery. Again I'm sure there is a work around (different drivers maybe) but it just sucks from the get go. The next/previous also did not work.Conclusion:I do not think this product is bad but it is definitely not what I personally am looking for in a headset. I can't iterate enough that this headset works best with SE phones and maybe Macs or Windows users using iTunes or some other player?This product would be almost 5 stars for sure if I still had my old phone.
2	It works ok with my BlackJack II and my MacBook. However here are few things to know:1. If the phone is locked you cannot control it with the headset. i.e. I can not skip track.2. It is hard switch the music device. I will fiddle with the headset to have the MacBook as the main music device.
0	This ear piece have a weak reception it don't filter out sounds very wellthis is a very poor product disappointed.
0	This bluetooth is NOT woth buying. It hurts your ear so bad that you will have to take it out often. The voice quality is NOT good and the person voice drops out often. The battery is also very bad. It does NOT last long at all even on a full charge. I will never buy another Motorola bluetooth again!
2	After months and months of searching for the perfect Bluetooth headset I felt my quest was finally over. After trying the top rated headsets (Jawbone 1 &2 Blueant z9(i)) I was sold completely on the VMX 100. After doing the research on this headset I ignored one key factor in almost every review I read.... I could hear the caller's great! However they heard an almost delayed robotic annoying voice from me. After calling tech support for the VMX 100 I was brushed off somewhat and not given a fix to the problem. By the way I tried this headset with multiple Smartphone (Treo Blackberry HTC etc. as well as with regular flip phone models). Everything I was looking for in a headset was great - the fit the look the price. The Jawbone(s) and Blueant(s) all failed due to the 'Ear bud' effect. I could never get those headsets to stay in my after no longer than 15 minutes without them either hurting my ear or just flat falling out. The technology is there for these headsets no robotic sound! Other that the fact this (VMX 100) headset failed at the voice delivery it's perfect. If Sennheiser fixed this problem I am sold!
2	I needed a new headset (my BlueAnt is so small and light I constantly lose it).  Sennheiser figured out easy-to-use answers to what are the biggest drawbacks of most headset designs: noise canceling switching the mic from side to side and the buttons (on/off call volume).  Kind of a DUH! simplistic design.  BUT:*  The outer plastics used in the construction are VERY CHEAP.  I pulled it out to use a couple weeks ago and found it shattered in pieces.  It hadn't been run over by the car or sat upon or dropped.  I've since made several attempts to SuperGlue it back together.*  Should the battery run down while in use it shuts me out of my call (LG phone).*  Sometimes the ready/in use light will go on but I am unable to get the earpiece to respond.>SIGH&lt;After trying many different makes and models over the years (Sennheiser BlueAnt Cardo Motorola Ericksson Jabra Plantronics) I'm sticking with Plantronics for all future purchases.  I had the Voyager 510 for years until I wore it out.  I'm set to buy another.  Plantronics to me is the gold standard in bluetooth technology.
2	I do not have a Galaxy Note I was just looking for a really large case. I have a work and person phone that I need to carry at all times so I was looking for something big enough to hold both. I found this and thought it looked great and it definitely did look it when I got it. However after a couple weeks I can tell its not.First I ordered this product and received it the next day thats impressive since its from a third party shipper not amazon.The the way its made didn't work well for me. There is so much velcro on the front its a bit crazy no case needs that much. I wound up removing the velcro from the front because it made too much noise and just wasn't doing anything. I left the small parts on the other side of the stitches which is plenty.Not after a couple weeks the fabric on the back is pulling away. If you look on the picture you can see the metal clip is on a peice of fabric which is then sewn onto the main part. That part is already separating. I dont expect this to last me more than 3 months tops.
2	I picked this up to use with my Galaxy Note 3 and simply have not been that pleased with it.  Everyone has their opinions and I am just not crazy about it but it does hold the phone well.
2	Purchased the pouch for the Galaxy note II. Very roomy holds Note II plus cover.The design is great. Draw back to this case is the belt clip which started to tear off after about a week of use. Material for belt loop and clip could be made stronger. This is why I'm giving only two stars.
2	I did not purchase this for the listed application. I wanted an oversize holster to fit my Samsung Galaxy S III with an extended battery or protective case. The phone slides in and out of the case easily for either application. The pouch itself is a bit bulky for my taste and could stand to be about 1/2 inch narrower. The belt clip will not turn to provide additonal comfort which would be my preference.Overall it works for what I bought it for. It is a good solution but not a perfect one. The pouch appears to be of good construction and will likely last me for several years of use.
2	Poorly designed. I won't use it because I worry about losing my phone.I have a Samsung Galaxy Note II and was looking for a vertical holster. It's a large phone and awkward to carry on your person. I tried a horizontal holster which was just too big (it was designed for a phone with an Otterbox).I have a plastic protective case (not a large one) on my phone so I was happy when I got this one and my phone fit perfectly. Not too loose that the phone shakes around. However the clip sits right in the middle of the holster so when you are wearing this the whole thing is top-heavy...the top of the holster leans away from your body making it very easy to bump it with your arm or bump it against something causing the holster to unclip from your clothing.It's probably fine if you wear a belt (I don't) and can slip the holster through that but the design of holster makes wearing this phone on your person awkward.Disappointed and still looking for the perfect holster.
0	I had high hopes for this but was let down hard. It sounded like I was inside a tin can. I tried it with the Noise Shield on and off but no difference. The caller on the other end didn't notice that effect but the removal of background noise for them was no better than my favorite the Plantronics Voyager 510. The other big issue was the fit. The ear loop is slightly spring loaded to keep the mouthpiece sensor pressing against your cheek. This is intended to allow the sensor to differentiate between your voice and the background sounds. The problem was that the spring tension of the ear loop was slightly pushing the headset off my ear. It comes with several ear bud sizes and two ear loop sizes. I tried them all on both ears. No luck. It was held on so loosely that the slightest lean of my head to that side and off it came. Completely unacceptable and far worse than all the others I've tried. I have tested 8 different headsets. The way I do my tests is to pair two headsets put one in each ear and then switch between them while on the same call. Even if I ignore the fit problem (a deal breaker for me) the sound quality was poor. Worse for me than the caller but why bother I'll stick with my 510.
2	I purchased this at the local AT&T; store as I needed a headset immediately when my two year old Motorola finally died. After purchasing two replacement Motorola H700s that worked for 3 weeks each and died I was up for a change. A friend had recently purchased a Jawbone and told me her friends picked up her call from an airport and they said it sounded great. That was appealing to me so off I went.The 1st Jawbone was dead on arrival out of the box. It wouldn't light up to charge. AT&T; cheerfully replaced it a few hours later the same day. 2 weeks later the wire earloop about the diameter of a paperclip snapped where it goes through the main body of the Jawbone. They ship 6 in total which are either right or left ear only. The second failed about two weeks later. The issue seems to be that the loop material is either too brittle or to small in diameter in the name of fashion. The shape of the Jawbone is a little awkward to carry with you when it's not being worn. In a computer case it can't really be flat so the pressure from the side of the bag snaps it. The same thing happened when I put it in my jacket pocket. When I put on the seat belt in the car it gently rubbed against the coat and number two was toast. The third one snapped in half when I was putting it on.One more thing - bring a friend or a mirror when you go to look at one. It pulls my ear funny so it sticks out which never happened with the Motorola. I am going to try the Blue Ant next and see how that one fairs. For now the Jawbone looks like a future good product once they re-engineer the ear loops so they aren't so fragile.
2	It never fit right in my ear even though it comes with different rubber ear inserts.Everyone always complained they couldn't hear me.I at best could hear the other person very slightly. I tried it for a day and returned it.
2	This headset was a great deal but it's difficult not to think you get what you pay for...  friends tell me when I am using this headset with my Apple iPhone that I sound like a robot sometimes with the weird background static noise that it creates.The earbuds are comfortable but it lacks a clip near the microphone to attach it to your shirt/sweater/jacket/whatever. Reception on my end seems good and I can actually hear people better than when I am just using my iPhone in its case.These do occasionally get caught on things when I am wearing them arounbd the house because without that clip they tend to hang down as I am doing things  around the house.  They get ripped out of my ears and sometimes out of the phone just walking by the corner of the bed or something without paying attention.Then again I'm a bit of a clutz so this may not apply to you...  Not expensive and they work well from my end although sometimes they affect how I sound at the other end apparently.  Decent but could be better.
2	The sound quality was the worst I have ever heard from any earbuds I have experienced.However the volume was so much louder than other earbuds I think the problem is that of a speaker being used at the wrong impedance.These may be set for a much lower (6-8Ohms) impedance and when played from an Iphone the volume goes up but the sound quality goes OUT.
2	It's my fault for not reading the description more carefully; but hopefully someone can learn from my error.  This headset was not compatible with my HTC Evo 3D.
0	has the lowest quality i have ever seen.i purchased the cheapest i got it.
0	I bought this bluetooth after using another model of Plantronics bluetooth to death. I liked it a lot but it was a little bulky so I went for a slimmer model this time; the Explorer 330. FORGET IT! It won't stay in my ear. It makes my ear so sore that I can hardly force myself to wear it (I have to have it for my job) and if I get four feet away from my cell I get static. I'm VERY disappointed with this model and will be returning it.
2	I got this for my wife.  It worked for a few months then it simply wouldn't come on anymore.  We have no idea why.  Save your money and get a better quality headset. That's just my opinion
2	The arm on this mount is way too long. It might be useful on something other than a windshield. It did stick well though.
2	I was overall quite happy with this mount. It stuck to the windshield well. It held my device well. It was quite adjustable (allowing both landscape and portrait mode and easy changing between them).But after only 6 months the ball joint failed and could no longer support any weight. This meant that my phone screen just flopped downwards and pointed at the floor (in any orientation). After trying to deal with this I finally had to remove it from my vehicle because it was causing dangerous driving conditions and it was better to just hold the phone in my hand than to deal with the defective mount.Good design but poor quality materials or build quality.
2	I bought this item on eBay (refurbished brand new but out of box)- and it is just amazing.  WiFi Camera Video (you need to upgrade the firmware) and a full keyboard - what a great phone.Very small issues - sometimes the network cuts out (AT&T;'s problem **EDIT:  no it's not -- it's a problem with unlocked phones picking up signals from multiple carriers! **) no mainstream IM client no way to check email or use IM over WiFi and the browser needs work.  I'm sure BB will fix these issues with later phones.The buttons are a little small (I have fingers like sausages) but I've learned to type using my thumbs nonetheless.Add an 8GB MicroSD card and you're in business!  I don't need an MP3 player anymore!To reiterate find the phone unlocked if you can.  Mine says T-Mobile when it starts up but since it's unlocked I just pop in my AT&T; card and it works fine.**EDIT:  Unlocked phones might not work.  After two years of dropped calls the phone shutting off by itself and listening to other people's phone calls I'll stick to provider phones from now on.
2	This is another superb device made by Blackberry.  The Curve is a full qwerty keyboard smartphone and has the ability to use wifi to surf the internet and make calls via UMA.However...most services won't work with the Curve UNLESS you sign up for a data plan with T-Mobile.  You would think the wifi ability would have some sort of push email function for free but it does not you have to pay for that.  The wi-fi only allows you to do basic web browsing.  Web pages are not html style and are mobile style.  Looks like crap actually.  Only real good use is to read some news or articles.  You cannot use features such as Yahoo Go Google Maps or Push E-Mail.  The push email goes through the blackberry server so it is not T-mobile's fault.  $10 for push email or $20 for email and data.Blackberry's are powerful devices but you have to pay for that full power to be unleashed.  Get the data plan.  You could also use this as a  media player as it plays back mp3 and video but you will have to buy a separate memory card for that as the one supplied is only 256 mb.However since this is a hotspot enabled phone I use this for work since I can talk all day and night without having my minutes deducted via the hotspot@home feature ($10 per household all UMA phones on the plan can use it for one charge).  The speaker phone on this thing is loud sharp and amazing.  It's probably the lightest Blackberry I have used besides the Pearl.Calls via UMA are clear and sharp.  No problems so far.If you are looking for a UMA phone go with the Blackberry Curve.  Just remember you can't do email without paying for it.I would give this phone 5 stars if only the wifi could be used for more than basic web browsing and uma calls.  Give me free push email via wi-fi and it would be a 5 star!
2	Its ok but it isn't very precise with writing.  The tip is very broad and so the best you can do is get a broad pen font - like writing with a piece of chalk.  Also maybe it is the way I write but the letters fail to fully form when writing - looks like you are writing with an ink pen that is running out of ink.  Great for pointing and selection on a touch screen.
0	Cozip case is simply just a case!!It can only protect the iphones BACK thats it.Cozip case does not protect the phone from breaking when it drops there is no schock on it at all.Its like not having a case at all.Positive side is that it makes the iphone more cooler its a stylish case not for protectionyou just have to be extra careful with the phonebecause if it drops! it will surely be the end of an expensive IPHONE.I recomend this case just for style.
2	It's an average quality case/skin and will do the trick. Beware: If you get the Amazon bundle with the Screen Protector and Headphone adapter you will be paying shipping for each of the three items. FYI - this has no bearing on my rating of this case just know that the two cents more that you pay is not all you pay after figuring the shipping - it's more like $12 more. Avoid the bundle and buy it all from the same seller to avoid the triple ship charge. ;)
2	This is a nice looking case the only problem I had with this was that the inside is not painted looks like they tried using just enough paint on the outside to make it look good. I guess it doesn't really matter once the case is snaped on to the phone but it still bugs me to see the poor quality...If you must buy this style of case you might want to consider one called Kroo Shell I'm not sure if they make it for the 1st Gen iPhone though.
2	protect finish on back. it does nothing for the front of phone. It has a minimal profile and fits in pouches or pocket well. I would recommend this case to someone who needs a minimal case with little protection for phone.
0	HOLY MOLY what a piece of garbage!  This has got to be the cheapest/dumbest iPhone case ever made!  Let me begin:I have an iPhone 4S 64 gig phone thing.  I wanted a cheap black case for it.  I wasn't too concered with protection or whatever - just something to cover it.  This one looks good.  Look at the pics - looks nice right?  Wrong!It's a cheap piece of bended metal/plastic.  My phone fits in it - kinda - but it sure doesn't feel secure!  It's like a rounded piece of plastic - whereas your phone if you'll observe it - has SQUARED edges!  The part that really bugged me is that it doesn't fit snug AT ALL: See the main photo here?  The one where you can see the back of the phone?  See how that apple symbol on the back of the phone lines up nice and flush with the back?  that is a LIE!  It's not flush at all!  There's like a huge GAP between the back of the phone and the back of this case - it feels TERRIBLE.Most of the ports are accessible when this thing is on - but good luck using the volume switches on the side of your iphone!  You CAN'T.  This case has this rounded-edge thing going on which prevents your fingertips from getting to those side switches. What a dumb design!-Seriously - I know you're looking for a cheap case - this ain't it!  Believe me when I tell you to spend a few bucks more and get something you'll actually USE and ENJOY.  This is utter garbage!
2	I think my ear is pretty normal in shape.  But this headset won't stay on unless I stabilize the too thin ear holder with the temple of my glasses.  If I wear contacts the headset slips off in less than two minutes.  Aside from that the sound quality is adequate if a bit too soft and people tell me that they can hear me well.  It synchs easily with my bluetooth Motorola phone.  It is very lightweight and compact with a well designed combination storage/charging unit.  Plus I find that I don't have to charge it very often.The other negative is that there are problems with interference in noisy environments when I'm talking on the phone.On the whole I'd say you really need to try this one on for a few minutes and physically test it before you buy it.  If it fits your ear you should buy it.  It's inexpensive and does the job.  But if you're like me you need a headset with a more hefty ear holder.
2	I've had excellent success with Jabra Bluetooth handsfree products in the past especially when used with Sony Ericsson mobile phones. In particular my JX-10 and SP500 were the epitomes of compatibility usability and quality. So when I shopped for a new in-ear headset the BT8040 seemed the obvious choice.My primary gripe with this unit is how its voice dialing DOES NOT WORK with the Sony Ericsson K790a even though the Jabra site claims It Will Work :) . The earpiece never receives the audio prompt from the phone so the phone waits forever for a voice command it can never receive. I tried my phone with other headsets (OEM wired one Aliph Jawbone Moto H700) which all worked fully and flawlessly so the phone is not at fault. I went through severl procedures with Jabra who ultimately replaced the headset all without success. Also my older phones (an S710a and T637) woked perfectly well. So there's clearly a compatibility issue once which Jabra refuses to acknowledge.Second the BT8040 is a step backwards in usability from the JX-10. On the JX-10 all headset functions (initiate call via voice dialing answer call end call) required a single short button press and handsfree functions (reject incoming call redial last call call waiting switch etc.) needed only a single long button press. That couldn't be easier. The BT8040 changes some of this for the worse such as in requiring a double-press for voice dialing while still requiring single short- and long-presses for other functions. Jabra found perfection in its controls and usability and lost it.Finally the BT8040's eargel version 2 does not adequately keep the headset from rorating around in or falling out of your ear. The separately sold Jabra Eargels v.1 (which I used with my JX-10) are more stable and more comfortable. Sadly these v.1 eargels do not fit this headset.With the BT8040 Jabra's maintained their other attributes - functionality call quality and volume build quality small size and light weight - hence I give it 2 stars instead of one. But the incompatibility is unacceptable especially with Sony Ericsson phones (the kings of Bluetooth). The lacking usability and stability further diminish the BT8040's desirability.
2	I bought this headset in Aug 08.  Initially I really liked it. The size was small and it is very light.  It fit in my ear really well.  It seemed to work fine for about a month or 2 and then I began having complaints that people couldn't understand me.  The problem is this: To have the volume up loud enough to hear anyone caused my outgoing voice to be so loud that it made my speech sound slurred.  Also this headset didn't manage background noise well as I often had complaints.  Callers sometimes complained of an echo tooThe unfortunate truth is that I received so many complaints that I had to get rid of the head set after only 4 months. What a waste of money!(Incidentally I replaced this headset with the Plantronics Voyager 510.  After 1 month of usage I like it alot!  Callers can hear me clearly and I can hear them well.  It also eliminates a great deal of background noise.)
0	I really wanted this to work out! Needed a headset with noise reduction so I could use it in the car. Callers can't understand me when I'm at my desk and in the car is worse. I made sure to remove any plastic covers and upgraded the firmware. Many people praise the audio quality so there must be a lot of variations in the units. I know mine sucks.
0	I tested this unit against 8 other headsets and it had the worst sound quality by far. I still can't beleive it! Considering the special features designed for sound quality I was expecting the best sound ever but oh well. The way I compared headsets was to pair two at a time put one in each ear and then switch between them while on the same call. This allowed me and the caller to compare sound quality equally while in a variety of environments and from both ends of the call. I tested these headsets: Jabra BT8040 Jabra BT500 Plantronics Voyager 510 Plantronics Explorer 320 Motorola HS850 Motorola H700 Jawbone Samsung WEP200. The problem was that the sound quality for the caller was so bad that they could hardly understand a word I said. If I held the unit a few inches in front of my mouth they could hear me clearly but not when it was in my ear. With all the other units I tested I go through a series of background noise tests with both the caller and myself talking and listening but in this case we weren't able to comunicate well enough to get that done. After testing the other units we went back and tried this one some more but nothing seemed to make a difference. This is a beautifull headset. It looks great feels great with great function and fit but if they can't understand what I'm saying then there's no point. Man I'm bummed! And I really liked this one too!
2	Poor quality for other person on the line to hear...happens with all calls..dont waste your money...spend more
2	I'm returning this item because it uses a micro not mini USB connector.Every accessory I have uses mini-USB including my cell phone.  As a result I have tons of mini-USB chargers including standard USB cables.  This headset is not compatible with them.Keeping this unit charged will be a pain so it's going back.
2	This headset is comfortable and has good styling but barely lasted past the warranty period before people could no longer hear you when you talk..
0	This headset wasn't the best quality - it was great for me the talker but the mic didn't work so well. The person on the other end often had a hard time hearing me when I was talking in a quiet environment (forget it when in the car!). I'd recommend something else.
2	I bought this because of the supposed noise reduction and/or 'noise cancellation features.What the ad should have said is background noise enhancement feature.The headset does a good job of cancelling background noises on MY end so that I can't hear them.  It does exactly the opposite for the person I'm talking to; instead it picks up every noise and sends it to the other party.When I'm using this headset people I talk to often complain that they can't understand me due to background noises.  In some cases I have to turn off the H710 and use the cellphone itself at which point people invariably say that it sounds much clearer.  Any noise in the vicinity gets equal weight with my voice.  This can't be used outside if there's wind or even a light breeze because the other party won't be able to understand much of what is said.  If there's an air conditioner running the headset will broadcast it loud and clear to the other end.  A television gets equal billing with what I'm saying.  Any noise at all will be picked up and sent to the other person.The battery life of the H710 is good and the headset does turn on and off easily.  But the background noise amplification is self-defeating and for that reason I can't recommend this headset.
2	These were inexpensive so I can forgive that they have flaws but still you have to find the right spot to get them to work sometimes so if you were planning on using these while doing some kind of physical activity I would not recommend them instead these are best for connecting something and simply leaving it be.
0	This item gets a dry-joint in the iphone side of the connection in a few short weeks. And then you're stuck with it.
2	Didn't work for connecting a card reader to a smart phone. It was useless but the price was so low at $1.76 so it was not worth the try to the post office.
2	I thought this purchase would come in handy but as I upgraded my IPhone it no-longer fits. Now I have to buy a jack to go with a jack.
0	I ordered 2 of this item and 2 of theblack onesfrom 4 different sellers after reading very mixed reviews on both items.  I needed the adapter pictured on both with the very short plastic head between the male plug and the cord.  None of the 4 I received were the same as the item pictured. My reason for needing this is not the iPhone. It is to fit inside a tight spot on the back of a Makita job site radio.Without any regular use or ware and tear each one sounded nearly identical when tested with music on an iPhone 4S and SkullCandy in-ear headphones. I am not an audiophile the headphones are inexpensive and the adapters have not been put under any stress yet.Here's my report of each adapter:White adapter received from seller CRONUZ - 1 star:The cord feels flimsy. The plastic used on the cord and ends feels very rubbery. From my own experience with iPhone cases made of similar material I suspect this cord with discolor and/or become dirty beyond cleaning if it doesn't break before that.White adapter received from seller eTECH (mailing label said iflash Inc) - 1 star:The item looks identical to the one from CRONUZ. The only additional concern with this adapter is that I can't get the headphones to plug into this without using A LOT of force.  I did force them in to test the sound quality but I don't plan on using this cord again. Also because the 2 white adapters look identical I would think this is a problem you might encounter no matter who you order from.Black adapterreceived from seller Eforcity (not this listing) - 3 stars:This adapter also has a flimsy cord. The plastic on the male end is slimmer and will fit into a tighter spot than the 2 white ones I tested.  The hard plastic ends seem a little more durable than the ends of the white ones. I believe I can get some use out of this one but wouldn't buy another one.Black adapterreceived from seller Elago Design (not this listing) - 5 stars:First of all the 5 stars is based on this being less than $2. I wouldn't say this is the best adapter you can buy. This is however the best one I tested. The cord is stiffer and feels more solid than the others.  The female plug has a tighter fit and no play. The plastic around the male end is slimmer than all the rest. This cord doesn't meet my immediate needs because of the longer plastic head but I would buy this again for use with certain iPhone cases that block larger plugs.If you order this or any other item and don't receive what was pictured and listed contact the seller.  Most of them would rather just give you a refund because they know they are shipping a different brand than what is listed.
2	This thing broke on me after 4 months.  Good thing I purchased 3.  The relief on this adapter is not that sturdy but it works really well for a good amount of time.  I had better luck with the same item from SF planet seller.
0	Shipping service is terrible.  Don't expect to receive your order for at least 2 weeks.  Product feels cheaply made like the wire will snap at any moment and above all it does not work if you need all 4 channels.
0	I bought two of these to help make keeping my otter box case on when needed to use the speaker/aux cable.The first cable worked for about 1 hour before it began to fray and separate.  The second one only gave audio out of one side.  You could pull the cable out slightly and get both channels (sides) but if your gizmo (phone tablet mp3 player) moves the slightest then it stops working on both sides.The other bad thing is the static it creates when in use (aux or headphones).The item is junk and I would avoid unless you like throwing away money.
2	Needed for a gen 1 iPhone because of the silly reassessed headphone jack. This solved the problem but I still feel like I shouldn't need it.
0	Very simply this product does not work.  Using it makes the sound very muffled to the point where it's almost inaudible.  Consider that there are MANY other reviews saying the same thing.  I should have heeded their advice and not bought this.
2	Bought this audio dongle for the sole purpose of using it in conjunction with my iPad Mini's LifeProof Fre's deep recessed headphone port & my Monster iSport Victory right-angle jack.  The jack's housing fits & passes Left & Right audio channels but I can't control a fully-functional in-line controls of my Monster iSport Victory in-ear earphones.  No matter how much I twist the connection to make it connect I couldn't use the in-line controls.  The cable seems thin & I'm concern that it might not last as well.  iPad Mini on iOS 6.1.3 while the iPad 2 is on iOS 7.0 if it matters.  I'll update this review once I get the chance to try it with my Beats MixR headphones (in-line control cable also have a right-angle jack).
0	These things got such bad reviews - that I ordered 3 just to be sure I got one good one (at least they're cheap). I gave them two stars instead of one since oddly 2 of 3 of them worked for their intended purpose (a size adapter for my iPhone) though none of them work when plugged into my PC. Hard to imagine this is a very difficult product to manufacture - so I just assume the manufacturer could simply care less...UPDATE: Turns out my 2 star review was way too generous. All 3 of these eventually stopped working properly. A truly staggering level of apathy by the manufacturer...
0	It worked only for two months then stopped working well it works on one side only the other earphone get no sound.
2	This does not work with a RedEye Mini infrared adapter.I bought this to use with a RedEye infrared adapter on my iPhone 3GS (RedEye mini Plug-in Universal Remote Adapter for iPhone iPod touch and iPad) which is in an Otterbox Defender case (OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 3G 3GS (Black)[Retail Packaging]). The RedEye Mini is too fat to fit into the headphone jack slot of the Otterbox case so I thought an adapter would be a good solution. Unfortunately it does not work for this purpose.It does work as a headphone extender but for that purpose I have no use as I don't use headphones with my iPhone.I have not tested with the Square credit card reader. I will try that soon and report back.
0	I purchased this item and it would not work when the headphone was plugged in all the way...the sound was muffled.  But it worked fine when the headphone was plugged in 3/4 of the way.  Eforcity sent me a replacement at no charge but unfortunately the replacement doesn't work at all.
0	Does not give you Left and Right channels like it should. Music in unbearable and incorrect. Do not buy this.
0	This does not let me use a 2.5 mm headset. The description now represents that accurately but did not at the time I ordered it.
2	it worked but there was a problem when i connected it the speakers sound switched from left to right. i used this for my logitech computer speakers when i play bf4 on my computer i noticed bullets and helicopters where on the opposite side from where i was looking thats how i new it was wrong but with the logitech the speakers can be interchanged so that was my quick fix or you can move the speakers around but that was my problem other than that it worked great!!!
0	Beware you will not get the item that is pictured.  You will get some sort of iPhone recessed port adapter (kinda like the Belkin one) but not nearly as good as the one in the picture.I gave mine away.  I hope this prevents people from getting ripped off.The seller even tried to get to recall this negative comment and promised a refund.  NEVER RECEIVED A REFUND.Tells you what kind of seller you're dealing with.
0	Purchased from Eforcity US seller that I've gotten a few items from before and quality was good for the price.  Not this case.  Item is the proper fit and fits bumper cases or special cases that would only accept an Apple headphone jack (ie thin).But at first I was getting audio from just one channel - Jiggling a bit the cable at the base of the male end 2nd channel started working but was getting static noise by just moving the cable.Audio would then come and go by briefly moving the cable.Filed claim for damaged item.  Seems to me a $1.70 down the drain.
2	I use a Mophie Juice Pack Plus on my iPhone 5 and the head phone Jack is not easy to access because of the case. When you buy the case it does come with a Headphone adapter but I used it so much the wires on the inside of the adapter broke and I had to throw it away. When I found these I was excited because they are really cheap and I could buy as many as five for back up well. When I purchased two of them they took a very long time to end up at my front door and that is a problem for huge music lovers like myself. When I finally got them I was excited and I plugged it into my phone right away. There was a huge surprise the sound in my headphones sound distorted and when I unplugged it and plugged it back in it still sounded distorted. Eventually the adapter did work when it wanted to. I did a little troubleshooting and it was the adapter that caused the audio distortion. Why this occurred I really don't know why. One day I accidentally dropped one of the adapters into my soda and after that it works when it wants to now I use the other one and that works a lot better then the other adapter I dropped in my soda but it still has its days where you can hear distortion. I would look for another adapter if you are looking for one like this.
2	I really like the phone it's great but it would be nice if the serive for it would be cheaper. The data plan is 30 bucks a month. I recently found out that for Iphones it's only 20 bucks seems like a rip off to me that I have to pay an additional 10 bucks a month for data because it's a different phone.The phone has a lot of nice features like the blackberry messenger search functions for going through your address book and a whole long list of other functions. The Trackball is really nice as well! makes getting stuff easy and much quicker.Full keyboard is nice as well lets me get the typing done quite fast.While I have found that AT&T; seems to be a much better company than Sprint or Nextel (so glad to be rid of them) AT&T; still have their plan prices too high. They raise their prices because the like to say that they are all over the place. Yet most people never actually leave their city/surrounding areas for it to matter.If it weren't for that fact that I get a good enough discount through the company that I work for to offset the price of AT&Ts; plans I wouldn't have bothered with AT&T.;Yeah they have provided me pretty good service but I expect that from any company that I PAY (this is the reason I left Nextel their service/customer reps are the worst ever).The rollover factor is nice but it's a little overrated in my opinion. I find that they just don't offer a broad set of plans. they pretty much give you the either or method. You either get this little plan that you might run over and you get to pay us crazy overage fees or you get the next plan up that results in you paying a heck of a lot more monthly but if you don't use all those minutes we don't care because we will just charge you for them anyway.it would be nice if they would offer something more like a 300600900 set of plans. would allow people to meet their needs a little better and not have to pay for what they aren't going to use on a regular basis.
2	I had to return this phone after 2 days It would reboot itself and or just lockup. I read about this before. It did have the latest firmware.  The price was $517 when I ordered it dropped to $488 now. The nokia n95 8g  was 639 and that day I returned Nokia has it for $579 for like a day.  However the drawback with the phone.  I use a treo and a blackberry. The lack of a keyboard is hard to deal with.  I really wanted to like the device it does allot.  The camera features are nice  the 8g version seems to be the better way to go in terms of os since I think it has more operating memory.  Nokia is releasing the N96 soon then the Nokia Tube hence the price drops.  But it did work ok on att 3g wifi worked  the lock ups and freezing was not acceptable for a phone that cost $500.
0	This looked like an interesting and relatively low-cost option for my wife's car/cell phone since she hasn't found a bluetooth headset that fits her ear comfortably.  Unfortunately we cannot get this unit to pair with any of three cell phones (iPhone 3G two new Nokias).  It goes into pairing mode as advertised but none of our phones can find it (they all find all of the headsets and computers we have tried pairing with other than this unit).  Makes this rather useless and I would strongly suggest testing your phone against one of these before ordering.Also disappointed in the lack of a USB or AC charger.  My fault for not noticing that this only comes with a car charger - not very convenient for how we typically charge.No issues with the merchant - quickly shipped and delivered just fine.  The low rating here is about the speakerphone not the merchant.
0	Could barely be heard when using this bluetooth device and not easy to hear who I called. Got progressively worse as power level was discharged. I do not recommend this product. My Garmin NUVI 660 has better bluetooth audio quality.
2	Got the first one loved it...worked great with my ipod and my phone...so I could listen to music and still be available to answer calls...(I have a basic phone not a smartphone.)  The first one stopped charging after about 2 months...got a replacement...stopped taking a charge after two months...This is too expensive to work for only two months and then nothing.  Too Bad.
2	got it this weekthe dog-tag look make it looks cool and can put the included chain over neck may be good for gymI don't use included earphone but I use Bose one sound is very good no drop off within rangenearly 7 hours battery with music playback is close to advertisedit has miniUSB charging port this is pretty handy as some new 4-digit models have this port as wellit has bt2.0 which can greatly reduce interference with wifi with other bt1.2 models I have hard time to get wifi reception but with this one the problem is gone (connect to netbook with bt2.0 adapter)but this client has a strange behavior which may trouble some if using it with more than one deviceI use it with netbook and PDA (HP211) and found AVRCP only works with last paired device if the last paired device is the netbook it'll work with netbook and AVRCP doesn't work with HP211 except I pair again since I use it primary with HP211 it's not big dealif you use it with laptop and watch video (no matter local player or streaming) make sure it doesn't have drop-off because it may have audio lag problemno matter it has such wierd behavior it still works perfectly with HP211 once they're paired again
2	I don't know how they can sell this charger so cheap but the three bucks it cost for shipping sure beats the forty dollars sprint wants for one. The one they gave me with my phone broke the first trip I took it on but this one I got on amazon has been working great! Thanks Amazon!!!
2	As another reviewer mentioned the iphone adapter becomes stressed and breaks over time. Mine lasted about 6 months and I'm very gentle with my electronics. The plastic release tabs on the side both broke and then the main clamshell came apart. I really like the CallPod because it allows charging of our Blackberry cell phone and iphone all at the same location with only one plug in the wall. But the quality of this adapter isn't that great.Written by Arthur Bradley author of the Handbook to Practical Disaster Preparedness for the Family.
0	Bought this to use with my iPhone 3GS. When I plugged it in I got the 'not for iPhone' charging message. Sure enough it doesn't charge properly. The problem is that even when I've taken care to make sure it's securely seated it won't consistently charge so there's no telling with any certainty when you unplug your phone in the morning that it'll be charged.Callpod charges my old LG phone my husband's Blackberry and my Nintendo DS all flawlessly.  This adapter was a bust. Haven't tried it with my husband's iPod Touch so can't say how it works for that device.
2	after a couple of months this adapter's housing around the ipod end of the plug fell apart.  When that happened one of the pieces got lost so i wasn't able to glue it back together.  I later decided to replace the whole callpod adapter with a powered usb hub.  everything i needed to charge can be powered by usb anyway and with this setup i have no proprietary plugs or equipment to deal with.
0	these are the cheapest chargers i have ever purchased. not only did some of them not work after a while some apple devices did not recognize them as an authorized charger. you pay what you get for. they were cheap in price and cheap in quality.
2	It works fine but the cord only extends to 2 ft.  Think it should be at least 3 or 4 feet.
0	I bought this set base on a lot of reviews saying it charge their Ipods. What I didn't realized is what kind of ipod they have they might have a 3G nano as we know won't work with 4G nano. I tried the car charger it works but can not play and charge at the same time. For the house charger it doesn't. I look at the label and it say compatible with ipod 3G. However the product description says compatible with 3G 4G nano etc. I bought this to enable me to charge without having my computer running. The car charger is important if you are in your car for a long period of time charging without playing. Not worth returning the postage cost more than the items.
2	kinda cheap works ok. not sure if it really works charging other usb things though. i hooked up my zune to it and it made the battery get really hot. but its not for the zune so i cant complain
0	Neither of these chargers worked with any of the ipods in our house -- not the iPod touch not the iPhone and not the iPod Classics.It has been my experience with off-brand chargers that sometimes they will actually be charging even though the charge light does not light and sometimes that the item will work if you wiggle the connection or throw salt over your shoulder while attempting to get it to work.  Nothing made these work.I left each item connected for between 8-24 hours each to find out if any of the ipods charged and they didn't.
2	Looks cheap but works. Did not last long. Easy to install. Installation was easy and looks stylish. I wouldn't purchase again.
2	It doesn't cost that much so thats a pro.  But it fails at it's main purpose--Consistently charging the iphone 3G--. It was very haphazard.  Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.  And finally it just stopped working.
0	I bought this because others bought it with the case I purchased. It was one of those last minute checkout decisions. I should have read the reviews better. Worked for a day after I received it then my 4th Gen iPod touch gives a message the charger isnt supported. The reviews are a little scary. The last thing I want is to fry my iPod. Not sure if I will bother returning it considering the price. I will probably keep the retractable cable and toss the chargers.
2	nice kit for the road but i haven't tried it yet but it should be liable enough lol.
2	these are intermittent dont waste your time on the aftermarket products they just dont last not worth the hassle of wondering if it will work
0	I BOUGHT THE ITEM.I RECEIVE 2 BLACK AND 1 WHITE.I WILL NOT BUY MORE FROM THIS SUPPLIER.
0	Stopped working in few days. No mishandling no rough use Just stopped working Seems some mfg defect. I wont buy this again
0	Within a few weeks the plastic covering near the plug ripped exposing the wires and after two months it stopped working. Not durable enough for cell phone use.
2	Great product. Didn't realize it wasn't a 1/8 to 1/8  slim fit extension like I was looking to get. Bad on my part. Otherwise - low cost & decent quality
0	This piece has never worked.  I have a headset that works fine on my home phone that I wanted to convert for my office.  But there is this consistent pulsing I hear and every caller tells me I am fading in and out.  It's like a bad corded bluetooth.
0	picture is misleading - doesn't have the 3 stripes you'd need for the iPhone - only 2 stripes.  Doesn't work as advertized.
0	Maybe I looked at the description wrong. But it just doesnt work. Perhaps i dont realize that there are many different types of these connectors for the SAME size? The problem seems to be that the stereo speakers should have been wired together for a mono sound but they aren't?Who knows and I'm not about to rewire it. I bought a simple ear piece/boom mic from here and tried to use with my Droid. No go for me.Your mileage may vary
0	I tried to use this for a plantronics headset but the mic wouldn't work.  I was able to hear the other side just fine. Don't order this it doesn't work as advertised.  One review mentioned that it worked perfectly when he purchased it back in 2008.  That person added onto his review to say that they changed something in the design because he has this same problem with the adapter.  Just a heads up before you buy and are disappointed.
2	The charger makes some high frequency noise when it's not charging. I have to unplug it every time I finish charging being scared that it might get burned. Other than that everything is just fine.
0	I bought this to charge my old Nokia phone because I couldn't find the original charger that came with the phone. This charger worked fine for the first few weeks but then it decided to stop working out of the blue. I have no idea what happened but it just wouldn't charge the phone. I had to throw it out because I saw no point in keeping something that doesn't work.
0	These are complete cheaters. First of all the charger never fit my N73 phone slot. Secondly after I wrote my 1st review criticisizing the product they called me up saying that they will send me a new replacement charger and I should remove my negative feedback from Amazon. I waited for almost 3 weeks and the charger never showed up. I tried calling the same number from where I got the call and no response.Complete waste of money waste of time and a useless product which I had to trash in 10 minutes after I received it.
2	Bought abt 6 of these an half worked an half didn't! The ones that worked got the job done didn't last long! But for the cheap price what more should I expect. Won't b buying any more of these
2	The connection is bad and many times when I talk I can hear myself again which means it echos like crazy and its not worth it to get something that will not work
0	I ordered an OEM blackberry Headset a months ago & it was just like the one that came with my Storm could not tell the difference & the Amazon seller was BTO Inc.I placed another order for my wife headset three weeks later & this time was offered by Amazon seller the OEM shop for the same price. Since it stated it is an OEM item I placed the order. Now that I received the order it is very different than the first one that I ordered. The original blackberry headset & my first order both have a very soft & flexible wire. But the one that I received from The OEM Shop has a very stiff & hard wire not very flexible & it feels that it is going to break when folding it. I think it is a counterfeit of Blackberry OEM one. I will never buy from The OEM shop. It is not worth to send it back. So here is my Rating for this Item:The original & the one came from BTO Inc. gets 5 stars.The one sold by The OEM Shop gets 1 star.
2	If you listen to earbuds then these headphones are great. If you are used to better quality sound then you will notice the poor sound quality in these headphones. Pairing was easy and simple however; I purchased a deffective pair that would not hold a charge.
2	It looks like the right charger there's power coming through it but it doesn't charge the phone. I even tested it with a multimeter. Then I went out and got an identical charger at Walmart and that worked fine. Go figure.
0	These adapters didn't last more than a few days of daily use before breaking. Ironically they all failed just above the strain relief on the male plug.When these fail you'll see exposed wires or the male end will break off - which in a way is a nice change from other adapters that fail internally and still look OK from the outside.
0	I am not sure how somebody can screw up a simple audio cable extender cable but these guys have done it. It is impossible to create a solid connection both inside the iPhone and when connecting the headphone jack. Once everything is snuggly plugged in the slightest rotation/jerk of the cable in the iphone produces hiss and loss of contact. Same goes for the headphone jack. It's like these things are made not to maintain a continuous contact where they're supposed to have a contact. Avoid at all costs.
0	Sound out of one ear only. In-line remote controls don't work. No mic functionality either. This doesn't appear to do anything other than waste your money.Go to the Radtech web site where you'll find a similar product except it actually WORKS PROPERLY. It's called the Procable Shortz Audio Extender. Unfortunately it isn't for sale here on Amazon.
0	I bought this to use it with P.O.S. credit card readers (most don't fit my phone while it has a case on) and I made sure it was a four-pole connector. Although the seller did give me a full refund without question my cable didn't work at all with any of the CC readers I have.
0	I'm not sure how long this worked for...my girlfriend noticed that when she pushed the connection slightly the bass would suddenly get richer....tested on a Nano and an iPhone 4S. Disappointing but it's a super-cheap cable so....I missed the Amazon claim window by 2 weeks but Eforcity only covers this for 30 days. Where other companies would send out a replacement no questions asked this company does not. Buyer beware.NOTE: the connector did fit into the iPhone even with the case on which was why I purchased it to begin with.
2	I wanted to like these headphones and I tried everything to no avail. The title to this review summarizes these headphones.  That said let me start with what I did like:Pros:-Good design the mic is on the left side so you never have to wonder which side is right and which is left.-The mic is separated from the answer button this is great as it keeps the mic small so you don't have a large piece of plastic hanging off your ear.-Very stylish and sturdy (though I didn't care for the carry bag much).-Stop/Next/Answer button works perfectly.-Cord extension is great.So far so good.  Now for the one con: audio quality.  The bass is non-existent.  I have owned canal earphones before and I know what a good seal feels like (so fit was not an issue).  I also tried all three silicone pieces before settling on the mid-sized piece.I also burned the headphones in overnight as maximo recommends but still mediocre bass.I also tried setting the EQ on my iPhone to Loudness but that did not help.  I'm not a bass head but I do like solid bass response and was quite disappointed.Outside of the bass issue i also found that there was focus on mid range without great highs (i wonder if this is to emphasize audio conversations but I can't say for sure.Finally the design of the silicone eartips doesn't not create a good seal.  You may have a different experience with your ear so take that with a grain of salt.My last set of headphones was made by skull-candy and i found the earpieces there to be much better.In the end I sent them back and am looking at ultimatebuds fs1.
2	There is no way that these were originally $70 headphones.  Yes I liked them for a while and worked great with the iPhone. Sound was pretty good and great for call.  Then they suddenly just stopped working on the one ear wire looked connected fine I was able to wiggle it to get some sounds for a little while but overall it just died.  Not pleased that I now have to buy some new ones and disappointed that these just did not last for even a year.
2	The end that plugs into the device it not at a right angle it stick out and when wearing my phone on my waist the wire is being pulled upward.  Needless to say about 5 weeks after receiving them the wire inside the connector or rater right where it sticks out broke.  Wiggle it just right and I get sound in both earns if not only 1 ear gets sound.  I returned these for credit and bought a pair of Motorola S305 Bluetooth headphones and I could not be happier.  Skip this product you'll thank me later once you did.
0	I sent them back immediately.  One of the channels didn't work consistently and that side also held the microphone so it didn't work either.  Worthless.Five stars for the Amazon return process though--simple easy and quick.
2	First of all I really like these headphones.  Having a remote and mic is now a requirement for all headphones I buy - and these meet the that bar.  They sound great a bit bass heavy but that is fine.  For the price ($20) they are an excellent value.  Now the downside - they are not durable.  Every six months or so they stop working.  I send them back to Maximo and they send me a new pair.  I guess you get what you pay for - but I wish they lasted a bit longer.  If you are willing to go through the hassle Maximo's customer support is great.
2	The armband is hard and is exact fit for my iPhone 3GS. That seems to be a good news; but it makes it quite hard to put iPhone inside and take it out. Would not recommend if you are going to swap your phone in and out frequently. Also once phone is in there is no way to access volume buttons. Only way to control volume is through the screen and that is absolutely not convenient. Overall its good enough for its price; but I wouldn't have mind paying a bit more and getting a better band.
2	It's not bad but it's obviously low quality. The strap doesn't adjust to a wide range of diameters it's mostly for larger arms and not smaller petite women's arms.
2	The price was unbelievable. $0.01 - one penny that's how much the price was plus s&h; total about $3. I don't know why the price was so low but I'm very happy with my purchase!The design is great. When I tighten it around my arm it never moves no matter how fast I am running. It feels very tight and I feel my phone is perfectly secure inside it. This is a high quality product. I almost purchased another one for $25 but I'm glad I tried my luck for this product which sold for one penny.The 3GS screen can be easily accessed when inside it too.I don't have any complaints. It works it looks great it is of great quality the strap is elastic and tightens up really well gets the job done works for what I bought it for.Happy customer!UPDATE: I'm no longer happy with this product. Buy yourself a quality product instead. I drop my rating from 5 to 3. I only bought this because it was $0.01 at the time.
2	Okay for the money very flimsy and cheap materials. I probably would use more for an ipod instead of a phone.
0	This NO is exactly what I was looking for - This NO is exactly what I was looking for -
0	bought one it broke on the 1st use. they sent me a new one for free and that one broke in 2 days.. the suction cup one the device is the problem... i think. idk but i would spend an extra 10 and get a better one from amazon or drop 40 and just go to the apple store and buy it from there.DO NOT BUY
0	I put this on the window and it popped off a few times I think because it was so new and stiff. I wanted to put it in the kitchen while washing dishes and cleaning in general to not only answer the phone but hear my music.. I was a little nervous at first but it now is fine.UP DATE  pops off never got to use it but a couple of times for an hr or so Dont waste money or time on it
2	i would not get this again the windshield mount broke the first day a pain in the butt to put the mount on the air vent. i used it for my htc evo 4g cell not made well
2	I have gone thru a lot of windshield holders for phones/GPS and this was not what I expected. I am rough with my things and this product I had to be careful when I connected my phone.
2	I really love the part of this mount that holds my iPhone. It has adjustable friction (ball and socket) that makes it easy to rotate into landscape format and back. The clamp opens and closes easily and holds the phone securely - even with the phone in a case. The opening at the bottom allows you to easily connect a car charger. The stiff goose neck allows you to place the phone just where you want it.Unfortunately the suction cup is too small and too stiff to support the weight of the phone. I tried a number of different mounting locations on the windshield and tried using the adapter to attach it to the dash but it would always fall off - usually very quickly.Now that I've attached the suction cup to the dashboard with silicon sealant I'm pretty happy with this solution. Unfortunately it's literally stuck there until I decide to remove it permanently.
2	i broke the mount for the air vent right away lol so be careful when u do it don't force it my other issue is that the bottom things don't move so if you want to put ur phone landscape or a GPS is not center on the mount but u can still used it
0	The case looked great and snapped on tight.  But the minute I snapped it on I realized that I needed to remove the microSD card from the phone copy some files on it and put it back.  It is nearly impossible to remove the card from Centro without removing the battery cover first (what clever engineer at Palm thought THAT would be a good idea?!?!? definitely not a usability expert).  So... hmmm.... yeah... eventually couple of days later a fearless friend of mine pried it open with his extremely sharp almost surgical quality blade.  He did not break it but said that the case will not survive if I had to open it on a regular basis.  So - its a great case if you never need to open the battery cover.  If you do need to open it - look for a different case.
0	This is basically a very cheap plastic case.. if you want to be cheap... go for it. The case always unsnaps itself randomly for no good reason. You have to somehow put it on just the right amount to get it not to unsnap. However you still can easily unsnap the case off and I'm just glad the phone hasn't fallen out yet. The swivel clip is also very very hard to press down and take out the phone... You are going to have to have your fingers pushing on both ends of the clip in order to get the phone out of the clip. This is annoying when trying to answer a call or trying to get to a text message. The only pro about this product is that it's cheap.
0	Should have read he reviews would have not bought it
2	its a circular disk that your plantronics blue tooth fits in and the reason i only give it 3 stars is that there is no integrated power to this docking station.  you have to take the charger that came with the bluetooth and stick it in the bottom for it to plug into so there is no extra charger with this docking station.
0	This item was recommended as a piggyback purchase when I purchased a Plantronics Voyager Pro+ bluetooth headset.  It was advertised as a desktop charging stand for the headset.  Apparently it's a base for the Voyager 510 charger (the old first Voyager that Plantronics introduced which I owned light-years ago in technology time).  The Pro+ fits awkwardly in it (tight fit) and the base does not come with a charger (although the picture shows a cord attached to it).  It's just a desktop weight and the Voyager Pro+'s charger does not fit.  When you jam it in there the base does not sit flat and rolls around on the desk.  It does not stand vertically.  In sum it's a rather expensive paperweight that advertises Plantronics.  Thanks for nothing and i hope it helps some of you save your money.
2	As the other reviewers stated this is literally just a stand.  There is no charging capabilities with this stand.  All you get is the round disc that holds your plantronics voyager pro headest upright.  I personally don't care whether my headset is laying flat on my counter or standing up.  If you would like your headset to be standing up all nice and pretty than buy this stand if not save your money any purchase an additional charger for your headset.
0	This product is a bad joke!  It isn't a charging stand at all!  It is simply a plastic disc that is supposed to fit and hold the earpiece.  I can't make it function as described and I am a mechanical engineer!  It did not come with any instructions at all.  It arrived in a simple clear plastic bad with nothing else.  I rate this at as a total waste of my money!
0	CAUTION:  To get an entire product usable on your device you are likely to have to deal with TWO maybe MORE separate vendors shipments multiple shipping charges and hard to find specs on what tip fits what Exactly which devices.  NO ONE cares enough to really help you out.  Returns of some part(s) are likely and add more to cost and to your wait for a fully functional product.  It is NOT the product it is the AMAZON and SUB-VENDOR system that creates a mess.I would avoid this product like poison!
2	Worth it if you want micro usb devices chargeRecommendedIf anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
2	I am sad to say this product only does half of what I was told it would do. Unless mine is just messed up it charges with a USB cable to your computer but does not sync. Also is also another minor problem...there are no 2 color LEDs to show charging or fully charged. The front LED is white and stays that way as long as it is plugged in no matter if the phone is in the cradle or out of the cradle as well as if it is charging or fully charged. (I thought that this might be because I was charging using the USB cable so I tried the plug and still white). Overall it looks good but the 3 stars are because it doesn't sync which even on the BB site it says it will do.
2	I absolutely LOVE this a docking station with one small issue (which is why the 3-star rating). The USB cable worked for a couple months but the data cable suddenly quit working probably just a faulty crimp in one of the connectors. I had another cable so it wasn't a big deal but it still should work.  On the other hand for the price and that being the only issue i would still recommend the purchase if you have a Blackberry Pearl.~j
2	I ordered this product to replace a post that had broken on the back of my phone case.What arrived was NOT what was pictured here.  Instead it was a different version with base plates shaped completely differently.I was able to attach the post with generous application of superglue but it wasn't what I expected.
0	Broke within minutes of me attaching it to my phone and clipping it to wat waistband. Do not waste your money.
2	IT BROKE AFTER THE SECOND TIME THAT I USED IT AND I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT UNTIL NOW ALSO DID NOT WORK FOR WHAT I WAS USING IT FOR
2	I had high expectation for this headphone since I owned one Etymotic before and liked it. Once I got it I put it on my phone and the plug didn't work properly. The headphone kept disconnecting and reconnecting back with phone while I was walking my dog. First I thought it might be my phone since it is about two years old. So I put it on my boyfriend's phone (Galaxy SIII) and magic happened... The headpone doesn't fit in completely and I had to push it to get connected. So disappointed and returning it waiting for UPS pick-up.
2	I tried these but decided to go with a Klipsch model instead because it had volume controls.The sound is great with lots of isolation. However it may be too much isolation for use in a car.The cord rarely tangles!
2	I have to say I'm shocked at all the extremely positive reviews here I can't be the only person who thinks these are over-rated and over-priced?I'll start by saying I'm far from an audiophile (that would be my husband) but I am madly in love with my ipod touch. I use it very little for music but extensively for watching movies shows etc. The stock earbuds are pretty awful as we all know besides medicore sound quality they are just so uncomfortable so I was on the look out for something more comfortable for myself and something with great sound for my husband who uses his ipod touch every day on his 1 1/2 hour commute to/from NYC.What we ended up with was a pair of these and a pair of the vmoda'sV-MODA Vibe Earbuds - Gunmetal Blackwhich retail for about $100 less.I had already decided these would be mine as I said he's the audiophile but strangely doesn't mind the stock earbuds and didn't care what he ended up with. I was so excited when they arrived I had already tried out the vmoda's and really really liked them and assumed with the $100 price difference these would be that much better.Love ended quickly I thought it was to difficult to put them in my ears (pull your ear up and out with one hand twist in with the other) sure it blocked out the outside sound but in a head underwater in the bathtub manner the sound wasn't clear and true but muffled to me and no bass... just none. I tried all the different size fittings tried putting them in different ways (yes I tried a very deep tight fitting still awful) tried different songs. I was in disbelief so I grabbed hubby and made him try them vs the vmodas he agreed instantly that the vmodas were infinitely better. I did find if I gently (not pushing so much as just barely touching) held my finger tips to them when they were in that the sound was much better but I'm not going to use them with my index fingers in my ears. Maybe I got a bad pair maybe my ears just work better with the vmoda... whatever the reason I wasn't impressed with these and feel that the $100 you'd save by getting the vmoda's could be applied to a new ipod or lots more music from itunes.I didn't have the chance to try them out as a phone as I don't have an iphone and I'm not sure if the double click to advance songs only works on an iphone it didn't work on my ipod touch (would have been a very nice feature if it did).The case these come with is nice though for what that's worth.
2	Let me first of all state I have REALLY small ear canals. So I will endeavor to only mention that even the smallest isolation baffles Etymotic Research sent with the headphones hurt like all heck.The sound they produce is actually quite good (once I figured out they basically have to be way INSIDE your ears). The mic isn't the best I've ever seen. It is very subject to wind noise (I walk a lot). And there is a strange whistling/humming that accompanies the wind noise.They're not horrible but if I'd purchased them ($179) I'd be returning them since I only used them for five days. They are superb if I am in a noisy environment and I want to LISTEN to stuff. But if I'm in a noisy place and want to be heard forgettaboutit.And another thing. The case they sent with mine is very chincy. The nylon zipper blew out and so the case is basically useless. Pretty poor for a high end device.Five stars for great sound. One off for wind noise one off for cruddy bag design. If you've experienced pain with other in-ear headphones you might want to avoid these. They're small but they're just not small enough for me.
2	I have been a religious advocate of Etymotic canalphones since the original ER6 came out and I've been using a set of ER6i's for 3 or 4 years now.First the good: The HF2's are clearly superior to the ER6i's with a mellower less shrill topend while still managing to retain crisp definition and equal or exceed the bass of the ER6i.  The HF2 still doesn't have the base of a Shure or Ultimate Ear but overall I prefer the Etymotic sound.Then the not so good: Sadly at least on my BlackBerry the microphone is terrible.  It simultaneously has low gain yet no sound isolation.  The people I call tell me that I'm muffled and hard to understand and I have to speak loudly to be heard even if I'm in a quiet location.  Forget being able to talk on these in the car or at an airport or when walking outside.  The people I call can only hear rushing wind or background noise.Another flaw is that the microphone hole is tough to get located near the mouth.  I find that I have to hold the mic up near my mouth and make sure it isn't twisted to point away.Then the terrible: I sent an email to Etymotic expressing my disappointment with the mic and asking if there was a chance that I had a bad microphone.  They never responded to my email.  I will try again but so far I'm pretty disillusioned with the HF2.  I suppose I'll have to call them and try to get an RMA (I let the return period with Amazon expire.)
2	This item comes with two multiply plastic sheets a 'squeegee' (small piece of plastic) and a dry wipe. The instructions are clear - on each protector are two tabs with 'step 1' and 'step 2' on either side of them. Clean your Voyager's screens choose the correct protector for external/internal and peel off 'step 1'. Apply it to your phone then squeegee off any air bubbles. Finally remove the outer layer 'step 2' and you're done!I did the external screen with ease and the effect is invisible and does not interfere with the functionality of the touch screen. The inside however was a nightmare as the 'step 2' tab is placed exactly where the hinge area is as another reviewer noted. This made it practically impossible to apply the internal screen protector. In fact I gave up after I accidentally smudged the protector - once you've done that it's over.So the all-important exposed external screen is done and I'm happy but this product has a strangely thoughtless design on the internal one. So 3 out of 5 for getting it all half right I guess.As a footnote initially I was scared I'd been sent a damaged product as there were scratches already all over both screens but that's actually just the screen protector's outer layer which gets discarded.
2	This holster is functional but as other reviewers noted it's not built to last. My own broke after 3-4 months and had to be replaced. I've been using theBlackBerry Leather Swivel Holster for BlackBerry Curve 8300 8310 8320 8330 (Pitch Black)ever since for about 2 years and this one has held my Blackberry at my waist almost every day. In all this time it did not break and my Blackberry did not drop or got scratched.I like the following about this holster:- designed to wrap around the Blackberry and not let it go unless pulled by owner- clip attaches easily and safely to belt of almost any size but I use it with jeans without a belt- very strong magnetic lock- swivel rotes about 180 degrees (you force it to rotate more and yes it WILL break)- 'free' sides make it very easy to take it out quickly when needed- designed to adapt itself to be used by several models- good looks- genuine black leather- reasonably pricedWhat I don't like and what makes all of the above irrelevant:- it falls apart after a few monthsGiven the durability issue this may be okay for 'casual' and very careful users but I don't know too many casual BB users :). I will give it 3 stars which means it's Okay on the Amazon scale. It's not a disaster or an obvious rip-off but there are better alternatives.
2	(Using with iPhones)  I discontinued my home phone service and my wife and I just were using our cell phones.  I then heard about this type of technology that connected your home land phones with your cell phone.  Figured I would give it a try.  AWESOME!  Just unplug your land phone line from the wall and plug it into this bluetooth.  Turn your cell phone bluetooth on discoverable mode.  It connects to the Xlink easily and you're ready to go!  I read that you want the other version - the N version if you want to continue to use a land line phone service at the same time.  The only limitation of this unit the bluetooth technology.  All bluetooth devices need to be in a decent range of each other to connect.  My Xlink is in my kitchen.  I start to get a crackle on the line if the phone is ~30 feet away in my bedroom.  But anywhere within ~20 feet the line is clear.  Thus I simply leave my phone in this general area.  When I want to make a call I pick up any of the cordless phones I have that are connected to the base (there are 4) and I simply dial.  The phone uses the cell every time and makes the call.  When receiving a call the cordless phone displays the caller ID without any problems.  This thing is GREAT.  Definitely no need for my regular phone service now...**** UPDATE **** UPDATE... WELL after 6 months of use my opinion on this has changed.  My review above still is valid... It links up just fine with your bluetooth enabled phone as I described and once linked it works fine.  BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM... Imagine that you're relaxing by the TV and a phone call come in on your cell phone.  So you pick up YOUR CELL and answer and start talking.  30 seconds (or other random time) into your conversation you realize that you cannot hear the other person now!  You look down and see that the phone is now connected to the Xlink.  You hopefully switch back quick enough before the person on the line gets upset and hangs up...OR you're coming home from work while talking on your cell phone and pull into the garage... and then the Xlink connects and you no longer have the conversation going on your cell.  You may be able to click over but sometimes you don't realize that it has if you are the one talking.Well this happened to myself and my wife so many times that we eventually gave up and just TURNED THIS THING OFF.  I tried to keep using this for a while... but it became too frustrating!!!  I'm too far out of the return period... I wish I would have returned it when I could have.OVERALL IT'S A GREAT CONCEPT AND MAY WORK WELL AT TIMES BUT IT WILL BECOME FRUSTRATING FOR YOU IF YOU STILL PLAN TO USE YOUR CELL PHONE FOR A PORTION OF THE TIME.  IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS... YOU'LL LIKELY NEED TO SIMPLY PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN NEAR THE XLINK AND *ONLY USE YOUR HOME PHONES*.  Unfortunately my initial smart investment has failed and I'm out of luck.  BUT luckily I found a good alternative!  I use OBI and google voice for my home phone now... works great!OBi110 Voice Service Bridge and VoIP Telephone AdapterIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME FEEL FREE TO LEAVE A REPLY TO THIS REVIEW AND I'LL GLADLY ANSWER!  HOPEFULLY MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN HELPFUL FOR YOU!
2	I used it to attach to my house phone wiring even though I don't have a land line.  It was easy to setup the by plugging a telephone cable into the box and into the house wall plate.  Bluetooth was easy to connect to my phones.  However only one of my phones worked well with the system allowing me to answer and make calls thru my land line phones.  Using the land line phones key pad to respond to destination menus would not work occasionally.
2	I'm quite interested in antiques. So i purchased myself a rotary phone. Problem is i don't have a wired phone line that supports rotary phone pulse dialing. I tried getting a magic jack but of course that doesn't support pulse dialing either. So i eventually bought this. If you want to use a rotary dial phone this is a great thing to have. I connect Xlink to my cellphone and use the rotary phone to call it. I use the rotary dial to input the number i want to call and my cell phone connected by bluetooth recieves those numbers from Xlink and begins to call. at that point it works like any other rotary dial phone. When you hang up it hangs up on the cell phone as well. I've only got a few complaints regarding this product.Pros:-Great if you have a rotary dial phone and only cell phone service available. Or if your phone company doesn't support pulse dialing.Cons:- Poor quality. it's not horrendous it's manageable. Just irritating to have a small bit of distortion in the phone line. Might be the phone or the bluetooth connection hard to tell since i've never used this phone on an actual phone line before.- Irritating blinking light. I keep this in my room and i like to keep it on so that if someone calls me i can hear the phone ringing. Unfortunately that blinking light irritates the crap out of me when i'm trying to sleep. so i usually end up turning it off which is unfortunate.
2	I've replaced this a few times from different sources and I don't find these rings go on properly. I've had others try as well and they couldn't get it to fit right either.
0	ask for more money for express shipping and it takes longer than regular mail.  It took almost two weeks to receive item.  I wrote to seller and seller never contacted me.
2	The Motorola Motofone F3 is a basic no-fills cell phone that's unique for it's usage of an e-ink display (same technology used in ebook readers like the Nook or Kindle). The benefits of having this type of display is that it uses less power looks like printed text on paper (readable under direct sunlight) and offers extensive durability. For these reasons- the F3 has been labeled by some as the &#34;Zombie Accomplice Emergency Phone&#34;.However in practice- I found that e-ink (the biggest selling point of the F3) can also be a hindrance. For example to refresh the display for menus /text messages there is a notable lag and a 'flicker' (used to wipe the screen and create the new image) - which can slow users down. Also I found the battery life to be quite disappointing. Seeing that the phone had an e-ink screen no camera no Bluetooth no games (only for calling and MMS)...- I was surprised to find the phone to only last roughly 4-5 days under moderate usage.Call quality itself is quite good and the reception with T-Mobile's 2G network is more than acceptable.Note that this is a dual band (not quad band) phone which means some countries may not support the device. Reception and battery info. are both smartly displayed on the upper region of the display (next to the earpiece to both sides). What's not so smart though is the UI. It's slightly clunky and takes some time to learn all the icons and tricks. There's also no volume rocker so changing the sound mid-call is more tedious than on normal phones.Otherwise the backlight is readable in the dark and the keypad is large/tactile to press. The phone is also quite lightweight and slim- making it easy to carry along with you. Again in therms of aesthetic appeal this is definitely a very eye-catching design despite being made out of plastic.Overall the low price tag (under $30 UNlocked) cutting-edge look cool e-ink screen and good call quality compensate for the disappointing battery life and lack of more features. If you do want a basic (or emergency back-up phone) with plenty of style- go for it! Just note it's shortcomings as well...
0	This phone was so basic it was little more than a thin calculator. The manual was all in Spanish and some of the menu options on the phone itself were too. Couldn't distinguish between lower and uppercase and just a general dirt-cheap phone. Would never recommend to anyone.
0	Mine lasted 4 days before the screen quit.  There is a reason these are sold with no warranty!  I wasted $40 on one.
0	This battery never worked. Would not hold a charge. I left it plugged in over night and the battery never charged up.
0	I really wanted this to work but it never charged my phone for more than 2 minutes. Don't buy it.
0	I used this once. Now it doesnt see the charger unless I push it in hard - and when I do or use a different charger it never charges. Now its for the landfill.
0	I bought this hoping many of the stellar reviews would trump the many poor reviews but unfortunately it turned out to not be the case for me.I ordered the item to be able to charge my new AT&T; Inspire 4G by HTC. It's a battery hog so having a portable recharge would be great.I opened the box and was really excited because the product is sexi to look at... it's not one of the dark black boxy electronics you usually associate with this type of product. It's curvy and nice looking.Initial read of the instructions proved to be a challenge as it's clearly a manual that was written in Chinese and then translated and converted to english for North American sale. It was a bit contradictory and vague in a couple aspects so I went online and watched the how-to just so I could say with certainty I was using it properly.I charged it initially for 24 hours (it recommends 4-6 hours) and the instruction manual that came with it said one light will flash when it was completed charging. After 24 hours TWO lights were still charging. I went onto their website and it states that when charging is complete the light should remain on and solid. However this was not the case for me.I decided based on the specs 24 hours should have been more than enough to charge it (by technological spec 5 hours from complete drain to full charge is all it should take). I plugged in my device and immediately all 4 lights lit up on the battery pack indicating full capacity. After 5 minutes it dropped to 3 then after 10 minutes it went to 2...At this point I contacted the manufacturer. They were quick to respond that it's likely defective. I questioned if they see this a lot and they said yes. I asked why they don't resolve it and they said (in broken english) that it was what people expect for half the price of the competition. Seems a bit odd of a response from them. To me I'd want to put out the best (usable) product for the price or not put out a product but hey whatever.BOTTOM  LINE: Amazon is issuing me a refund as I'm sending this one back. Normally I'd give the benefit of the doubt and re-order another one but given the less than impressive response from the manufacturer I'm planning on returning for a refund.  I'm going to order the Zagg Sparq 2.0 which gets great reviews. At almost 2x the price I'll have to suck it up and pay for it but I suppose if I want a product that comes with warranty and support that's the cost of it. I also learned that Amazon doesn't have a lot of flexibility in their marketplace seller practices so they said their hands are tied. I'll stick to ordering direct from Amazon going forward.  :-(
0	Unpacked it and plugged it into a charger. The second third and fourth LED's lit up. Seemed to be charging OK and external LED and laser light worked fine.After about 30 seconds all the LED's went out the power button did nothing no matter how many time or how long it was pressed and unit is totally dead.Back it goes. So glad I spent the extra $4 so I would have it in time for a weekend trip.
2	Yes...this battery does connect to my ipad and my verizon mifi...however...it's an advertising stretch to say it charges them in the same way the factory chargers do...  Since there are no tech specs I would guess this is only a 1amp battery...  It will charge ipod and droidx ok...
0	Gt the product for free basically purchased the larger charger and received this guy as a free gift. Well it's junk. Device doesn't charge. When plugged in the charge lights come up for a few seconds indicating its charging than the unit shuts down. Like many other posters mine probably is defective. Anyhow my advice is to avoid.
0	This charger is simply the best. I use it with my iPhone 5 and it works flawlessly. I'm getting almost 3 charges before the iTorch needs to be recharged. Never again will I worry about being stranded with a dead phone. Don't hesitate to buy one!UPDATE 4/7/13 - Unfortunately I spoke too soon. In my enthusiasm I purchased a second charger shortly thereafter and that unit was DOA (would not turn on after a full charge). Since I still had faith in New Trent I ordered a third charger and this one was also DOA. In all only 1 out of 3 chargers performed as expected. Very disappointed.
2	I have had the itorch for almost two weeks now and have used it quite a bit.  So here are the pros.... 1.  It works on all my products that use the micro usb connector (Droid X Galaxy S 3 Kindle Fire)  2.  I can get several charges out of my itorch for my smart phone.  3.  It charges my smart phone pretty quickly seems about the same speed as the wall charger.  4.  I can charge my itorch with the wall plug or with a USB car charger adapter.  Which I do often.  I seem to forget to charge it at home and instead charge while I am on my way.Cons- 1.  The itorch itself takes what seems like a long time for itself to charge.  2.  It seems a little thick.  I think I would have liked it to be larger in length and width if it could be thinner in size more like a smart phone.Verdict- Despite the cons I give it 5 stars.  I take my itorch with me everywhere.  I can't afford to be without my phone for work.  And with my itorch my phone won't go dead.  Updated- 4-21-13.  After having this device for a few months it just quit on me.  I have used it probably 20 times.  I will call the company and see what they can tell me.UPDATE:  Contacted New Trent Service and the item was replaced.  So far the replacement is working great!
0	The product works just as advertised charging my iPhone to full a few times on one charge. Really gives me peace of mind toward the end of the day.UPDATE February 2014: Broke after 5 months of use.
2	I chose this because this has flash light and laser point. I guess they will be useful in daily life but...1. 5200mah capability is good. ( one iphone and extra device..but not full 2 devices at one time)2. holding phone and this item..is not comfortable. ( not recommeded things thoud)3. And compared to other 5200 mah batter pack i think this does not have full competency. I do not have scientific data to prove this. Based on recharging process i felt many times.
2	When I went to use this the fist time it was dead.  I think it can accidentally turn on in your bag if the button gets pressed.  Also I just upgraded from iPhone to an android where I can simply change the freakin battery pack.  IMHO don't waste your money on this for your puny iPhone.  Get an android with replaceable batteries and universal microSD charger and a man-sized screen.
2	I am adding this paragraph after owning this battery for about 8 months: The battery started not turning on (either as a flashlight or as a power source) even though it has plenty of charge left.  You can wake it up by plugging it into a charger momentarily. Then it will work again until it stops again. I took a video of the battery not working then plugging it in for one second and then showing it working again. I will try to get an answer from the company.  Stay tuned.  I have dropped my rating to 3 stars in the mean time.My iPhone 3Gs needed a new battery.  I researched all the options and videos about how to replace it and decided that this product would satisfy my needs for now.  My internal battery lasts about 4 hours and then I have to plug this in to recharge it.  My battery has such little reserve that this product charges it in less than an hour.  Typically I don't even have to use the phone during this time but if I do the cord is no problem to have connected.  I can charge my phone at least 3 times before I have to recharge this product.One peculiarity is that you can't charge the unit with a 30-pin (or Lightning) cord.  You must use the micro-USB cord supplied (or another one like it) and charge from any standard USB jack (computer or brick that you would use to charge the iPhone or iPod).  The reason is that the manufacturer would have had to pay license fees to Apple to use that jack so instead they have one micro-USB jack to charge it from (power in) and another standard USB to connect to your phone (power out).  This doesn't bother me and it probably knocked a dollar off the price.  But you do have to have that other connector handy to recharge this battery.Others complained that the unit wouldn't charge up fully.  I find that it will charge fine if you fully cycle it.  I don't recharge it when it's only partly discharged.  It has 4 status lights and I wait until only one light is showing to recharge it.  The unit will turn itself off after 30 seconds of no load or you can turn it off manually after checking the status.  I have not tried to both charge it and use it at the same time which some dongle-type external batteries encourage you to do but it would be an awkward mess to have both cords attached.  This is definitely for your pocket not for holding or attaching to your phone.
0	After a couple of months of use battery wont charge what a waste of money . . I think its waste of money to buy a charger that only last 3months .
2	If you had asked me 3 months ago I would've rated this 5 stars. However in the last month the device doesn't charge. I've had it look like it was charging with the lights going but then no actual charge. Or it just doesn't do anything no matter what charger I plug it into. This is really disappointing because I only bought it 5 months ago.Prior to that it had been working great. I could easily get 2.5 full charges of my iPhone 5. It was perfect for travel. I could use it all day charge it overnight and it was ready to go again the next day.
0	I really loved this when I first got it. It charged well and the battery lasted a long time. When I went to charge it a second time it would not charge. I do not know if mine was just defective or what but I had to return mine.
2	I got this for someone that had needed a mid-day mobile charging solution. However it is too bulky to fit in the small purse she carries so now it sits mostly unused in her car. The price was decent but it is just a bit too big for ladies' small handbags. Later I purchased a lipstick sized 2600mAh battery that does fit her intended use.EDIT: Now there are Batteries this size with much more capacity thanks to advancements in battery technology.
2	held good charge and would charge my phone 2 full cycles however after 3 months and outside of the return period it died...
2	It lasted only 11 months of very light usage.It is also easy to depress the button by accident while in the bag and ended up turning on the laser for a long period of time unintentionally.
0	The product arrived and I read the instructions and charged the battery for the recommended time. Product did not work It had no charge.  I charged it again andthen same issue.  I was only offered a refund and not a replacement.  The product in my book is suspect.  Be advised that you may have to go through multiple purchases and shippings in order to receive a functional device.
2	Nice device. Fits in my pocket. Charges my smartphones powers my usb lights and fans.But it needs improvement.It does not stop charging. It just shows that its full and continues to charge. Has anyone had it stop charging when full? Or does it just overcharge?
2	I wanted to love this case but I just didn't. The build quality was mediocre it had sharp seams on the edges that kinda hurt my hand and I had to whittle them down with an x-acto blade. Also the back is textured which you would think would be a grip improvement over the naked aluminum (most of the reason I want a case to begin with) but the texture actually makes it slicker and harder to hold than the naked unit. Since then I've picked up a Power Support Air Jacket and really like that better... it's much more expensive but worth it over this second-rate case.
2	I bought two of these. One for the Palm centro from sprint and the LG rumor from sprint also. The pouch fits the LG rumor very well with a little room to move. But the Palm fits alright with some room to move. Recommend for LG Rumor and for palm if you can't find a better case. Case is very well made overall.
0	I would not bother on this model.  Tried them out for a day or two and they sounded like muffled waffles that had too much syrup poured on them!Bluetooth connected and disconnected randomly.  Sound was not solid but tinny.Get the Sound Matters speakers I reviewed today if you want a good solid pair of speakers that will work and last a long time.Sorry Altec but you blew it on this one!
2	I was looking forward to a great sounding speaker since I like the Altec Lansing brand. It sounds just okay. I was a little disappointed. I recently hear the JBL brand they sell at the Verizon store and it sounded way better. I guess you get what you pay for.
2	Not sure i can suggest this as it is large and I only wore it once or twice then gave up!
0	Oh it fits the iPhone with Mophie Plus case -- perfectly!  But in barely 2 weeks....the clip has already torn from the case and I NEARLY LOST my iPhone 4S and Mophie Air case it was barely hanging by a few threads.  If I could give it negative stars for the lack of security this case offered I would.So....not a good investment....find something ELSE!What else can I say....?
0	The plastic clip on the first one broke about Day 2.  I figured it was just a manufacturer's defect so I contacted the seller and was quickly shipped a replacement - no questions asked.  Interestingly the replacement had a metal belt clip.  It lasted about a month before finally tearing out from the poorly secured and flimsy leather phone pouch.Don't waste your money.  There are good products which will fit a large phone (iphone4 with Mophie Juice.)
0	It looks like top button is exposed in pics.  Not the case and this will ruin your iphone.  I had 2/4 iphone 4s where the top botton stopped working because you have to press so hard.
2	Easily fits the iphone 5 and the appearance looks good too. However that's about it no additional functionality. It's just average rating for me. It's ok for the price.
2	the audio has static and you cant really get a good listening experience with this adapter. which might be expected. i used with an old phone just for music but it didn't work out. i've since thrown it out. both phone and adapter.
2	product works but after 2 days the wires are exposed..i give it another few weeks before its completely damaged and i take very good care of it.
2	for everyone who is searching over and over again on amazon trying to find a headphone adapter for their HTC etc phones read this.there are basically four options.1+2. there is this adapter and there is the one that is straight instead of right-angled. they are shipped interchangeably.3. the HTC oem 3-1 adapter. this is the one with the 3 and 2.5mm mini-USB and power ports.4. the HTC oem mic+headphone adapter. locally my t-mobile store carries this one.i own all of these.3 is probably the best quality but it's very large and bulky. that fact will probably mean you will stress it more often and it will not last not to mention being a pain in the *** in the meantime. this one is good for the desk but not for carrying around.4 adds around 5 feet of cable to your headphones. a worse pain than option 3. you do get a working mic though.this item option 1+2 are the lightest weight and smallest. the problem is that they are complete junk. unfortunately this is really the only reasonable option. so buy 2 and expect them to last somewhere between 0 and 90 days. i've owned 3: one lasted less than a day one lasted 2 weeks and another lasted 3 months under what i'd term heavy use.
0	Well you get what you pay for sometimes. I wanted to believe this adapter was going to solve my headphone jack problems but alas ten minutes into my workout it had fallen completely apart and the wires had detached.
2	works as it should pretty good sound quality.  Don't like the ear clip thingies as they are too fragile.  Broke one in my pocket.
2	First I have to say I own an iphone 3g with the latest 3.0 firmware. so all my comments refer to usage with this phone.The good part is as a mono headset this is an excellent product. The sound is loud and clear. I have had no complaints from the listener on the other end. Just remember to pull out the boom when you answer the phone. It is well worth the $35 price on that alone.That's probably not why you are buying this product.As a stereo bluetooth?The sound quality is just ok. Slightly better than the stock headphones but louder.  Descent stereo separation. Sounds like a duel bluetooth headset. It is barely Mid-Fi.  OK for listening to music. Just OK.Forget about watching movies or You Tube. There is a few 10ths of a second lag that makes every one seem like they are in a badly dubbed Bruce lee movie. This may have to do with the apple o.s. than the headset its self.The 3gs may do better.When in the stereo mode the mic is about 10db down or half the volume so when you answer a call every one will complain about how low your voice is until you disconnect the other speaker.I have heard skipping once when playing a video.To take full advantage of these headphones I believe you need just a little more processing power than the iphone 3g. I will stick with a wired connection for my movie watching and music listening. The next upgrade on firmware from apple my yield better results.With my iphone 3g bluetooth stereo with this headset is a definite no.
2	I recently purchased this product after reading all reviews to pair with my new iphone 3gs. I wanted to use for listening to podcasts and music as well as the telephone functions. I was disappointed in the thin sound quality the difficulty in getting a decent fit the lack of a pause function for my podcasts and music and lastly the constant on and off performance during listening. I never used it away from my phone to make sure there were no distance issues.  I had some difficulty in operating the sync on and off functions and getting in and out of my car caused it to fight with my built in car bluetooth. The unit is light inexpensive at 35-40.00 and has decent build quality. Lack of a pause function is a deal breaker as well as the constant stopping and starting while listening to content. It was unusable so I had no choice and had to return to store. I wanted to like it because of the price and weight. I read the manual completely and am an experienced user of tech. Phone function worked well.
2	Buyers Beware....The battery depicted adjacent to the item description is NOT the battery I received for my v3M. I received an older first generation Motorola battery for the v3M which has a black casing. Although the battery is compatible and appears to be functioning satisfactorily at this point it was clearly NOT the item represented on the website. The second generation (newer) Motorola batteries for the v3M contain black graphics on a white background-as pictured on the website. This is deceptive and somewhat misrepresentational. My suggestion is to check and verify by contacting the merchant prior to purchasing the item.  The term new simply implies that the item has not been used and has nothing to do with how long the item has been stored or inventoried.  Remember...  Batteries lose capacity the longer that they have been stored. Always get the latest generation/version and check the date/production codes if at all possible.  These are usually embossed on the casing of the cell.  Refuse to purchase from a vendor who does not or will not furnish you with this information-it is critical in insuring that you are receiving fresh merchandise.
2	I loved all the features of my N95 although the screen was really too small for internet browsing.  Then after only a few months of normal use my Nokia N95 began having video problems.  The video would go dark or display upside down and backwards or show half the screen and half snow with the visible half reversed. It would fail for a few hours then magically resume normal operation. Sometimes powering it down repeatedly would bring it back to life but without a screen it's very difficult to operate.  Warranty repairs with shipping equaled the cost of a new iPhone.  Never again will I spend so much money for a phone with moving parts.
2	This charger obviously doesn't put out much current because it will hardly raise the battery level on my phone after several hours of charging time (Nokia 5800 XM). On top of that it won't even work on my PSPgo. Not very useful at all. I suppose in an emergency it will give me some power for my phone so I'll give it 2 stars for that but I really can't recommend it.EDIT: I have discovered that the supplied USB cable was partially at fault for the low output. Using a Nokia USB charge cable I get a useful charge rate. Still not a fast charge but fast enough that I can use the phone while charging it. With the supplied cable the charge rate was so low that if the phone was not in standby (or off) it would not gain any charge at all and might even continue to drain. Crap cable toss it! With proper cables I have used this successfully on a few devices now. Still giving it 2 stars though for including the crappy USB cable.
0	First it wouldnt even charge my Motorola Cliq XT but that couldbe because of the phone. Then it wouldn't even turn on after one week.
0	does not work on ipod touch 4g dont know of its cause it was broken already out the box LEDs dont work what is this?! garbage dont buy guys
2	I tried to charge my smartphone with this device and it melted! There is apparently no power regulation built in. Modern smartphones and tablet computers can draw 1000mah or more and that just cooks this charger. It may be OK for ipods or bluetooth headsets but don't use it for any power hungry device.
0	It doesn't charge my AA batteries in the case and it actually drains the battery of any device connected to it. Actually to be fair it charges the device for about 10 minutes then the flow seems to reverse and it exhausts the battery of the device it's supposed to be charging. I threw it in the recycling bin.
2	I haven't had this very long but so far it's great.  I put four fully-charged eneloop batteries in it and was able to charge up my iPhone to 100% in less than an hour and the Tekkeon still seems to have plenty of juice.  You can charge the AA batteries while they are inside the unit so once they are in there you never need to take them out.  Good price well build device comes with a little cloth drawstring bag for carrying around in your laptop bag purse or backpack.  Highly recommended for people with smartphones that drain their batteries in a day.EDIT:  Changed this to a 2-star review from a 5-star.  The device has developed a strange metallic smell; this cannot be a good thing.  Also the amount of charge that I can get from fresh batteries has dropped significantly.  I'm afraid to use the device for fear of starting a fire or leaking battery acid everywhere...
0	Bought this with eneloop AA rechargable batterys..I began to charge/play my Video Mp3 player..Within 5 to 10 mins I picked up the charger..The charger was stove hot smelling and melting..To think that I was just about to leave the room for a while....Scary situation..Why make these things out of thin plastic material?Dangerous......
0	I was researching ways to boost cell signals when I found this. After reading many reviews I realized that the issue of weak cell signals can be fixed easily and permanently with a cell phone that can use WIFI to make receive calls text and data. A weak cell signal is a common problem with concrete and metal buildings shielding those signals out.  And many live in areas where cell signals are just weak.  But we always have access to WIFI at home or in the office. Republic Wireless solved this problem over two years ago. It uses VOIP calling backed up by both Sprint Cell and Verizon roaming. It also works world wide on WIFI for $5 a month. Service is unlimited and has no contract. An unlimited call and text plan is $10 a month and unlimited cell text and data is $25 a month. You do have to use their phone (Moto X $299 or Moto G $149) because they need Republic's proprietary software to work at these rates. I have been using them for over 18 months now and it has worked perfectly.
0	Does not work to boost cell signal in a basement.  Had to exchange for large office and omni directional antenna.  As expected Amazon was wonderful exchanging for the better model and shipped it right away.  Returns and exchanges are so easy with Amazon so I never fear oredering because they always make it right.
2	The cell phone service in my place isn't too bad.  It's about what you'd expect - you look at your cell phone and see that you have a full signal but as soon as you place a call or go online it drops to 1 or 2 bars.I was hoping this thing could fix that - or at least give me a stronger signal.I set it up as best I could - I live in a condo - but saw no difference in cell phone signal strength before and after plugging this thing in.  As I am in a condo I could only put the receiver up against a window not outside on a pole or something.I saw the video read the instructions but still received no increased signal strength or call clarity by using this product.One odd thing - the receiver says to point a certain side of it towards the cell phone tower.  I want you to look around your area right now - do you see a cell phone tower?  Any idea where one might be?  Yah me neither.I am going to give this to someone else who has much worse cell phone reception in their home than myself and if they have better luck I will update this review.But for now - PASS.
2	The packaging for this indicates the ability to boost signals up to 1500 feet. I purchased this for use in my home and found that it would not work for my application.  I called Wilson Electronics for technical assistance. They were very good at helping me troubleshoot my issues. Ultimately we determined it would not work for me and I returned it.The unit comes with a directional antenna. It would not work for me because there is a large hill between my home and the nearest cell tower 1.7 miles away. The signal bounces into my location and is very weak. This type of situation calls for an omnidirectional antenna.Given the weakness of the signal we determined the amp would not be powerful enough to provide a useful boost. I would need to purchase on many times the cost of this DT to see a usable signal.In addition the useful distance of the small desktop antenna provided with this booster is only useful within a few feet. Ideally it will provide signal within close proximity of your desk for a single room in your home but nowhere near what would be required to provide signal to an entire floor of your home for example. This information came from a very honest and helpful tech support person at Wilson.I returned this unit and have opted not to purchase another since the appropriate booster for my home would cost thousands.
2	The 1st time I used Our Signal Booster it worked great.  Cell phone went from 2 bars to 4 bars for both voice and 3G data (Verizon).  Laptop Verizon AirCard went from about 500 Kbps to 1000 kbps download speeds.  Very nice!However the second time I used it I tried pointing the high power antenna out a window on the opposite side of the house to see if there was a closer cell site.  I followed the directions including making sure the low power antenna was greater than 20 feet away and pointed towards the high power antenna before turning on.  This time it initially showed a green light then a red light and the light faded.  I moved the low power antenna further away from the high power antenna and tried again.  This time the light didn't come on anymore.  I tried moving things to the way everything worked the very 1st time but no light would come on.  It was using power because the low power unit was getting warm.  The coax connection point was also getting  really warm.  But it was no longer boosting the signal (no change in cell phone bars).  It seems to have gone dead!We contacted the company (who seems very nice)and they said they will do a warranty replacement of the amplifier.  We will update with details!I would have given the product 4 stars had it not failed us so quickly.Wilson Electronics 801247 Desktop Cell Phone Signal Booster for Home or Office - For Multiple Usershttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014KOB6Y/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
2	Brought the bars on my phone up to 3 but only within about 10 feet from the product. Did nothing for the rest of the house. I only had 1 bar before  I just wish it covered a bigger area.
2	At my office we all (no matter what carrier) get about 1-2 bars of 1X/Edge. We decided to try this out. We ordered it took it up to the roof (about 25ft up) found the latitude and longitude of the nearest Verizon towers and pointed our GPS and compass at them. We directed the antenna towards the towers. No change whatsoever in the signal strength on Verizon but a noticeable increase for some other services. Called tech support and that didn't help but tech support verified that we set it up correctly.I would love to give this higher stars but I can't justify doing so since it doesn't work here with one of the most predominant carriers in the United States.
2	I have mixed feelings about this device. The installation was simple enough but they should really take 'small home' off the description. This will provide coverage for 1 room only. If you're looking for a boost in 1 room this is great. I needed a bit more coverage for the amount of money paid.
2	I bought this when I switched from AT&T to T-mobile. TM's signal is much weaker and doesn't penetrate my apartment like ATT's does in downtown San Francisco.  The signal is OK pretty much everywhere else so I got this booster for home.  Does it work? Probably if you are willing to drill a hole in your wall run the cable to the roof have a spare outlet and are willing to put up with the extra electricity charge and equipment necessary.  My landlord will not let me drill or install the cable.  I tried putting it in a couple of windows and it didn't improve the signal at all; apparently not high enough.
0	I had to return it because it did not meet my application.  In our home which is 3 stories  it did not boost the cell phone range well.
2	I live in the country and the cell phone service depends upon carrier. Most CDMA carriers will get some reception while GSM is pretty much non-existant.Installing the booster didn't do anything for the GSM phones but it did help a little with the CDMAs.Since we use GSM at our house this isn't going to work for us.
0	When you buy this item are you REALLY expecting to first figure out where the nearest cell phone tower is to your house and in exactly which direction?  Then are you REALLY planning on climbing up on your roof to erect a pole so that this thing can point directly at that cell phone tower?  No like me you're thinking you can stick this to the window and it will increase your reception.  Well it won't. So my suggestion is don't buy it; you just end up returning it the way I did.
2	I got this for my non technically inclined brother so he could get good home cell signal.  I walked him through the install over the phone and he cold not get it working. Next time I visited I spent 4 hours trying to get this to work. He lives in a marginal coverage area but it seemed to always be interfering with itself.  I took it home where I have ok coverage and it did boost the signal marginally.I did get it to work well once I found the direction of the nearest tower and aligned it just right. The issue then was that the supplied cable was so short the booster and repeater were interfering with each other. So I went to radio shack and got a 50' cable and put the receiver in the attic and the repeater in the basement. I got good reception as long as I was within 10' of the repeater. Useless for my brothers needs.Overall I was not impressed. But when I wanted one for 4g I got a Wilson Electronics 815126 Sleek 4G-V Cell Phone Signal Booster - Retail Packaging - Blackhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NQ5NWI/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_hst_38Its only for a single phone or jetpack but it works great!
2	When I first read a review of this product online I was quite impressed...finally an iPod mount that would work.  When I received it and put it together I was disappointed.Allow me to elaborate...Griffin has a good idea here; instead of a goose-neck it uses a ball-and-socket joint-type system of arms to position your iPod touch/iPhone.  The problem here is that you have a limited amount of positions to put your iPod in.Second the suction cup is not as strong as it needs to be; it's a good idea on paper (instead of a snap-down toggle like most mounts it's a screw-down type that should hold the suction cup more securely to the windshield) but the suction cup is very difficult to get to stick to the windshield and you have to really press hard against it while screwing it down and even then it would detach from my windshield at the worst possible moment (driving down the Garden State Parkway at 70 miles an hour).Third it will not work with iPods/iPhones in cases...I don't want to have to remove my iTouch from its case every time I want to take it on the road.Griffin has a decent product here that just has a few problems that prevent it from being a great one.  If they address the suction-cup issue and make a mount that allows for holding an iPod in a case this would be a much better product.
0	Give this one a pass. it worked for a week or two then the suction cup quit sticking. Poorly designed cup tension mechanism and the holder came apart on its own.
2	Like other reviews have said unless you have a windshield that is straight up and down like those in a box truck or jeep the angle will not allow you easy access to you phone it will be angled down towards you dash. I mounted on my dash and it seems to work ok there. I have a iPhone 4s and it does not fit tight in the cradle but tight enough that the phone does not fall out even when going over bumpy gravel roads or around sharp turns my sons 3gs snaps into the cradle very tightly. I had no issues with the suction cup working just wet the clear rubber part that connects to the window or disk and you will get a tight seal. I will now be on the hunt for a replacement cradle that is made for the 4s this one did come with 3 different cradles for different phones just not one for a 4s or 5.I gave it 3 stars because it really does not work for a normal windshield I drive a Dodge Charger and the window slant is not all that much in my husbands Toyota Solara the phone basically faces downwards towards the dash his window slant is much greater than mine.
2	I have to say me and this product have had a love and hate relationship.Let's go over a few things:This product Includes:*The actual mount*Variations for different iDevices (it can fit up to a iPhone 3G)*A free AUX to AUX cord-----Now the review. I have to say I was very pleased with the product for about a few months.I should note the product came in a very generic white cardboard box. Yes cardboard.Then it would refuse to stick to the windshield no matter how many twisting and variety of places I tried. It just wouldn't stick. Some of the components don't feel of high quality. (You get what you pay for)So I had to move on. It was a good run though.If you are like me and are sick of looking for a reliable mount for your iDevice or other electronic please please check out the:iOttie Windshield Dashboard Car Mount Holder for iPhone 4S 4 3GS Samsung Galaxy S3 S2 Epic Touch 4G HTC One X EVO 4G Rhyme DROID RAZR BIONIC INCREDIBLE 2 CHARGE Google BlackBerry Torch LG Revolution GPS Compact Size 360 degree RotatableI have had no problems with this it is very high quality and super easy to install.If you are looking for a very reliable mount this may not be your best option. The iOtiie is only a few bucks more and worth so much more.
2	I'd hoped this would fit my iPhone with an invisible shield (plastic film) on it but it doesn't really work the way I hope.  The bracket is so tight it messes up the corners of the invisible shield this is an entirely personal annoyance that wouldn't affect most people and if it wasn't for this I'd get 4 stars.  Mine came with 3 one more 2 arm section than it's typically pictured with which is nice but length isn't the problem it's that it doesn't articulate (bend) enough.  The ball joints should have more range of movement.  Between that and the fact that the suction cup is a little hard to work if you (like me) want to move it between two cars regularly it loses another star.  Truely I think I'd give it 2.5 if I could.
2	The best feature is that the suction cup is one of the best I've seen.  This is because the amount of vacuum you create is dependent on how much you twist the base.On the other hand the angle you can tilt is very minimum.  It does come with additional arm piece so you can increase the total tilt angle it also makes it a couple inches taller/longer off the base so it sticks out too much. I would like to see Griffin come out with a gooseneck using the same suction base so it'll give me more flexible bending option.Finally the holder is very tight.  It does keep iPhone from easily coming loose but if you have a protector film like InvisibleShield (like I do) then you won't be able to put your iPhone on.  I ended up mounting on my desk at home (it's a real office furniture with cherry wood with glassy polish) and I rest my iPhone 3GS on it.  Disappointed that I could not use it in my car...oh well.  Griffin products have good concept but their execution falls little short.  I bought their holster for my original iPhone but the clip that is attached to the holder easily broke off.  It was one of the best holster style I've seen...too bad they didn't make sure it stood the test of time.The kit comes with additional holders for original iPhone and 2nd generation iPod Touch.  It also comes with a disc so you can affix it to your dash to allow you to mount the unit other than glass surface.
2	Some screen protectors are thicker than others and some are thin as Saran wrap and suffer from air bubbles.My Review:I ordered the screen protector from the vendor SF Planet.  The screen protector is clearer and thicker than I expected.  It looks like the picture fitting the BlackBerry Curve 8350i like the original protective covering.  The product is thick enough that with care a user may only need one during the lifetime of their telephone.  The two step approach to applying the sticky screen protectors is superior to many and no bubbles.  I found this product to be very easy to apply fairly thick and crystal clear.  A little eyeglass cleaner and a soft cloth will easily remove any oily finger smudges - it is good as new.POSITIVE:- Thick for durability and no bubbles.- Very clear.- Easy to attach.- Easy to clean.NEGATIVE:- You may choose to ignore this comment - it is a personal preference.  This product like the original screen protector covers more than the screen it slightly overlaps the body of the BlackBerry.  Depending on how one handles their cell phone I can see how the edges could pry loose prematurely.  If that happens to you try trimming the protectors to the exact size of the screen.
2	Blackberry Screen Protector / B0014Z1B80I have a Blackberry 8310 (which can be found in the Options --> About menus) which supposedly is what this screen protector is designed to fit. And indeed the screen protector is perfectly shaped to fit on the screen from just above the roller ball all the way up to the silver speaker above the BlackBerry logo.But here's the thing: This product has shown me that my Blackberry screen is not perfectly flat. Run your fingers over your 8310 and if you have the same model as me you'll see what I mean - the black area with the BlackBerry logo is gently rounded into a bump shape.So it really doesn't matter that the protector went on cleanly for me or that the second pull tab worked fine and didn't leave a sticky residue or that the shape of the protector is perfect. It doesn't matter because no matter how careful you are to push all the air bubbles out they will creep steadily back in in the niche between the BlackBerry bump and the actual screen. And this lateral air bubble ends up taking up a fair whack of screen real estate unless you press it out every single time you want to use your phone.*However* all that said: This package came with three screen protectors so after going through the first two with the same results I trimmed the third one so that it cuts offs instantly before the BlackBerry bump. And now the screen protector works perfectly - flat no air bubbles no sticky mess and good protection from scratches fingerprints and the mild rough handling it receives in my purse.So I guess I recommend these for the price... if you're willing to modify them yourself... and if you can cut a clean straight line. I'm just extremely annoyed that the people who produce this product couldn't figure this out and pre-cut it FOR me. Or you know create a screen protector that could handle a slight bump without creating a permanent air bubble. But for the price I guess you get what you pay for.~ Ana Mardoll
0	There are two stickers one on the the protective screen and one on the backing. These stickers are used to separate the protective screen from the backing.  Unfortunately the sticker attached to the actual screen would not peel off. This leaves the screen protector unusable. There were three screen protectors and they all had the same problem.
2	The part that has the white piece on it that is not the part for the phone everybody messed the first one up clean the phone first I hope you get the best out of them. You need it the first day you buy the phone because you will have scratches on the phone and they will be there forever so protect the phone when it comes out the box the very first day.
0	That was so not cool I searched for a screen protector especifically for my Blackberry 8350i and when it arrives it doesn't fit my blackberry!!!!! I am so pissed off they either sent me the wrong product or advertised it wrong. Either way I didn't take any action because the product is so cheap that it would cost its price to return it and it's too much of a hasle.I did still put it on my screen even though it doesn't fit (too big) and amazingly it still didn't fall off and looks very transparent and it's very protecting. If this fit my phone it would've been the best product ever because the quality of this thing is very good.Seller if you're reading this I deserve a real 8350i Blackberry Curve screen protector.Thanks.
0	I have been protecting the screen of my BB curve for the past 3 yrs. I custom cut it from a long universal plastic screen protector. For a change I order this product and dismayed of it. The good side of it are a.) it has a tiny cleaning cloth; and b.) 100% exactly the same size of BB screen. The bad side are: 1.) it can't be re-applied if you mess-up; and 2.) one of the 2 tabs that said please peel of this mask before application is harder to remove. The paste on it had dried signifying that it is an old stock.It is faster and satisfying to cut the old way. I odered 5 pieces of it (5x3 =15)and it would take me awhile to finish it off. I wasted 2 already in my initial application. The first was trash-out cause it would not stick for re-alignment. The second I used a wet napkin to remove the dried paste and it not only leave scratches on new screen protector but the dried paste can't be removed at all. The more I attempt to remove the dried paste the bigger the area it spreads its sticky mess.It's not worth returning and will just throw it away and go back to the old way of doing it.
2	this screen protection is for the blackberry curve i got only 3 in the pack i only used 1 to put on works great !
0	No good.  Used this a handful of times for *light* duty of charging a phone.  After using about 5 times I received a red fault light.  Plugged a couple more times into the cigarette lighter to see if problem resolves and it blew the fuse on the car.  Will not buy this brand again.Company would not stand behind product - told me to contact Amazon but b/c it was more than 30 days I'm out of luck.
2	I bought these specifically because they were the brand of my phone.  I have bought around 10 of these over the last year most are still working as well as they ever have a few I have broken because they are fragile and bad build quality.  They have always charged extremely slowly as well.  The last batch I bought actually makes my phone spaz out when it's charging.  They function but be careful with them...and if the newer ones keep coming the same as the new ones I got...don't plan on using your touch screen while charging your phone...and if you use a Droid...you know you are almost always charging.
2	The Motorola Travel Charger for Motorola RAZR 2 V8 V9 V9M Q9 and Q9H worked for about a 8 months.  I left it plugged in and just connected or disconnected the phone.  It stopped working after about 6 months.  Too bad.  The cord was over 4 feet and at least for me the perfect size.
2	These seem to have a very low build quality.  However they are charging the phones just fine.  Time will tell if they hold up or not.  So far so good.
2	I am thankful to find a charger that will charge my older Motorola Rapture (VU30) phone but I am so aggravated by the claim this is a Motorola product when indeed it is not.  Motorola is used throughout the Product Description without any mention of Motorola compatible so I expected to receive a Motorola branded charger.  It works so I will keep the product and see how long it lasts.
0	When I recently received this battery I immediately noticed that it suspiciously looked used (it had deep marks scratched on the ends) and I had my doubts ...  But I wanted to give it the benefit of doubt and went ahead and charged it for use.It appears this is NOT a new battery for it only holds a charge on Stand by Only (with no calling at all) for just four days (and I am in a good 3G area) ... a new battery is supposed to last up to 10 days on stand by only.  This battery I received is no better than the old worn out battery I am trying to replace.  Why would it be advertise as a new battery when it is obviously used?  In fact my old battery looks newer than this one.Maybe it was my order ... but because of this seemingly false advertising I cannot recommend.
0	bought 5 cables for my 3gs after reading many reviews but none of them is working. They say this accessory is not supported everytime I plug it in. USELESS
2	I bought mine from Seller1ON1 as an extra cable for my iPhone 4S. For less than $1 shipped I figured I didn't have anything to lose. I knew I was getting an inferior item. I just needed an emergency cord to keep at home. Cosmetically the generic and OEM cables look very similar but the construction on this cable feels very cheap. Where the cord joins the pin connector the sheath is shorter and not glued in so the wire covering can come undone if pulled on repeatedly through use. It's also crooked (see my photos in gallery). Be careful to grip the connector pin not the cord.It fits the 4S transfers data and charges but the fit is very tight. It requires force to insert and remove and I'm afraid of damaging my phone's pins. Tested on aniPod nano (5th Generation)as well with same results. My original cable does not require me to forcibly yank out the cord. I would recommend spending the extra money to get the official Apple cable unless you need one just as backup and don't mind it getting lost or breaking easily.
2	I have a iPhone 4 and my case allows the OEM cable thru but this new cord is bigger than the OEM one.  So if your case is tight like mine around the cord then you have to file down the sides so it will fit.  It is a pain but since the cable is by far cheaper I am ok with that.  Too bad the company just could not make them the same size.  It should not be that hard to do.
0	I have an original USB charging cable from over two years and never had a problem. I recently wanted to have an extra cable and I bought this one. In less than three months it started to show problems... charging was constantly interrupted and I had to move the cable a bit so it would start charging again. Today it was not working at all and the cable completely ripped apart.It may be cheap but definitely not worth if only last 3 months. I better go to Apple store and buy an original one.
2	I ordered 5 of these. After a week only 2 still work. The connector end is a fraction too large so you have to sort of push hard to get it to plug into the iPad 1 2 or iPhone 4. The cable also pulls easily from the modules at both ends exposing the internal wiring. Immensely poor quality. Is the seller/manufacturer had paid closer attention to the manufacturing tolerances and sealed the cable inside the module with a little glue or maybe heat shrink it would be much better.
2	Not OEM.  I ordered 3 and 2 were bad.  Great dealer quickly replaced the two defective ones with two working cables.
0	the cable doesn't work not sure if I got a bad cable or something I soon as I put it in nothing happen it won't work in the wall or in my PC good thing it was cheap or I would have been really piss.
2	Well the cable took over a month to get here and it worked the couple of times i charged my ipad and now it doesn't work at all just stay away from these made in China and just get the original
2	Doesn't last long at all. Shortly after I got this cord it went out. I would say find a quality cord or stick with Apple.
0	Dont trust it it failed after a week just like every other knockoff I have purchased. Get a good brand name and tape it to something you never lose.
2	First time I tried to disconnect it from my IPOD the cover over the IPOD connection came off but I was able to click/squeeze it back on.  Now that I am aware of that I take off carefully (squeeze the sides hard) and it comes off fine.  It works well with my IPOD and USB connection to my car radio.  That is all I wanted.
2	I don't recommend this item   its says apple compatible (when I plug the USB to my laptop to charge the phone it says.... item not supported)
2	Ok so you have kids and they go through the genuine Apple Power cords like water then this is for you. At the price point they are great. They work just fine but I have purchased about twenty of these ten at a time and they work.I gave them only three star as they seems to wear even faster than Apples. The cables seem to feel weird after several months of use. Like sticky? And no it not a hygiene thing from the kids. I'm talking ah out the rubber changing.Bottom line at this price when the get thu funk swap it out and dump the old one.~e
2	This work as well as you'd expect for a cheap cable. I order these for my kids and toss them when they break. My kids break these at a rate slightly higher than the oem cables.
0	Every time I plug this so called product into iPhone 4 it says Impossible to charge with this device. Or something like that. What is the reason of buying it?! Just another disappointment...
2	It worked ok for awhile but now it's not working as good anymore. I still have it and I'm still using it but it doesn't charge all the time anymore. But for the price.. I guess you get what you pay for.

0	Whenever I plugged my iphone 4s up with this cable it would charge and then disconnect within seconds and it did this until it finally just stopped working all together. Another iphone accessory that I wasted money on. It makes more sense to just buy the accessories from Apple. It's more money but it's worth it at least they'll work.
0	Order 20 30 pin Apple cables none of them work with any of our devices computers and power supplies.  It was a good price well good if the product worked and probably less than return postage.
0	I got this pack of 5 cables knowing that they were not original apple cables nor original replacements. Knowing this I know the issues that come with these cables if you disconnect them by pulling on the cable instead of the connector they tend to fall apart which is not a problem for me as I allways remove from the connector not pulling on the cable however these are so cheaply made that even with this care they stop working. 3 out of the 5 cables are dead now I havent used the other 2 one of them is falling apart at the joint of the dock connector due to the natural twist of the cable. The other two just even get recognized by my device any longer even though the cable looks in perfect shape. If you wiggle the cable it will eventually connect but the moment you touch the device it will drop the connection.
0	Save your money.  Two of these things shorted out fortunately my devices weren't garaged.  These cables are cheap rubbish really!
2	I have not purchased this product yet. I gave it three stars since it seems to be a 50/50 proposition.  It seems from the reviews there are over 1900 5 stars reviews and over 1800 1 star reviews I guess I buy two of them and hope one of them works. For those of you that don't read reviews very often you should. I have been warned off of low-quality products lots of times and since I buy a lot from Amazon I'm better off for reading them.
2	As a replacement for the price it works.  Cheap product but works.I had one issue one of the ones I received wore out pretty quick.  The wire pulled away from the port pretty easily.
0	Does not fit my iPhone 4.  Cheaply and poorly constructed.  I was really duped by this sale and do not recommend others buying this item except directly from Apple.
0	These are weak and very poorly made. You would be better off if you spent a little more money and purchased a more expensive cable it would be worth your time and money to do so.
2	It works but it is missing the release buttons on the sides like the original cables have.  However it has rounded ends and everything else seems to be the same as the original cables.  I would have given it four stars if it had the release buttons and five stars if it was gold plated but what do you expect for the price.
2	This is a knock-off that looks very similar to the real Apple USB Charging cable. However it is just a fake. The cord itself is a shade thinner than the current Apple USB cable and the quality of the coating on the wire is cheap. If you look at it side by side with a genuine cable you can tell that the plastic is also of much cheaper quality. If you need just an extra charging cord this is not a bad solution but it doesn't do the job any better than some cheaper knock-offs. However it does look very similar to the genuine product so if you really care about how it looks you can pay a little more for this one.I already had many cheap knock-offs and wanted a genuine cable which would not ruin my iPhone/ iPad 2 with repeated usage so I sent this one back for a refund. Return was free through Amazon as the cable really wasn't the genuine product as per the description.
2	I bought 2 of these. One came really long and the other came really short. Strange.I have noticed it is verrrrry slow on charge time. I mean painfully slow...aint nobody got time for dat! ;-)I also think it might be affecting my overall charge because I notice it is not holding as long of a charge since I have been using it. Not worth it. Pay a little more for a real one.
0	have purchased four and all of them stop working they spit at the end of the cordone the plug can apart
2	i ordered this sets of cords a couple of weeks ago 7/20 set of four fist cord is already broken 7/31 it didnt fall apart it just wont charge. i am a firm believer in you get what you pay for i read other reviews and went with this product just a tad bit more but see hear is the thing these people are making millions by selling faulty ware to people like me that wont return a product. I paid for four chargers after 5 days the charger isnt working  now i am down to 3 this is not right so people pay the $20 buck for an original apple charger you will be better off. i am sure before the end of next month I will once again be searching for chargers...smh
2	Delton Premium Iphone 4s Data Sync Cable - Retail Packaging - White The cord was normal length and much too short to really be useful.
0	I bought 2 of these and they both stopped working within about a month. I didn't spend a lot of money but obviously something is wrong with them.
2	These cables did not do the trick for me. They lasted a week or so and immediately started to fall apart botha t the base o the wire and at the metal part. The wire also started to rupture after a few weeks.
2	The only reason that I gave this product 2 stars is because it works. If it weren't for that it would get a 1. After only a week the cable part is starting to pull out of the bottom of the part that goes into my phone. I can see the cables so I am questioning how long it will last.The sad part is that this is an extra cord that I keep in my bedroom for charging my phone at night. The only action it sees is 1 plug in at night and 1 unplug in the morning.I wasn't really expecting much for what I paid but with how little I actually handle it I am pretty disappointed.
0	When I unplugged this for the first time it came apart. I paid cheap I got cheap. Not even worth the time to comment
2	These cables are not OEM and some are not compatable with the IPhone or Ipads.  Some say not charging or accessory not recognized.  I ordered 6 of them and 3 of them did not work on my Iphone 4.
2	I've bought several of the cheap iPhone cables from different vendors. I see no difference and think it is the same product from the same manufacturer so I suggest buying the cheapest one. I think they wear out faster than the real Apple cables but at such a cheap price you come out ahead e-cycling a broken cheap cable and buying a new one.
2	After about 4 month of usage it is broken today. I'd expect a simple USB cable shouldn't last that short time
0	I bought two of these and within the month the head had come loose from the wire cover exposing the wires.  Basically fell apart and stopped working. I went to Monoprice and got some iPhone cables for just as cheap but they were very high quality.
2	Not anything as strong as the Apple that came with our iPads and iPhones but they did last a couple months and fair to the cost.  I'll probably find ones with stronger wire-to-adapter connections but these were a great value worked no tech problems.
2	I bought this cable because it was very cheap and I was in need of a cable. I received the cable promptly and was ready to test the cable on my new iPod touch 4g. I connected the cable to my computer and the iPod received no charge from the cable. I tried it on my brother's 2nd gen and still received no charge. I contacted the seller and received a refund the same day.
2	The cable still charges my phone but it will not sync to iTunes anymore. I have tried 2 other real iPhone cords and have had no trouble syncing.
2	The cord worked good for a while but started not too. Kept saying  it wasn't compatiable the device. But it listed the Iphone $s as one of its device for compatiablitiy.
0	You got what you pay for. Got the inexpensive wires to fin that will not work with my IPad 2. I use it for other devices but did not work for what I purchased for.
0	I bought from ccceaccessories for 1 penny. I guess you get what you pay for. Fell apart after only one week of minimal use. Bought this has a 3rd spare cable for fiancee it broke very quickly.
0	I was skeptical because I read some not so great reviews.  It works to charge and to sync. I take good care of my cords so I do not anticipate any issues.April 2014. I ordered another one and it doesn't work at all.
0	This particular brand didn't last but about a month.  Try to find another brand.  Most of these are good though.
2	Don't recommend it doesn't charge. I bought them cause they were cheap and I got what I paid for! Not good
0	READ UPDATE!As always my Apple cord shorted out and I was in need of another. This was a great cheap working replacement charger!UPDATE: Literally a few hours later the cord won't sync to the computer. It only charges. I can't get around this at all. Also the cord is very hard to get into the port and out of the port. Very cheaply made. SAVE MONEY AND BUY OTHER CABLE!
2	The cord was not what I thought it was and it goes in and out of a charge. As soon as it starts to charge I can come back to my phone and it's back to square one. The battery actually went down than charged.
2	Its made a little wider than the Apple one. The Apple one fits into the slot on my bumper but this one is too wide so I had to cut off some of the plastic with a knife.
0	The materials and design are not nearly as durable as the ones that come with your phone. These are delicate and easily broken. I ordered 2 and 1 didn't work at all.
2	This will get you by for a while but will fail in the long run. Just be gentle and it will last longer.
0	I bought 20 of these figuring if they lasted a couple months each I'd have years worth of cables.  The ones I've used have barely made a week.  The one in my car lasted two uses...  One that I gave away lasted less than a couple hours...  I understand that these cords are provided by different companies and some may be better than others.  The company I bought from was Ships from Hong Kong.  I emailed them about the issue but have not heard anything back from them.  Clearly a waste of money and time.  I'm only out &lt;$20 so I'll just consider it a cheap reminder that you get what you pay for. I have two apple cords that are still kicking after years of use whatever they cost I assume it's worth the extra amount.
0	No matter the cpu or usb 2.0 or 3.0 even usb plug adapter this item still non functional it tries to connect you hear & see the signs but never makes it. Went to microcenter and purchase one there.after taking it apart modifying the wiring I got it to work using lower gauge high quality copper wires.
0	While this item looks virtually identical to the original Apple cable my iphone 3GS tells me charging is not supported with this accessory. I don't know how my phone can tell the difference but it only likes to be charged with the original. I was able to use the retractable type cable for a few months before they quit working. But for this price I can't complain.
2	just ok did not work well all apples
0	cord should be at least 1 m long not 12&#34;. even a good price doesnt save this bad product. and when you call the company -it's &#34;oh we're sorry - it's out of stock - thats why we sent the short ones.&#34;
0	Do not buy this. It is not apple certified. Pay more and get a real cord. My dad burnt up the drive in his iPhone using non apple certified cords so don't risk it.
0	I was better off buying the true product from the Apple Store in stead... Total waste of money. Won't connect with many things and the stuff it does connect with it won't keep the charge going for long. AWFUL!
0	These things are terrible! At least the ones I got from itemsforless. The cord pulled out at the phone end.Come on Amazon get these sellers off the web site! It's getting as bad as E-bay.
0	I waited almost 2 months for this product and when I finally got it it didn't even work. The worst dollar ever spent. :(
2	I bought 5. Three didn't work right out of the package. I kinda expected that based off of reviews that's why I bought 5 in the first place.
2	I bought 4 of these cables and they look just like OEM cables but they don't work like OEM. When trying to use them with my iPhone charger they constantly disconnect and reconnect which causes the charging indicator sound to go off all the time. I have to reposition my phone to get it to stay charging. They won't work with my original iPad it will start to charge and then pop up and say charging is not supported with this accessory.
0	The price was great and the reviews were mixed.  I took a chance and ordered two cables.  The ends that connect to your iPhone were completely out of alignment on both cables!  I contacted seller and they thought I should try to get it to work.  There was no possible way I was going to take a chance on damaging my iPhone.  The seller sent two more cables and they were no better.  When I contacted the seller for a refund they wanted me to return the cables.  It makes no sense to spend more than the amount of the refund shipping the defective cables back to the seller!  JUST BE WARNED -- DO NOT BUY!  THIS PRODUCT IS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY.
2	The cable is cheap and it lives up to expectations.  Works fine but after only a few months the cable sheathing has torn near the iphone connector.  Debateable whether spending money to buy a few of these $0.90 cables or much more on a genuine Apple cable is worth it...
0	yes its very very cheap so i thought what the hell ill just buy it. The cord only worked for about a week before it randomly stopped being able to charge my phone lol dont waste ur money it takes like a month for shipping
0	I will never buy another cord from any of the sellers...they break or just don't work from the start.  some claim to be Apple certified but none are!
0	The cord took almost a month to get to me and then when I finally did get it it did not work!! I guess you get what you pay for
0	I made the mistake of purchasing this charger cord.As soon as I connected my iPhone 4 to the charger it started to overheat and within 5 minutes the charger and cable was burning hot.The bottom line is that the price on these chargers should ring alarm bells! I learned my lesson.STAY AWAY and buy a genuine Apple charger instead!The adapter however does NOT charge the iPhone4. I receive &#34;Charging is not supported with this accessory&#34; when connecting.
0	I only got the ipad cable I didn't receive this one! I totally forgot about this one.  I knew something was missing but didn't realize or remember what it was until I got this email.
0	I rarely used it to begin with but now it just won't even charge or work at all.  It's very frustrating.
0	i purchased 6 of these for extra chargers in the car office and home. Within 1 week NONE of them would work. Some quit the first time I tried using them. POOR quality and a waste of money and time.. But a better charger. I have tried contacting seller and no reply!!!!!
0	I don't mind buying non-Apple parts but when they are advertised as being Apple OEM parts and they turn out to be cheap Chinese knock-offs then I am disappointed. I bought 3 and they are not even uniform. Even the USB logo is on the opposite side of one plug. I had to grind them down with a nail file to make them fit a bumper on an iPhone 4. They are ok for the price but giving one star for selling a counterfeit instead of simply saying they are 3rd party cables.
0	I'm not sure if it's apple or the actual chord but eventually the chord stops charging the Idevices and iv'e noticed this with both my ipad and ipod. It's says This device is not supportedIt took about a month fir this message to occur on both my devices but i'm sure it's a waste of money.
2	For the amount of time they worked they worked very well but then they just stop working for no reason I guess you get what you pay for
2	never been too impressed with apples 3ft charging cable. Wish it was longer and more durable but I guess we dont really have too many choices when Buying apple products.
2	I ordered two of these from the OEM For Cheap seller.  Neither cord fits well - not the USB side or the Apple side.  They are hard to put in and take out and have to be forced.  I'm worried that would hurt my iPhone and MacBook Pro over time so I'm only going to use for emergency charging.  Of the two cords only ONE works AT ALL.  It can both Sync and Charge.  The other is a complete dud.  I've asked for a refund on the one that doesn't work.  I will update once I know how the seller handles it.*** UPDATE *** The seller handled it professionally.  They sent me a new (working) cord and told me to recycle the bad one.  Still have the same fit problems and also I have noticed the charge time is a lot longer than my real charger.  Still keeping for emergencies only.
2	lasted one week shy of a month now it will not charge nor connect to my phone or pc. would not waste my time or money recommend looking else where for a more dependable cord for my iphone 4s/ had high hopes after reading reviews but alas its not worth the time and effort to order another to risk it failing and having no means of charging my phone. got two stars because at first worked great just buyer beware.
2	These like most generic iphone/ipod products are a hit and miss. I'm batting .500 and because I'm a gambling man I like my odds. MAy work perfect for you for a long time may not work at all or may work for one charge. Your taking a low risk and I think its worth the risk.
2	You get what you pay for. This is a hit or miss product. At this price order 3 or 4 of them and chances are you'll end up with 2 or 3 good ones and STILL not spend nearly as much for the authentic Apple cords.
2	This cable maybe cheap butit was stuck in my iphone the few timesplugging and unplugging make's easier to plug in. Tips: Some howmold both side's of the plug to match your old one(when I waspulling it out the first time I notice the side's of the plugwas deformed try grinding it down somehow).After a few weeks later my iphone said charging is not compatiblewith this accessories and i pull it part and only the data pinswas attached to the cable.
2	These are not the quality of the Apple OEM parts but for the price I am happy enough with them to order them again.
2	I bought 2 chargers for my i phone 4S and after 6 months one died.So be aware that u get what u pay for!
2	It just won't fit right on the new iPad. I've tried both purchased cables neither one worked. If I pushed it in harder still one side won't go in completely then the other side would have hard time to pull out. So this is not a good cable for iPad. There is no problem using the original iPad USB cable.
0	Okay so i changed my comment on this. I thought my dad said it worked but it didnt charge my dads phone. I really disaponted :/
2	I loved it and it worked perfectly but only for about a month. One day it just quit working. period. no power data anything and I didn't use it any differently.
0	First time I got it it was not working. So the company was nice and sent another. However this new one was broken as well and fell apart within seconds.
2	In many things electronic generic can be and often is perfect in working great and costing considerable less. In this case that was not the case both cables while they looked fine were not. Plugging in to my iPod or iPhone or iPad the connector was very stiff to where I was concerned I might be damaging the connector part in the device. Also they would not work to charge or sync our iPads as they would never charge or connect but they would work to charge the iPhone iPod and that shouldn't matter! 30 pin should be 30 pin! I had bought these as our original cables are wearing and even with these not working as good as they should I will probably try another set as needed. With stock being about $30.00 each that will buy many generics and I'm certain I'll find as good as stock units just not these.
0	First of all the shipping took so long I forgot I ordered them.  They looked good at first so I kind of got excited about having these extra two cables that I didn't remember ordering.  When I plugged the first one in to my iPhone 4 the connection was VERY snug.  No problem right?  The sync finished and I went to unplug except it wouldn't unplug.  When I used more pressure the cable disintegrated and we had a situation where the raw wires were coming out (see one of the pictures in the description).  I was worried about getting electrocuted and what not but I eventually got the connector out of the phone using pliers.Second cable same thing.  Cable was too snug and too cheap.These cables are absolutely worthless.
0	they were fine for about one week and they stopped working completely. i bought the twp thinking they would work perfect for a long time but both are now useless.
2	This cord works fine except it will not work plug into the computer  and it gets tangle a lot other wise it works good
0	It stopped working after 2 weeks it tells me it is not compatible with my phone. Worked for only about 1 week.
0	Bought two USB cables.  Thought I'd give it a whirl.  Took a while to receive them turns out neither of them work...Don't waste your time and money.
0	Don't even work I hate this product it stop workin after 10mins ill never buy from this company again worst money spent its dont cost a lot for a good reason cause it beyond cheap
0	It.s hard to rate it because I have not got it yet and I do not know what the hangup is I payed my bill but no cable yet.
2	I bought this cable for my iPod touch thinking that the cables for iPhone and iPod should be the same. I did not realize that there were not. It kept giving me a message that this device is not compatible with iPod for charging.
2	Well this worked well for the first charge then it broke. The company was nice enough to send me another on (which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1) but the second one broke after the first charge as well.. Would not buy another from this company.
2	you really have to jam this in and pull it out with a little force.  i didn't like it being rough on my phone so i went and bought a better cable and threw this one away.
0	Does not work. I can not synch my iPod with this. I bought this as a back up to my original but still using the original since the new one doesn't work or fit properly.
2	After a few weeks it started acting up for some odd reason and I really don't know why! Its frustrating too!
2	Go to the apple store and buy an actual iphone charger. These cheap ones break so easily its pitiful. By the time you buy two you could get a real one
2	I ordered six cables and received the promptly. A couple of them didn't work but the remaining four have been great. I didn't bother to try and return the bad ones because I got them at a such great price.
2	much need cords but they did take a little longer to get to me. I guess I need to keep up with them better. But over all worth the cost.
2	The charging cable did arrive rather quickly and it does work however it is faulty. It will stop charging for no reason and a message will pop up that says Charging isn't supported for this device. So I have to disconnect the cable & put it back in to make it charge again.Also it charges extremely slow. With a normal charging cable from Apple I can go from 0 to 100% in one hour. This generic cable takes several hours to charge my phone. It's extremely annoying and inconvenient.You get what you pay for so for a dollar and some change the cable will have to do. It's good enough for now.
2	THIS WAS A WASTE OF MONEY. IT DIDN'T EVEN WORK ON ANY OF OUR IPADS. WE SENT IT BACK. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY PURCHASING THIS
0	This was super bad.It didn't charge my iPod at all in fact none of my i devices.It actually scared me to plug it up because it made my iPod n iPad say weird things.
0	I use it a couple of time till it broke. They need make it where it last longer than it should.
2	These look just like the real deal.Only problem is that it might or might not work.If it does work it works like a champ.If it doesn't work then you just wasted a dollar.Most stores will charge you $10 for one of these cables.I think it's worth the purchase
2	This cord takes about twice as long to charge my iPad 2 in comparison to my OEM cable. This is frustrating when you charge the tablet overnight and wake up with only an 80% charge. I have also noticed that if I am charging the iPad while using it the battery actually still drains.  This cable will not charge the battery (even though it indicates it is) or even maintain it's current charge if you are using the tablet. I gave the product more than one star only because it will charge the tablet albeit over a long period of time of non-use.***UPDATE***I just noticed the product description says For Apple iPhone iPod Sync data or charging.  I honestly can't recall if the description mentioned iPad compatibility when I purchased it some time ago but perhaps this cable works better for the smaller devices. It is still disappointing  that it doesn't work well with the iPad considering that I can use my iPod cable interchangeably with my iPad and get the same charge results. In any event I am leaving my two star rating so that others considering this product for their tablets understand the cons associated with it.
2	I needed a new usb cable so for a tester i brought one. Not bad if you need a extra cable.
0	I'm not sure why this is called a charging cable it does not work as such. We didn't get it for about 8 weeks after ordering and ended up getting a refund but it didn't matter about the money the wait time was frustrating (we obviously ordered it for a reason we needed it). After all that waiting it didn't work. Don't waste your time or your dollar.
0	I figured for the price it was to good to be true and it was! got it and it didnt even work on an iphone or ipod.
2	Hi this product is kinda the same when it comes to the looks of it but I get error message whie using it with my iphone SOMETIMES.I wish that was not the case because the price and the shipping was great .
0	It works but is not solid and broke very quickly after a few uses I wouldn't buy again for sure.
2	Doesn't work on my iPad but does work for my phone and iPod.  It was cheap what can I say?
2	These are okay but I wouldn't depend on it all the time.  They will work but they don't last long.  If you are planning on using this daily go ahead and spend the extra money to get the real deal.  If you are just going to put this in your purse for a back up then this is for you
2	Bought it then it stopp working. Didn't have it for long. Kinda disappointed so just ought one from the apple store
0	This is advertized as a data transfer cable and guess what it works to transfer data.  If you think since it looks exactly like the $30 cable from Apple it will also charge your iphone....IT WON'T.
0	Out of the 5 chargers I gnly 2 of them were working  I was really dissapointed and upset  that they didn't work )-;
2	The wire connection to the 30 pin end tends to get a short in it or just completely stop working.  One stopped working all together and the other one seems ok.  I think some of it has to do with how my kids handle the cables too.  Treat them gently and they should work fine for you but they won't stand up to much rough handling.
2	these are cheap cheap cheap in all aspects. looks like the originals at first but after a month or two the cable joints start coming off exposing the inner wires at the junction of the wire and the plugs.
0	Broke instantly! Not worth my money! I'm tired of waisting my money on these! Nothing like the original! :( :(
0	This works SOMETIMESHowever most of the time it refuses to charge and even overheats your device. Simply do not buy this piece of shit spend a dollar or more and get a brand that knows what they are doing
2	good wire. worked well for a while. then went bad. as expected cheap wire. good results. was great while it lasted
0	The cord does not work for long it already has a shortage and is not working at all NOT COOL OR A GOOD PRODUCT!!!!
0	THIS CHARGER WAS HORRIBLE THE WIRES STARTED SHOWING AFTER 1 DAY AND SOMETIMES I HAVE TO PLUG AND UNPLUG MY IPHONE MULTIPLE TIMES BECAUSE I GET A MESSAGE THAT SAYS THIS ITEM IS NOT SUPPORT BY IPHONE. ITS EXTREMEMLY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE ITS ALREADY FALLING AND APART AND BARELY CHARGES MY PHONE. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING.
0	I guess you get what you pay for. Attempted to disconnect my charging iPhone from this cable and it snapped apart.
2	This is very inexpensive cable for the iPod/iPhone. It is identical in looks. It came in a smallish pouch with no box or any literature at all. I already tried it and it works by charging my iPhone (I have a 3GS with an Otterbox case).  Are there any issues?  It is very difficult to remove.  This is the cable that you just pull to disengage not the older cable that has a bigger end (not the one that has buttons on each side that you need to pinch before can pull it off).  It is very hard to remove that is actually scary I might damage the connector of my iPhone.
2	IT works for charging any apple device but when it comes to syncing any data that can be difficult. Since it is generic it tends not to want to sync data sometimes.
0	This item is not even worth your time... Please take my advice and keep scrolling pass this or you will be disappointed for purchasing.
2	It's worth about the dollar I paid for it! Didn't charge my I pad and worked for about two weeks before the wires pulled out the bottom. Cheap cheap cheap
0	stop working after 2 weeks time.. pls dont waste your time. this product is cheap and it no longer works
2	this product was ok but when i got it the cord got lose i guess and i was already able to see the wire. the cords where a little shaky but it was ok overall.
0	The product was very cheaply made. You can tell by how it feels. It does not even feel like a regular iPod cable. It does not charge my device well at all. I bought a few so I could stick one at work and have a few backups but it appears as though they are practically useless. Don't waste your money.
2	Super cheap! i ordered about 10 of these because I'm always losing mine or leaving them in random walls at people's houses. 3 of them didn't work at all! They feel very cheap but for a penny a piece hell I'll risk it to get 7 working :)
2	it is tight for i phone. u have to push hard and pull hard. I stopped using may damage i phone pins. Dont want to risk $599 to save $7
0	Item was ordered from Boho Tronics ($2.75). It is not an Apple product but a knockoff or possibly a reject. It took almost 3 weeks to come. It doesn't work. Won't sync or charge my iPod Touch. I reordered it from PriceMasters ($3.19). After reordering I realized that this may also turn out to be a knockoff or reject. I'll wait and see. Possibly this vendor is the same as the first (different name) or vendors use the same knockoff supplier. It's inconceivable that an real Apple cable ($19.00) could be sold for $2.75.Amazon should not allow the device to be described as by Apple if it's not by Apple.--------------------------------------This a follow up to the above.The order from PriceMasters ($3.19) arrived today. This one doesn't even fit into my iPod Touch. I won't force it for fear of damaging the unit.Save your money and try one from Griffin ($14.15)[...]At least you can return it to Amazon for a refund.or still betterspend the full $19.00 and go directly to Apple.
0	Used for one week (if that) and thought it was great but now it will not charge any of my apple products.  It is garbage.
2	Works great at first then it doesn't after a few weeks :/ very cheap but u get what u pay 4
0	This is a piece of junk do not waste your time or money. Not sure how they got away with selling this garbage!
2	its a cable s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss sssssss sssssssssss
2	These just do not last long.although it arrived on time once we used it it didnt take long to discover how bad it sucked.I would NEVER order these again!
0	This only worked for a few times to charge my iphone.  Then I stopped working and would not charge my phone.
2	It is always good to have extra cables and at the price it is well worth it to order extras for car work and home.
2	IT IS VERY BAD AND DIDN'T LAST A LONG TIME WHICH SHOCK ME BECAUSE OF AN APPLE PRODUCTVERY DISSAPPOINTED OK
0	The cable's external insulation separated from the connectors on both sides of the cable (phone-end and Mac-end) within one week.  That left the internal wires exposed. Junk junk cheap junk.
0	I received the cable when/how described. But when I pluged the cable into my computer to charge my phone then unpluged it. The uSB portion of the cable stayed in the computer!Never again!
0	The charger worked perfectly fine for about 3 days Then you had to out it in a certain position. After about a two weeks it stopped working. DO NOT BUY WASTE OF MONEY
0	The same day I got this I was using it to charge my grandsons iPad and it fell a part the end that plugs into the iPad came apart will not buy anymore from this sealer they are cheap made not worth the money it was a waste sorry.
2	I bought three of these so I would have one for my work computer home computer car charger and use the original with the wall adapter. One became defective and no longer works for charging or syncing. Send me another and I'll give you a five star review. The other two work just as well as apple's.
2	Cable does the job and I only bought it as a cheap alternative to the overly pricey manufacturer brand name cables.  Occasionally does not work properly when charging the iphone; Just unplug and replug return to working order.
2	The USB end of the plug was a little bent so I had to fix that and the 30 pin end of the plug fits really snug but it does work for its purpose thankfully.
2	Average.  They work perfectly fine they just get stuck in the phone and sometimes I have to roughly attach and disconnect the cord.  I ordered extre cords because my others burnt out.  They work and for the price I will keep using them.
0	this cable does work however the material it is made of it of very poor quality. then end where it connects to the phone rips very easily.and also the end that connects to the phone is a little thicker than the Apple cable. you have to wiggle the cable out when it's plugged in because it doesn't slide out as well as the Apple cable. you're better off spending a little more and buying a genuine Apple cable. it will last you a lot longer..
2	I bought 3 of these and 2 broke within weeks.  They were so cheap it wasn't worth driving to the post office and paying return postage to return them so I just called it a loss.  Maybe a good buy if you need a charger you could lose or damage for a camping trip or something.
0	Don't buy it. The cord is no longer than the Apple one the seller lies and say's it is and it has syncing problems.
0	My iPhone cable needed to be replaced because the wires were exposed. I noticed it starting to come apart a few days ago and decided to order this one. I was relieved when I received it today because this cable really should be thrown out and replaced. I'm afraid of a fire or something. When I plugged it in I was very disappointed to find that it didn't charge my phone. I tried a different outlet and then I tried the USB port on my laptop. Nothing worked. Sending it back to Amazon but have to find one at a store so I can continue charging my phone.
2	DID WHAT IT HAD TO DO FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME I DONT KNOW IF ITS THE QUALITY OF THE THING OR ME CAUSE THE RUBBER FROM THE WIRE CAME OUT AFTER ME USING IT FOR A MONTH STOPPED CHARGING MY PHONE AND NOW I BASICALLY HAVE TO WRIGGLE IT AROUND TO GET IT TO CHARGE
2	I'm very disappointed with this because the product seemed to charge the phone but after a few minutes multiple times my phone restarted. I'm very disappointed mainly because I really don't want to spend $19 for a replacement charger. Waste of time and money.This is an additional review to the item. My actually APPLE Charger has basically kicked the bucket and in desperation I plugged in this charger to see what it can do and if maybe cutting my phone off was a short habit. Turns out the charger works great and also doesn't cut my phone off anymore. I'm very pleased.UPDATE: Aug. 12 2011. This cord has stopped working. It barely even shorts out. It just doesn't work like it's supposed to. So I'm out of luck until I find ANOTHER one. I really don't want to by the Apple cord but that may be in works for me.
0	Great charger for the first day and then it broke the next day which sucked because I really needed that charger because my other one broke !
0	Stopped working after a week but I guess the price suits it well... I paid $1 for it and was going to use it as a car charger adapter but that was to no avail.
0	Every iphone connector seems to break or the wires will comeout within a month or two and i'll have to buy another one for like $5 or less they all suck.
0	I purchased this cable through Nathan Norris. Please please please save yourself the money and DO NOT buy this cable. Mine stopped working after having it just a little over a month. Unfortunately I'm now outside the timeframe for returns and I'm stuck with a USB cable that's completely useless.Save your money don't buy!
0	Beware who you buy from as there are many vendors out there all whom seem to have some version or another.I ordered this from one of the vendors and the vendor actually sent me an older style which had the release clasps (for old ipod classics and video) it'll work however it WAS NOT what I ordered and another thing I learned from studying this connector:It's of shoddy quality...  The center ground blades on the Apple's Proprietary-side was coming apart my point?Look you probably spent $300+ on your iPod Touch or iPhone why cheap-out on a shoddy cable and have the possibility of ruining the connector?Connector 101 - It takes two connectors to mate but only one to destroy the mate.  I've decided to just fork over the dough to Apple and get a genuine one at least that's made to tolerance and is good.Buying from various sellers on here is a random crap-shoot cheaping out and buying these knock-offs will have the chance of destroying your little mobile investment...I would stay far away from these.  I've learned my lesson luckily the vendor gave me a full refund ($1.50 woohoo!) that being said the vendor probably knows that his/her products are questionable at best...
0	at first the cable seem to work well but in a short period of time they quit working... after taking apart I see why.  The solder connections are horrible... really surprised about the poor connection.  Like the cheap cost but charge a bit more and do the cables right.
2	The cords were a lot smaller than I thought they were. I guess I should've read the details more they are less than 6&#34; long maybe a tad bit longer but still not what I thought.
2	These could be DOA last a couple of weeks or a couple of months depending on the seller. The seller I used to buy from doesn't seem to carry them anymore and I tried three more who all sent me DOA cables. I had sent them to employees in Cameroon Africa so there was no way I could send them back for a refund and the sellers said they couldn't do anything about it. Amazon of course helped out. I'm done with the iPhone cables. I'd suggest looking at one of the Micro USB to Apple 30-pin Converter Tip I ended up with the Lenmar ones. Or FiiO makes ones that have a USB port for charging and a 3.5mm jack for higher quality audio out of the 30-pin connector.
0	These are inexpensive and barely work. I was attracted by the price but they are tough to make function with my kids phones.
0	it is work at the first 30 daysI brought two one of it was broken the line disconnect after 20daysthe other one works ok in the first couple timesafter 30 days it still looks prefect but suddenly when I plug into the pc nothing shows up and it became not working1 dollar for 20 days it depends on how u thinkI will never buy it cause it might not work suddenly when u really need to charge ur iphonethos was my previous reviewFvery nice price works very well.I buy two more after I got it. the usb is very good also fast shiping
0	connections poor and tight fit. hard to connect and disconnect. sometimes it works to play music from iphone and others it does not. will always charge it. never have this problem with other wires.  would not buy this again.
0	After waiting 3 weeks for this to arrive we discovered that it did NOT work.  Not only that but sparks were coming out of it!  Not only this is thing a complete piece of garbage but it's also dangerous.  We're just lucky there was no damage to the iPhone.  Consider yourself warned.  Pay a little more so you won't have to worry about this burning your house down.
2	I purchased 2 of these USB cords. One of the iPhones (my Moms phone) is a 3GS and the cord will not charge it. I get a message on the screen that says Charging is not supported with this accessory with a yellow warning triangle. Also you do not get the lightening bolt on the battery icon to indicate that it is charging. Perhaps this cord is defective. I'm wondering if these cords compatible with the iPhone 3GS. I have the iPhone 4 and it seems to work with that. I haven't tried it in my iPad yet but if there is an issue I will update this. I sent a email to the seller to see what can be done. I am not paying for shipping it back when it only costs me $1.  Hopefully they will make good and send me a replacement without me sending this one back.
0	This is a dollar store item and it's his junk instead of waiting two months for it to arrive you can go to your local dollar store and buy it there but even there you will be buying junk you just have to go to the Apple Store to get quality.
0	I bought this as a replacement but it didn't fit my IPhone 3GS at all. I plugged it into my phone and it would not come out. Once it was in there it didn't charge it but it charged my iPod. Now I'm having problems with IPod all together. I suggest you do a little more browsing before you settle for this product. I guess I got what I paid for.
2	Looks like original iPhone charge cable.If you want a cable as a spare to carry around in your gym bag or laptop bag go ahead and buy it.It *might* charge your iPad when it's new but it will stop charging after a month or so.It may continue charging iPhone/iPod till it breaks down.My recommendation: Buy 1) Amazon basics iPhone cable or 2) Buy an used genuine Apple iPhone charge cable from EBay or 3) buy from Apple.
2	i guess it worked fine but whenever I connect it to my computer it says &#34;device not compatible&#34; or something like that. I should probably buy one at Target although they're really expensive :(
2	Its ok best it did do the job no complaints good product for your iphone or apple product its a must have!
2	They don't work for your iPod they brake fast and you struggle to put it in wouldn't recommend this product to you guys
0	Worked for 3 days then never worked again. Was very disappointed with this product. Would not recommend to anyone at all.
0	I have always been a proponent of Bluetooth headset use especially when talking on the cellphone and driving at the same time. I think it is unfortunate that certain people consider using bluetooth to be uncool and somehow associated with a rather hateful stereotypical image of a Hummer-driving yuppie. If you're driving and talking GET a Bluetooth headset! I would rather see people driving around on the road like they are telephone tech supports than blind and distracted zombies. That ends my rant on why I believe everyone should be using a wireless headset. Now let's talk about this Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth.I've gone through a few Bluetooth headsets in the past few years - mostly Motorola and Jarba models priced around 20 bucks. I had absolutely no complaints regarding these economy models. When I received this 150 dollars headset(!) in the mail I was seriously expecting to be awed and shocked with a level of performance feature and luxury I had previous unexperienced.The unboxing and setup process was pretty straight forward. One fancy feature that is indeed very useful is that a leather carrying pouch was included and it isn't just any plain leather pouch either. The carrying pouch in fact has a built-in battery. When the headset is stored inside the pouch you can plug in the charging cable and charge both the headset and the charging pouch. So later on when you're on the road you in fact have two batteries ready to be used which greatly extends the hours of use between charging. Unfortunately the charging carrying case is the only positive thing I can say about this headset.According to the manual and the packaging the headset supposed to have some fancy audio-processing logic which will make the phone conversation crystal clear. Alas it was not the case. Once I got the headset bonded with my Verizon KRZR phone and made a test call to my wife the voice sounded rather dull down-sampled and somewhat metallic. This is unacceptable for a 150 BT headset! I can honestly say in term of voice clarity all my previous 20-buck Motorola/Jarba outperformed this ridiculously overpriced headset by far. I have not tried the headset with any other cell phones. But a Motorola KRZR is a rather common handset and Plantronics 925 gave me quite a let-down.In conclusion I will not recommend this headset to anyone at its current price. If it was around $30 - $40 (currently Amazon is already offering at 50% off the original listing price) and only if looks/design is more important to you than voice clarity perhaps only then I will recommend it to you.Sorry Plantronics I honestly genuinely wanted to love this headset. But for the time being I'm going back to my 20 dollar Jarba.
2	I purchased the gold version of this unit for my wife because it was rated so highly looked great and had lots of excellent features especially the fact that you could charge the case that held the unit and the case in turn could extend the charge of the unit itself.  Also the price was great at only $39.99 at the time.  The unit was pretty comfortable for me but did not fit her well because my wife's ear canal is shallow and the ear pads of the unit are designed for a deeper ear canal.  She prefers one that hooks securely around the ear.  Anyway when I plugged it in to charge it for the first time I noticed that the charger power light lit up green as soon as I plugged it in but the light went out as soon as I plugged the charger into the unit or the case for the unit.  Since the directions indicate that all lights turn off when the unit was fully charged I assumed that was the case.  However after pairing it with the phone I immediately heard it signalling that the battery was almost dead.  But when I tried to charge it the charger once again shut down when it was plugged into unit or unit case.  I have returned the unit and decided not to rebuy the same thing.  I will continue to search for a better blue tooth unit.
2	Something went wrong with my earpiece after maybe 6 months if that. The charger wouldn't charge it anymore. I tried changing chargers cords and outlets and nothing would work. Neither would the little charging case that came with it. So now I'm in the hole after an expensive purchase let me down.
2	It is amazing how I could love and hate something so intensely as I feel for the Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece.First of all what I love-The sound is fantastic- people hear me no matter where I am very well.-Wind is dulled greatly-Charges up quickly-Comes with carrier case with enough power for one charge-Fits my old Plantronics recharger-Long talk time (about 4-5 hours min with full charge)-Easy to carry-Fits really well- for the first week if I am luckyNow what I hate-The stupid case demagnetizes credit cards if it gets too close-This ear piece only stays in my ear for the first few days of a new earpiece-Once it is past a few days this earpiece will NOT stay in my ear no matter WHAT I doYes I know I am putting it on my ear correctly- the little U shaped tab goes down the ear canal and then I plug in the center silicone plug area into my ear canal.  Like I said the first few days of ownership and a new replacement pad I can wear it for the entire day with no problems.  Then after that it gets worse so fast that I can not keep it in my ear.I am so upset about this because I really truly love this earpiece. The sound and clarity is fantastic but when it pops out of my ear I not only can not hear it is dangerous if I am on the road when it happens too.I have tried everything to get this to work in my ear.  After a whole year of owning it I am going to try elastic and then probably try another one eventually when I can swing it.I can not believe how much I love and hate this thing at the same time!
0	I really don't have a clue how they can say this comes with three different sized ear buds. The buds were so close in size the I could barely tell the difference. I tried all three of them not a single one was small enough for my ear and none of them would actually be considered to be an in-ear ear bud for me. It was also not a simple chore to swap them out. I also learned my lesson (which I suspected anyway) I cannot use a headset that doesn't have something that goes over the ear to help hold it on my head. The case is actually pretty stupendous though. Would love it if all headsets came in a case like this one.
2	[Was Five Stars Now Two]I have to admit that I have not always been an admirer of the venerable and ever-present Bluetooth headset. I have silently cursed at those whose self-importance required they stare off into space while conversing with some unseen counterpart. Another problem I felt was with the gigantic bug perched on the speaker's ear--it looked simply awful.The Plantronics Discovery 925 headset promised to buck the trend not of speaking with the non-present but of drastically trimming and streamlining the size of that bug on the ear. As I needed a way to speak on my cell phone without encumbering my hand I believed I needed to accept the inevitable and get one.First I was surprised by how truly small the Discovery is! No longer does it feel like a crawling cockroach has gone to sleep on the ear but the tasteful design is as the product brochure says fashion-forward. It is light and sleek and even better no flashing blue light broadcasting like a lighthouse either.Second and more surprising was how easy it was to setup. The adequate manual instructed that my cell phone needed to be in discovery mode and also what to do to achieve a pairing between the headset and the phone. I achieved this step rather quickly and easily.It was a bit difficult to know what steps to take next as I needed to focus on how to get it working after the initial pairing. I quickly discovered that through a confusing series of beeps lengthy button pushes (the 925 has just one) and blinking lights of different colors the headset is able to make and receive calls. A more careful reading of the manual showed me the error of my usual way of jumping into using electronics: after that it was easy to know what beep meant what and what one or more colored blinks signified. Lesson: read the manual.The Plantronics came encased in a very nice carrying case which doubles as a recharging station. In other words the case houses a battery which charges the headset if cradled. It also came with two ways of charging: a direct connection to a power outlet or a USB cable for computer recharging. Very convenient.The clarity is superb and I've never had a problem understanding any phone calls. The headset is lodged into the ear lobe with the help of a soft Silicone (at least I think its Silicone) wedge which I thought would be uncomfortable at best. It wasn't and turned out to be actually pleasant.I can find absolutely nothing wrong with the Plantronics Discovery. For approximately $120 I would hope not anyway but I find its ease-of-use and setup to be so enjoyable that I heartily recommend it. I did wish the manual were a tad larger and easier to read and the user has to be really careful as I can see how easy it would be to break the headset but that's a small quibble for a phenomenal product. I guess I have walked into the light the blue light.**UPDATE** January 28 2010Within 6 months the microphone on the unit checked out and I now have an expensive paperweight. I'm downgrading this review from five stars to two stars.
2	ThePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging] work better (longer range longer battery life clearer call audio in and out).My older Plantronics 510 headset broke so decided to go with this newer 925 model. The 925 was harder to hear my calls on than the bigger less expensive 510.The 925 (this one) needed to be charged daily whereas I could go almost a week with the bigger 510. I'm guessing the 510 has a bigger battery.The 925 (this one) has less range than the bigger 510 (not a surprise).I didn't care as much for the 925 model so I returned it for another 510. Your mileage may vary.
2	it's a shame that Plantronics or any other Bluetooth vendor barely tests their products or just makes a product and they send it out into the world hoping that quantity sales makes their products seem as if they are quality products. What they don't realize is that bad reviews will eventually catch up. I was standing at BestBuy and talking to someone who said I've tried almost all of them and they aren't worth it. I would agree with that I've yet to try a Bluetooth headset that is worth buying and this one is no exception.In terms of performance this one is not very good because it picks up ALL background noises despite it claims to do the opposite.
0	This is one of the worst Bluetooths I've had.  I thought I'd try it for the price but as the saying goes &#34;You get what you pay for&#34;.
2	I've waited nearly a month since purchasing the Discovery 925 so I could get several full usage cycles out of the headset before writing this review so here it goes:Plantronics Discovery 925: Stylish Headset Mediocre PerformanceLOOKSThe first thing you'll notice about the Discovery 925 are its stylish looks. Plantronics really hit a home run in the visual design department. This is the first bluetooth headset that I've ever worn that didn't make me feel like I was one of Star Trek's Borg cyborgs. The particular unit that I purchased was gold in color. Unlike the unfortunately lit stock photos the gold color of the unit looks classy as opposed to gaudy. It's a true metallic tone the will match most dress clothing very well (so as not to look out of place at work for example). The charging case doesn't fare as well looks-wise. It's essentially a faux-leather charging case with a gold spray paint coating. But that's ok you aren't buying this for the looks of the case.FUNCTIONALITYThe whole retail setup consists of one Discovery 925 headset a matching charging case a wall charger and three gel earbuds to fit various ear sizes. The wall charger charging case and earbuds all perform their duties admirably. The wall charger is small and unobtrusive charging my particular unit to a full charge in a little over 2 hours. The charging case takes a little longer to charge but the trade off of charging time is well worth the portability and protection offered by the case. The easily removable earbuds come in a variety of sizes to fit even small ears snugly securing the unit in your ear even when you jog.The headset itself is relatively easy to use. There only two buttons (pretty much standard on any bluetooth headset these days) one very large multi-purpose button used for powering the device on and off as well as activating your phone's features (in my case voice dial redial etc.) and one button for volume. One unfortunate gripe I have with the 925 is that it only has one volume button (as opposed to two rocker style buttons for up and down) and three volume settings. There is no fine tuning the volume on this unit and it suffers in the form of calls that are too quiet on the road or too loud at home.The battery life was rather good for this headset. In 27 days of continuous use (about a half hour each day) I've only had to charge the unit + charging case twice. That is fantastic considering that I carried it with me everywhere I went.PERFORMANCESadly call performance the only thing that really matters in a bluetooth headset was lacking. The initial quality on calls is decent in a quiet room. In fact even in my car on city streets it was ok. However any kind of direct noise from wind just crippled with unit. Further to the point when the SoundIQ processor engages to remove background noise (like freeway road noise or especially wind) the volume on the other end of the call (e.g. the person I'm talking to) fluctuates terribly. Almost everyone I talked to said that my voice faded in and out like I was getting further and closer to the microphone over and over again. As soon as I got into a relatively quiet environment this effect stopped. This is a deal-breaker. Too many people complained of being unable to hear me properly due to this close-far effect.VERDICTI really wanted to like this headset. I got a fantastic price (more than 75% off retail) from Amazon and the convenience of the charging/carrying case was just too good to pass up. However in the end I just can't get around the poor call quality for the people I call.Pros- Modern/svelte design convenient charging/carrying case great battery lifeCons- Consistently terrible call quality on the receiving end of phone calls no ear loop option for people with sensitive inner ears3/5 stars
2	I bought this to match my car however as soon as it was out of the warranty from amazon it broke. I had to contact the manufacturer and it was going to cost me over twenty dollars to send it to them and then I had to wait 6-8 weeks for it to return or one that is of the same value. Which they could not guaranty would be gold. So I have it here somewhere for me to look at occasionally :(
2	The Plantronics Voyager Pro+ would hold it's charge for at least two weeks. It would go so long without needing to be charged that I would often lose the charger because I couldn't remember where I last left it (car or my room).This one loses its charge within 5 days. I couldn't figure it out because I thought the case would recharge it while it was in the case. But then I realized how much smaller this unit is compared to the Voyager Pro.Smaller unit = smaller battery = smaller up time.
2	It took me about a week to get used to the bluetooth not having a divice hanging on my ear.  But once that was working ok I loved the bluetooth.  That was until last week when it stopped receiving.  people could hear me but I could not hear them (not good).  The problem started a couple of weeks before by cutting out some of the reception and transmission.  I won't purchase another one.  I probably should have rated it even lower but it was so good at first that I just couldn't do it.This is my fourth bluetooth in the past two years.  I am at a loss of what to do at this time.  Looking again. Want something that is comfortable on my ear and I can transmit and receive clearly.
2	I bought this headset a little over a month ago for use strictly while I'm driving. I don't know about you but I'm always annoyed by people who stroll around Wal-Mart talking on their headset and I don't want to be THAT person! If I had to do it all over again I would buy a different headset but this one isn't so bad that I would take it back or buy a new one.Anyway here is my list of the good and the bad:THE GOOD:1. Sound quality is awesome. I can hear everyone else loud and clear and when I ask them they say they can hear me just fine (that's the most important feature!).2. Pairing is easy - but isn't it easy for virtually every headset?3. It is incredibly light and kinda stylish looking.4. The charging case is awesome. It makes it easy to carry around without worrying about damaging it.5. I've had mine for a month and I've only had to bring it inside to charge it once (I leave it in the charging case in the console of my car 90% of the time).6. The large multi-function button is easy to find and press. I didn't think it was a big deal until I tried to use my wife's headet that has a much smaller button.THE BAD:1. It is uncomfortable. I have pretty small ears and even with the small ear gel it is uncomfortable. If it sits in my ear for longer than 10-15 minutes I have to swap it to the other ear because it starts to hurt. I've browsed the internet for 3rd party ear gels that might be more comfortable but have yet to find one. I've tried all different types of positions and the most comfortable one is still not comfortable.2. It really needs an ear hook to hold it in place. It often starts to droop down towards the bottom of my jawline and that's while I'm sitting still driving in my car. The one time I walked around with it in my ear I had to reposition it at least once a minute.3. The push button volume thing is kinda stupid. Even the cheaper headsets have a more advanced volume control.4. Plantronics customer service is quite possibly the worst I've ever encountered. When I got the headset I tried all the features and found the voice dial wasn't working. After browsing the internet and trying everything I could think of I called Plantronics tech support. He had a tone of Why the heck are you bothering me the entire time. After I explained everything to him he said the device was faulty and I needed to return it. I paid shipping to return it and when I got my replacement headset the voice dial still wasn't working. I eventually found out that my phone - iPhone - doesn't support bluetooth voice dialing. Shouldn't the tech guy think to ask me that? Due to his idiocy I had to spend money returning the device.My wife has a Jabra 4010 headset that costs less than half the price of the Plantronics Discovery 925 and I wish I had gotten that one instead. It's MUCH more comfortable and the few times I've used it the sound quality on both ends was just as good as the Plantronics.
2	Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece (Black)[Retail Packaged]Finally received a working one on the third replacement. First came in D.O.A. second worked but blue indicator light did not function. Thanks to Amazing AMAZON both defective pieces returned with out hassel and replacements arrived the next day. Were it not for Amazon I would have given up after the first DOA. So far unit works well sound is very good and comfort not bad. AMAZON you are the BEST.
2	I've had this earpiece for a month now and am very disappointed with it. Yes it looks sleek and neat - and I was very happy with my prior Plantronics Voyager 510 headset BUT -It is one of the most uncomfortable earpieces I've ever had. I was just on a call of 28 minutes and my ear hurts. I cannot put the unit back on my ear now because of the pain it causes. I've tried adjusting the gel tried different gels but can't find any combination that doesn't hurt my ear after being on for a moderate period of time.The instructions that come with the unit are sparse and inadequate.And the unit itself is fragile - mine will already need to be exchanged/warranty returned: now when I put any pressure on it (pushing it in my ear or pushing the control button or even touching it) it starts making a horrible static-y tone-y loud background noise. Sometimes the noise stops when the finger is moved away - other times it stays and I have to switch to using the handset because it's impossible to hear the caller with the added interference.There are a couple of good points for this product though:1) The sound going into the mic is fed back to the earpiece - So for example if it's windy you'll know whether you're sending wind noise to the caller. When I'm riding my bike I find that I can turn my head slightly and eliminate/substantially reduce wind noise. With a headset that doesn't feedback your audio you have no idea of the noise you are sending.2) The leather carrycase/charger is nice esp since I wouldn't wear any bluetooth all the time. It protects the unit and makes it easy to put in a pocket. HOWEVER - it is NOT easy to seat into the charging plug and I think that the case being a charger may reduce the life of the internal battery of the earpiece when it is frequently moved in and out of the case (and consequently frequently partially charged/discharged).The discomfort and poor performance/durability makes me regret the purchase.
2	This is a very well designed unit for placement in my ear - multiple choices on ear piece to fit ear size and great sound. As I wear glasses the over the ear type was not very comfortable. However the darned 925's keep failing. I'm returning my 3rd one and frankly I'm fed up with it. Plantronics is fantastic in their acceptance of returns through their on-line process and they even will give me a Voyager 520 instead of replacing again the Discovery 925 I'm returning. I really don't recommend it for the reason that it's unrealiable and I have to wait for a replacement using the old wire connected ear pieces. Very disappointing.
2	In general I am quite pleased with the audio performance of the 925 and the charging carrying case is nice but I have some issues with the mechanical design.First the V boom is somewhat long and when I'm carrying it in my pocket it kind of pokes around and makes carrying it around rather inconvenient other than when it's in your ear. Basically if you are not wearing it it's kind of hard to find a good place to put it.What has turned out to be more annoying for me is the type of rubber in the eargels. Maybe it's just my particular skin oils but after about two weeks the gels absorb oil from my skin and get rather slippery. As a result the gels start to spin around on the headset and don't stay in my ear as well. I have tried washing them with soap and water but after about 2 months of doing this the gels seem to lose their shape and just spin rather loosely on the speaker post. Maybe it's just me but I've never had to wash the eargels for my BT headsets before.The connection and audio performance are just fine but the eargel issue is bugging me enough that I'm going to try a new headset after 9 months. Every other headset I've had I've been able to use for over a year.
2	There are plenty of wonderful things to say about this headset - it is pretty it holds a charge and the sound quality is fantastic. I use mine with my iPhone and switched over from the Mac bluetooth. I didn't like my old one because it didn't hold a charge and the sound quality was just iffy.But here's the problem for me with this new earpiece - it hurts! It's fine for a short time but then my ear hurts. I  did try the various sized plastic thingys - but I felt like Goldilocks trying to find the perfect fit. One was too small one was too big and the one that I thought was just right hurts like heck after an hour or so.In all though I am glad I have it and it's perfect if you are in a crowded place and need to hear clearly. It's also got a convenient recharger that fits in my purse that will recharge the piece one time. (You then need to recharge that recharger.)Great product just wish it was more comfortable.
2	Worked fine with my BB Curve but drove people crazy when I swithed to the Tour. Poor sound quality. Now using Jawbone with better sound results.
2	Let me start by saying I LOVE Plantronics products.  Years ago when I used to sell electronics I would always push their products (I did not receive a commission) because they were far superior in sound quality than any other brand out there.  I am the type of person who will spend extra money on something that works well as opposed to something cheap that is not up to the same level of quality.  Here is my review of each aspect of the product:Size/Weight: First this product is very very light weight. When I first took the headset out of the package and held it I thought it was cheap feeling because it was so light but after thinking about it for a moment I realized I would much rather have it feel light and cheap than heavy and weighing down my ear.  Overall I am extremely happy with this aspect of the headset.Comfort:  The weight of the product and the gel-ish inserts made the product fit comfortably in my ear.  I wore the product for lengthy periods and never felt any significant level of discomfort.  Overall I am impressed by the aspect of this headset.Style: First I do not rock a fanny pack for a reason and in my opinion most Bluetooth headsets remind me of fanny packs and black socks with sandals.  They are a fashion oh heck no. However this particular headset is a nice inconspicuous size.  The gap between the two bars that make up the mouthpiece make the headset look better and less bulky.  Additionally the mouthpiece is fairly short and does not overtake your face as you talk.  Overall I am extremely happy with this aspect of the headset as I do not want to look like something out of a SciFi movie when chatting on the phone.Syncing with my Bluetooth device:  I have never synced any Bluetooth device to my current cell phone.  The process took under 30 seconds before they were paired together.  The instructions were crystal clear and I did not need my phone's manual to figure anything out.  This aspect of the headset worked amazing.And here's where it all went wrong...Sound Quality (Outgoing):  Let me start by saying yes I did have the mouthpiece directed in the way indicated by the Plantronics manual.  Also my phone was sitting right next to me so this was not a matter of being too far away from my cell phone.  I spoke to dozens of people on the headset over the course of five days all of whom asked What was that?  Could you repeat that?  Huh?  etc.  Most of the time I would have to disconnect the headset and go old-fashioned by actually using my hands.  When I needed to put the air conditioning on it was impossible for the other party to hear me due to the wind noise so I had to shut my vents so I could be (somewhat)heard.  Even when there was no background noise of any sort (music airconditioning passenger noise) the product failed in this area.  Every person I spoke to complained.  Overall I would rate this aspect of the headset almost unusable.Sound Quality (Incoming): Everyone I spoke to sounded distant unclear and not loud enough to hear well (yes ALL volumes were at the maximum level).  Often I would try to shove the headset deeper in my ear hoping it would help however this would cause me to accidentally hit the call end button and hang up on the person I was speaking to.  After two times of doing that I learned my lesson and just strained to hear the best I could.  Overall I would rate this aspect of the headset almost unusable.One star is the minimum Amazon lets a user rate a product.  I gave the rating one extra star because had the outgoing/incoming quality been excellent there would be no better Bluetooth product on the market right now because of size weight comfort style and ease of syncing.
0	I had this bluetooth for four days.  It worked perfect paired easily and sounded great.Then all of a sudden it just stopped working.  It wouldn't recharge wouldn't turn on...it did nothing.
2	The headsetrelies entriely on sticking in hour ear; there is nothing aroundthe earlobe or the head to stabilize it.A stiff wind or a yawn can easilty make it fall. To carry it in yoour pocket you have two choices. Putit in the leather box with is bulky for most pockets but carries an auxiliry battery The other choice is to carry it loose in the pocket. When you do that latter it comes on just from getting joggled in the pocket. If you loose the outer box they get you 2/3s of the price of the whole unit to replace it. I am now looking for anoterheadset with a looparond the earlobe and a more positive off switch.
0	FIRST I READ THE REVIEWS OF BOTH THE M1100 AND THE 925 BY PLANTRONICS. I BELIEVE ALL THOSE 5 STAR REVIEWS ARE FAKE. AND FOR ME AND AMAZON. IF I SEE OVER 5 BAD REVIEWS THEN ITS A BAD  DEVICE COMING FROM AMAZON.. I bought the M1100 first it was full of static during my conversation.  I sent it back the same day i bought it.. Amazon gave me a gift card for a refund. so i ordered the 925. THIS ONE WAS WORST THEN THE M1100. THIS BLUETOOTH HOLD STATIC WITHOUT BEING ON THE PHONE. I JUST GOT IT IN LIKE FIVE MINUTES AGO. I WILL ALSO BE SENDING THIS ONE BACK..... EVERYONE IS GROWN SO YOU ALL ARE GOING TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. ALL IM SAYING IS DONT BE DUMB AND WASTE A LOT OF TIME..... THE REVIEWS HAVE TO BE FAKE... I ORDERED BOTH THE M1100 AND THE 925 PLANTRONICS.. IF YOU LOVE STATIC IN YOUR EAR THEN THESE TWO ARE FOR YOU....
0	When I plugged it into my computer the whole computer turned off. When it powered on I received this message from the BIOS: USB device over current status detected and it shutdown after 15 seconds. I'm running a self-built computer with an over 900W power supply and I only had 1 other USB device connected.Out of curiosity I tried it in another USB port (on the back) - same result. Also the same result in my Toshiba laptop. I also tried it in a USB wall charger I have and it produced an electric arc. Obviously it doesn't work. I'm just glad it didn't damage any of my hardware.See if you can find a better quality product - this one is junk.
2	I purchased this cable so that I could connect my cell phone (LG CU515) to my computer and download pictures from it.  The cable itself works fine. However be aware that it won't do any good to have this cable if you also don't have software to take the pictures music etc. from your phone and transfer it to your computer. I'm unfamiliar with the technological lingo but apparently without such software your phone and computer can't talk to each other. The cable includes software but it comes on a mini-disc that doesn't work without an adapter or a computer that will specifically read & load mini-discs. So the cable itself is great but it's virtually worthless (and probably the reason for the incredibly cheap price) without proper software.
2	MY MOM NEEDED A NEW BATTERY AND I BOUGHT IT FOR HER. IT SEEMS TO DO THE JOB SO HAPPY WITH MY BUY
2	I bought a battery for my Motorola phone because the 15 month old battery wasn't holding a charge. The new battery arrived quickly (good vendor) and the price was significantly better than the local Verizon dealer (good value). However this is my 4th personal Motorola phone (5th when you add in business phones) and despite following a careful charging process as instructed by my phone dealer the batteries have never lasted very long.This purchase will get me to my new every two date when I plan after many years with the brand to switch away from Motorola.I'm not happy about having to do that but with the history of the poor battery life with my 4 phones and my wife's 2 Motorola I will go to another brand.I hope someone from Motorola reads this and sees the impact of their poor service on a loyal customer's purchase decision.
2	Replacement for the original battery which was defective -- lasts literally 2 days with  my average use (about 30 minutes of talking).  This one lasts about 5 days which is a lot better but still worse than my Samsung which I charge only one per week without about 30 minutes of talk time.
2	Most manufacturers are only required to manufacture and supply parts for their products for about 7 years which is the statute of limitations. After this period of time the challenge is yours as to whether to dump your old but good cell phone and get ripped off by buying a new one in our disposable society.Manufacturers drive their revenue stream by creating this type of planned obsolescence. The lure of more bells and whistles provides an enticement for buying new.  However I still like to have the choice of simply buying a new battery for a cell phone that otherwise works great.  Unfortunately I have discovered that you need to be very careful when attempting to purchase an LG OEM 1100mAh battery described as new.  Here are the facts before you buy:1. LG ceased manufacturing these cells back in 2007. Too bad LG didn't tell us that!  This means that any batteries described as new by vendors are at least 5 years old or greater and have been sitting in warehouses.2. Before you buy recognize that you will NOT be receiving a new cell-only one that has been tested but may not hold its charge at full capacity for the same period of time that a freshly manufactured cell would under normal operating conditions.3. If purchasing insist that the merchant/vendor sends you only the latest production date on the cell and is honest in communicating this information to you.-Each LG OEM 1100mAh cell has a production date under the UPC code on the back of each battery.  (For example DC071013 indicates that the cell was manufactured on October 13 2007).4. I purchased several of these cells from different vendors over the past few years and have discovered that they may not disclose this to you unless you ask. They are old cells and this explains why they are discounting them substantially. My experiences suggest that they do not retain their charge for more than 1-2 days.  Please take this into consideration before you purchase.5. Remember....New means different things to different folks.  To vendors new simply means that the battery has never been used.  To most purchasers new implies that it has been recently manufactured and can be expected to retain a full charge pursuant to fresh cell standards. Don't fall for a PHONE-Y pitch!Good Hunting!
2	Well I bought the battery cause mine was almost 2 yrs old in my phone so when I got this battery and put it in my phone turned my phone off to charge it it had a full charge but without doing anything on the phone for a few hours the battery went down. I have better luck with my old battery.
0	The battery arrived within the time frame for shipping and was well packaged.The first visible difference between this and the original is that the cell for this one was made in China; the original was made in Korea.The original was solid while this one had a seam around the bottom and one could see some of the battery's contents starting to leak there already.  The manufacture code of DC061128 (November 28 2006) means that the battery is over 5 years old.The battery did come with a full charge but a battery that's already leaking isn't going to be used in my phone.  Since the cost was nominal it's not worth bothering to return it.Rating: D
0	This headset does not cancel outside sound. It also isn't very loud and broke broke a couple days after I got it. Very cheaply made!
0	Update: As other reviews state - the thing will snap in 2 with normal use. DON'T BUY THIS! While it sounds great it will break with normal use after a short while. Samsung's warranty doesn't cover the obviously defective design - well someone should sue them because the language in the written warranty covers DEFECTS and this surely is a defect if you see how many people have had this problem!Since Samsung won't stand behind it - I'm boycotting ALL Samsung products - there you go!And here's what I did to repair them:Gorilla Glue: this is really good glueA piece of flexible metal - looked around my parts box and found some sort of bracket - strip of thing metal and I cut it as it was a bit big. Bent it to cover the top and bottom of the band and gorilla-glued it. After 24hrs put black duct tape around the repair job and it's lasted several months. I actually cut off a small part of the broken band near where it snapped because I have a thin face and wanted a slightly tighter/snugger fit - and that's what I've got now.The headphones are still uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour or so as others have said as they dig into the ears but I do like them for the gym and around the home as a bluetooth headset for voice calls with my phone. Just can't wear them for more than hour at a time.[Final?] Update - Sep 2010: They keep breaking in new places. After the sixth break in the headband today I've given up trying to repair it. So I found a pair of headphones that I no longer use (traditional over-the-head band) and took the earpieces off. Used Gorilla Glue to blue the Samsung earpieces on. Now the fit and comfort issues are gone - and they won't break again either. But the cable between the 2 earpieces isn't long enough - so right now I put that behind my head... I am thinking of cutting the wire in 2 and splicing/sodering a piece of cable in so they can go around the band over-the-head - altho will require some skill as the wires inside the cable are very very thin.
0	Units - 2 of them- would not sync or work with any of my laptops. Returned them via Amazon printed UPS label over 7 weeks ago. Still wating on a refund. Amazon says they cant refund the charge only the merchant.Guess I will have to file a dispute with AMX.
2	It appears this phone is being sold as a new phone when it fact I believe it's been refurbished.  Opened box to find a phone that had different colored part in blue.  The back and flip portion of phone was a different blue from rest of phone.  Also phone was just bouncing around loose in box - no internal packing.  Back piece of phone along with battery and charger were also loose in box.  The phone was not the quality as advertised.
0	DONT BUY IT. WASTE OF YOUR MONEY. The back cover kept coming out. I did not know what to do so I sent it back but never got the money back. What a waste of my time and money.
2	I used to have this phone long time ago  I bought this for my dad but the only problem I had is its hard to hear when you call someone over the phone I cant hear them. its ok for the people like basic cell phone.
0	Nice looking phone.If the phone has any problems the motorola agents are unavailable to help in any way except to offer to maybe repair it if sent in for more than the cost of an unlocked version.Find a company that supports its products that either is number one or wants to be.  If you want an android there are several companies that are HUNGRY for your biz.  Motorola is not.
2	Bought this phone to use as a business phone - just for calls and messages.  It lasted about 6 months.
0	RECIEVED ON TIME BACK COVER WAS BROKEN ASKED FOR ANOTHER ONE AND THEY SENT ME A PINK COVER SERIOUSLY WTH THE THE HONE IT SELF STOP WORKING WITHIN A FEW WEEKS HORRIBLE DONT WWASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ITH THESE PEOPLE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.
0	My mom missed having a RAZR phone and I got this for her. But when I got it I was excited but after opening it I realized how cheaply put together it was and it just felt so brittle in my hands. I don't recommend this unless you like having a crappy cheap phone or just for a backup.
0	I am going to return phone it will not stay charged for more than an hour that's the only problem so far but unable to use for extended time to see if there are any other issues.
2	I used to have this phone long time ago  I bought this for my uncle but the only problem I had is its hard to hear when you call someone over the phone I cant hear them. its ok for the people like basic cell phone.
0	I've used many iGo products and this is the first one to disappoint.  It doesn't fit in the 12v outlet (cigarette lighter) as well as it should and it comes loose all the time.  So my devices run out of charge when I think they've been charging.So this product fails at it's one purpose:  to charge stuff.I still love iGo products and I'm still very happy with the other iGo 12v chargers I own--just not this one.
2	In case of emergencies having this handy is defnitely a life saver. Do not forget to turn the Off switch when not in use else all the battery is discharged in vain.Says it would charge an 1pod 2.5 times - sorry it charges abt 50-60% once thats all.Also it is not really universal - you may still need to carry your cell phone charger + the Duracell charger cables. That's a bit cumbersome. Overall helpful at least when you are out of battery & no other way to charge while traveling for instance.
2	I'm a biker and I bought this to charge my G1 Android and/or Motorola Android Backflip phone on the road when the batteries died and I had no access to a wall or cigarette charger outlet. If the battery in either of these phones completely discharges you can get ONE and only one full charge on either phone if you power off the phone and let it charge.  If you need to leave the phone on during the charging you can get about a %75 recharge. This is very useful but any idea of getting more than one full recharge on a smart phone is not realistic.  In order to recharge the Duracell unit you'll need access to a wall powered outlet for about 3-5 hours. This thing can be a lifesaver just don't expect it to carry you through a cross country trip with a full charge on your phone.
2	This gadget does what it tries to do but the price has been dropping because what it tries to do isn't enough most people these days.  The power rating for this gadget is 1100mAh which is fine if you have a basic cell phone or MP3 player.  Modern smartphones have a battery rating of 1400mAh and up so this thing can top off a half-discharged battery but it won't fully recharge a dead battery.  If a half charge is enough to get you through the rest of your day then this product may be a good value for you.  If you want more power there are lots of similar products with a lot more power but for more money and a little bigger size.On the other hand almost all modern smartphones (other than Apple) have replaceable batteries and a spare battery is a lot less bulky than this thing.  Either way you have to remember to keep the spare charged and ready to go.
2	These are better than basic normal earbuds but if you play anything with bass the sound gets overblown and distorted.  Highs and mid-range are good however so if you don't listen to very thumpy music these will sound fairly good.The noise-reducing capability was kind of a disappointment; it isn't as good as I had hoped for.  I can easily hear the people around me talking and make out their conversations even when the earphones make a very good seal in my ears.To anyone who has troubles getting a good seal: you can follow the usual steps below for putting earplugs in.1. Hold the earplug in your right hand.2. With your left hand reach over or behind your head and grip the top of your right ear pulling upward while you open your jaw slightly.3. Put the earphone in then let go of your ear.4. Swap sides and put in the left earplug.You might look a little silly when doing it but it will give you a much tighter seal.  Once you get the idea down you will be able to do it all with one hand (e.g. use a couple fingers in your right hand to pull up on your right ear while lowering your jaw and using your index finger and thumb to push the right earphone into your ear).These would be okay for twenty-five bucks or less but not seventy.Update: after 3 years of occasional light use (avg less than once a month) the right earbud stopped working. I never did get them to stay in 100% reliably even  by inserting them earplug-style. I usually had to stop 3 or 4 times to re-insert them when mowing the lawn.
2	I bought this item because I needed something to use when it's cold outside.  Also I needed a product that would help me with my carpal tunnel issues.This product isn't that great.  It takes a little bit of pressure to get the device to respond.  It also hurts my hands after just a bit of use.  Therefore I don't use it that often.There are times when it works well but it's not all the time.  If you want to try it it was cheap enough but you'll do better using your fingers.
2	This is a great stylus if you're only going to use it for typing or navigating around your device.  I purchased it for the ipad and I've tried it on my Blackberry Storm 2 and both devices respond well to it however when I tried using it in the Application Penultimate for ipad....the response time and strokes were off. Some of the strokes didn't even appear.  It doesn't do well with handwritten notes.  It also doesn't do well with more complicated sketches where you need to work with some fine lines.  If you want to just doodle then it's great for that but I'm a graphic designer and when I'm brainstorming I need a little more precision so I probably won't use this stylus for anything graphics related.  The tip of the stylus is really spongy and it looks and feels more like the material used to make eye shadow applicators lol.  I have a feeling that the tip may wear down very easily so it's a good idea to have more than one on hand.  I'm going to keep it but I went ahead and purchased a Dagi Stylus to see if that one would be better for me.  I think the Dagi is more of what I'm looking for in stylus.  Google Dagi Stylus and you'll see what I'm talking about.  It has a lot more precision.
2	I liked it but it really wore out too quickly. For the price it's a good little stylus.  Has nice sensitivity and while it was new it was my favorite.
0	If you check my reviews on Amazon.com I have hundreds.  Not ONE of them despite my traumatic experiences with a few have ever received one star.That's changing today.I just received the stylus and was stoked to try it on Sketchbook Mobile.  As soon as I turned on my iPhone I though What the heck; let's try it on the menu screen to navigate to the app.  I pushed the stylus gently and nothing work.  I pushed a little harder and that seemed to get the iPhone working.  I opened Sketchbook but nothing happened.  I pressed harder and still nothing.  I then pushed even harder and tried to draw and the stupid stylus scratched my screen.  It's a little nick on my screen protector so I'm not too worried.I did read that you have to push harder to get it working if you have a screen protector but I pushed all the way and no result was shown.I'm returning the stylus a.s.a.p. to Amazon.com.My guess is that this will be my only one-star review--ever.  I read the others precautionary reviews but thought I was the exception.I was wrong.
2	I bought this thing assuming it would work on all capacitive screens.  Apparently that was a misguided assumption on my part.  I attempted to use it on a Viewsonic gTablet.  There is no way I can get this thing to drag a screen shot up down or sideways.  I have a RooCase ultra mini which works really great.  I wanted something a tad larger than the RooCase that's is why I ordered this thing.  Bad decision.
0	This stylus is very cheap quality and you have press harder on the screen to use it with an iphone or ipod. You get what you pay.Don't waste your time and money.
2	After I ordered the Pogo stylus I learned from several Youtube videos that you can build these yourself for pennies.  So while the Pogo was on its way to me I did just that.  The review of the Pogo follows but I need to mention the do-it-yourself version first.  Being an Engineer I happened to have a bunch of the carbon foam that micro-chips are shipped in which is the exact same material the Pogo uses.If you hold the foam and brush it against your iPhone iPad etc it works beautifully.  So I tried shaping a piece of the foam into a ball and attached it to the end of a plastic pen.  It didn't work.  No movement at all from the cursor.  You see the foam completes an electrical circuit between your body and the touchscreen which is why the barrel of the Pogo is metal.On Youtube I saw various methods for creating a metal barrrel.  The most intresting is to use a segment of a telescoping antenna.  The only thing I had lying around was an X-acto knife so I unscrewed and removed the blade from the barrel and stuffed the foam inside the barrel hole.  Viola!  It stays in place perfectly and I was able to shape the foam tip into a rounded ball.Now the reason I mention all of this is NOT to share my arts and crafts skill.  When I got my Pogo I noticed that I had to push it really hard against the screen to get a consistent response.  If you lightly brush it it will NOT respond well.  Others have said the same thing.However my homemade version with the X-acto barrel works like a champ.  Very light touches work consistently.  I wonder if the brushed finish of the Pogo has any coating that is acting as an insulator.  The X-acto barrel is pure cold metal and I imagine it is a much better conductor.So even not comparing the Pogo to my home-made version I find the Pogo to be not worth the money.  it requires too hard of a contact for my comfort.  I know that eventually the foam tip will lose its spring-feel and I would be scraping the metal of the Pogo barrel against my iPhone.The idea behind the product is great.  Hopefully Pogo will come out with a version that has a better conducting barrel.  Until then I highly recommend going to Radio Shack and buying the cheapest IC they have - just for the packing material.  Make your own stylus and I bet yours will work better than the Pogo too.
0	This was supposed to work with my phone but it doesn't. Do not purchase this product if you have an LG GU295 slider phone. It may be cheap and uses micro usb but it wont work with the phone.
2	Item was described as compatible with &#34;HTC&#34; when it should have specified it may not be compatible with 'Newer HTC Smartphones' such as the DROID DNA which gives you an error that the unit is a slow charger and should not be used with the DNA.In any event Amazon as ALWAYS cares about the satisfaction of the Customer and gladly refunded my purchase with free return of the unit!....which makes me a Happy Camper to shop for a more fitting Car Charger in Amazon!!!
0	Do not buy.  Threw ours away.  It overheats when plugged in to the point where it is hard to touch it.
2	works good for a while then eventually  stops working  i guess you get what you pay for lasted me a while before it broke
2	I bought 4 of these because they are cheep and my girlfriend tends to destroy the wire by yanking on it.  The only issue I have with these specific chargers vs ones that I got in the past is that they don't seem to be held together as well so I'm a little worried they will actually fall apart before she breaks them.
2	The cable itself works but the entire point of buying a retractable cable is that well it retracts. The cable rarely retracts on its own you have to push the button pull and release a bunch of times until most of it retracts and then tap on the charger repeatedly to unbind the spring inside so it will retract the rest of the cable. I won't be buying this brand again.
0	I loved everthing about this headset until it stopped working less than 3 weeks after I received it.  I am very disappointed because I threw away the box and now I have nothing.  When it worked it was fantastic and stylish.  Very disappointed.
0	This headset was purchased for my wife.  The biggest problem with it was that after a few months It wouldn't hold a charge.  We tried everything to get it to work right but to no avail.  We finally gave up & just disposed of it.
2	These suck.  Pure and simple.  The reason is that they are terribly uncomfortable and unbalanced.  Forget wearing them for day to day use because if you have a collar...whether it be a shirt or jacket or whatever these will drive you nutz.  You will walk around like a zombie trying not to knock the back.  Always wear t-shirts?  Yea maybe they'll work but even when they're not knocking around ur collar they are still uncomfortable with the imbalance of weight.  Maybe they're work well for the gym but other reviews say the slightest amount of sweat or water will destroy them...i dunno about that because i never got past the first day or two.  Buy at ur own risk...but i would wait.  They seem to be almost there but not quite yet with this product.
0	I've purchesed the S9 from Volume Cellular and received the item as promissed. in few days of usage the device started to have problems with the controlls. within a week the device was DEAD! I contacted the seller and advised of the situation the seller was very helpful in providing assistance and options including refund. Even I had encountered some problem when returning the device through UPS the seller promply refunded my money upon receival.  As I stated earlyer Greater service bad product from motorola!! Maybe just my bad luck on this device.  Well buy again from the seller just not another S9 head set.
2	Bought this item from Amazon and as always it came quickly and undamaged.  Nice price.Pros:* design and thoughtfulness* bass of the sound* volume level -- can get really loud!* price and value* handsfree hassle free...when it works* pairs quickly and easily with iPhone 3GsCons:* bulk packaging did not include an instruction manual.  oy.* really good acoustic coupling means can hurt ears after a while* most of the fancy controls you really want don't really work.  Althoughthis may be just a defective unit the message boards are full ofevidence of very flaky controls on the S9.* idiotic decision by either Apple or (more likely) Moto that phone callsshould only come into one ear.  kind of defeats the purpose of stereoheadphones.
0	I was looking for a discrete bt earphone that worked OK. The important thing was portability and being discrete - not to look like a nerd on the streets.My objective was to listen to podcasts... not too worried about sound quality.Well the only thing that needed to work right was the blue-tooth transmission.... and it doesn't !! It works only inside my home and inside my car. When I'm on the street it doesn't work anymore (I live in a big city with lots of radio interference). I have to bring my phone really close to the earphone in order for the BT to work without interruption.When I say it doesn't work = the music plays for 2 seconds and pauses for 2 seconds then plays a bit more and pauses a bit more... it's not just bad connection and noise. It just stops transmitting altogether.The funny thing is that for phone conversations it does work anywhere. But when I'm listening to music or a podcast it doesn't. I think that the stereo mode takes on more bandwidth and requires a better transmission rate.... not possible with the interference... whatever the reason - it's worthless unless you are in an interference-free zone.Ahhh.. the fitting. Not good. I have a big head and even for me the earphone has a loose fitting. I need to press it against my ears with my hands for it to be snug-fitting and easier to hear.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!I used an HTC Tytn II phone with windows mobile 6.0 to try this product.
0	Awful product!  When I first received it the Skip/Back function did not work and I could not skip tracks from the headset as advertised.  The volume was very low even at maximum device and headseat volume levels.  If the headset was exposed to even a little moisture it either: randomly increased or decreased the volume (with an insane beep every 1/2 second) or stopped functioning altogether.  This made the headphones useless for jogging/workouts or yard work - even a little bit of sweat screwed it up.  The rubber ear pieces fell off after the third use.  Finally the range is horrible - unit cut out constantly while my cell phone was in its holster on my waist.  I had to wear an arm holster so the unit would be in range.  When I compare this 2 foot range to the 40+ foot range of another Bluetooth device these headphones don't measure up.  I suppose it would be suitable for sleeping with your phone next to you on the bedstand (and you do not sweat while you sleep!)...  Thank goodness it was only $50 on here instead of the $100 they were asking at retail stores.
2	I got these as a wireless option that I could use with my computer or with my phone (Moto Q).  They have worked well with both and have about a 3 hour battery life which is good for work because it goes for about half the day then I can charge them during lunch. The problem is that I can't keep them on that long because they press on my ears were the ear bud sits.  They came with three sets for ear pads but they are all hard and none seem to relieve the pressure.  There are instructions for stretching them to fit but no matter what I do they go back to being tight.  I usually leave them on stretched around the box they came in so they don't press so hard in the morning but it would be a lot nicer if they actually could be bent to fit your head.
2	First the goods:- stereo sound is very good (for a wireless device);- comfort is good except there are no alternate size speaker cups in the bulk package. So if these are too large for you - you are out of luck because it is almost impossible to get a replacement elsewhere.  In terms of comfort these would be perfect for a gym except...The bads:- the set looses a connection to the BT source at a mere turn of your head!This flakiness is more than an inconvenience - for me it rendered this otherwise almost perfect device absolutely useless so I end up returning it.  I tried it with two sources: my Blackberry and a laptop with a BT transmitter.  The laptop transmitter is pretty powerful: with my other headphone (also by Motorola by the way HT820) I can walk around the house even go on a top floor without loosing the connection.But with this set I lost the connection every time I turned my head or raised my arm.  And what's the deal with the replacement cups?  There is a link to an accessory site in the manual.  The site is useless - nothing at all!About the bulk packaging: it's fine except you don't really know if you are getting a new item or a return (I suspect the latter). Also the retail package comes with an alternate size set of speaker cups bulk package doesn't have them.
0	This was bought for use while jogging and it only works half the time.  Very difficult to use consistently and definitely a regret buying since I'd rather have paid more for something more dependable.
0	I would NOT purchase this product off of the internet.  I ordered one recieved it and it wouldn't even register that it was charging so I didn't get to test it.  I called Amazon and they were great.  The representative was kind and he quickly sent me a replacement item overnight.  I opened that one up and it did charge.  I had some trouble pairing it with my phone but it did eventually do that.  Then I tried to use it.  When I put it in the on position it turned off.  When I put it in the off position it turned on.  I even took it to a brick and mortar store to make sure I wasn't missing something.  I did purchase one from that store the H710 the next model up and I have to say that I do like it.  It works great and is very comfortable on my ear.  There also seems to be a bit of a quality discrepency between the two virtually identical items.The one I purchased at the store is a lot less plasticky than the one I ordered on-line.  It just seems less-than-coincidental that i recieved two in a row that were malfunctioning significantly.
2	Not much more to say. I too received the wrong charger a Slim travel charger rated at 750mA with non-folding AC prongs as others have pointed out.Amazon Customer Service immediately approved the return and it is on its way back.Pity about the faulty listing serviced by Amazon Kudos on the (as always) great service.I'll walk into a Verizon store and buy the real thing I guess.
2	I am still searching for a charger that will charge my old Motorola K1m KRZR.  I still have a FMP5202A to use but have been looking for a backup as well as one that allows me to plug in my choice of USB cables.  So far anything other than a PC with the Moto USB drivers loaded or the FMP5202A gives me the &#34;Unauthorized Charger&#34; error message and fails to charge.  I also tried a SPN5689A with no luck.Otherwise the charger will charge my Moto Atrix HD just fine but for that purpose I have much smaller and faster chargers available.  This charger will probably get thrown into the pile of useless electronics.  Looks like I will be trying the local thrift stores and possibly pawn shops to see if they have any of the old chargers laying around.
0	This charger does not charge rapidly it's just a normal charger.  It is also a very bulky top charger the bulkiest I've seen in years so it's hard to fit other things in the outlet or power strip next to it. Do your self a favor and skip it
0	i honestly didnt notice that my phone was charging faster....seems to me like its jus a regular phone charger...says motorolla but i dont know could be a fakey rip off...its workin just like a regular charger not impressed
0	This product did not work out of the box. Plugged it into a phone and a tablet. No go. Avoid.
0	I ordered this item as I already had 5 of the Motorola Mini-USB to Micro-USB that were working well from an earlier order with another company.  When this one arrived I noticed that two of my phones (a Droid Global 2 and an LG) would not work with these (I ordered 5 of these).  Both of the adapters are molded plastic with the ID SKN6252A.  The ones that work look just a little better built and are 97 mm versus the ones that don't work which are 85 mm.  Both have a hologram with the M trademark but I suspect the ones that do not work are counterfeit. At least they were cheap.
0	Being a Motorola I thought this would be really good but it didn't last but about two weeks before the connection started going bad.  I have to wiggle the micro usb end to keep the charging light on my phone.  I have other mini usb cords/chargers and I don't have a problem with them so it's not the port on my phone.
2	Charging via the adapter seems to be slower than normal. Not sure if adding this decreases the charge time or not but it seems so.
2	Like I said in another review: All mini USB's do not work for every charger for every cell phone.Case in point: I have my GPS with its car charger (USB). I figured that since my newer phone had a mini USB charge this USB to Mini USB Adapter will work for my phone (Sanyo Katana LX). Not! They must designed the power pins anyway they felt like because a mini USB power charger is NOT universal. I hear that by Oct. 2010 (in Europe at least) all cell phone will have a universal mini USB charging port - you should be able to charge them thru your computer and you'll never will have to throw your old charger away just because you got a new phone! Or you can charge your phone with your buddy's charger...no problem. A very sensible bright idea I should say!But we are not there yet!THE GOOD PART: The exchange went very smoothly and the people involved were helpful and understanding!!
2	Been they where from Motorola I assumed they would be reliable. After a while they don't fit we'll in the mini port side and won't charge unless you hold it in place . Kinda of disappointed
0	Don't waste your money on these because if they do work when u get them they will quickly break and/or mess up your phone if u try to use it while it's plugged in. It doesn't work at all if u try to use it with your computer to transfer data like photos etc. I'm very disappointed b/c I purchased 4 of these since we went from cell phones having the micro usb charger to the mini usb chargers & it seemed like such a waste to throw our old cords away. I knew i was taking a risk after looking at some of the reviews but i decided to chance it & struck out. My advice is not to even gamble on it working.
2	I used this cable as an adapter for my old regular-usb-phone charger.  The charger becomes quite warm probably due that it's not transferring all the energy across the adapter.  The adapter works kind of like a resistor which the charging end stays cool but warms up the head of the plug.  This is not an issue however.Note: check the size of area around the micro usb end of your device to make sure you have enough room to fit this adapter's head.  My Behold II phone has a barely big enough space.
2	I have purchased (usually from my cellular provider or retailer for about $1) and used several of these adapters with various devices over the past several years and EVERY single one of them has eventually failed.  The average life expectancy of these adapters for me has been about 6 to 9 months.  After the initial failure I've found that I can wrap or coil the cord around the device to maintain the angle or pressure on the connection - which works about 80-90% of the time.  I have no experience on how long this fix lasts as the inconvenience annoys me into replacing the defective adapter after a short time.I have not tested the data throughput rates with these so I have no comments on that... other than that they do allow you to transfer data via USB.Overall these have been good adapters... when they work - especially for the $1 each price I paid.  I just hesitate spending more than $1 each on these adapters given the short life I've experienced with them.  In my experience these adapters should rate the same life-expectancy as the Mini-USB cables they are attached to (or any other data cable for that matter... rated in years not months).
0	From all the reviews it seemed this little adapter was magic. However I tried it with multiple mini cables and chargers and none of them would allow me to charge by MiFi from Novatel.
0	I bought several of these and all of them stopped working within 2 weeks of receiving them.  I would have returned them but by the time I would have gone to the post office paid for postage and waited for them to come back it wasn't worth my time or money.  Don't buy.
2	I bought two of these.  The first one broke after a couple of months of infrequent use.  I'm using the second one now.  Shoddy quality.
0	The fit and materials were OK but some of the holes were cut so poorly as to look like someone did them with a pocket knife and there was a strip of silicone down one seam like the mold wasn't properly formed.  The result was that the appearance of the product was embarrassingly bad.  Save your money and go for one that is better made...perhaps made by RIM.
2	I'll start with the good. The case fits well. it feels good in your hand and still will slide in your pocket. The cutouts are all in the correct location. Now for the bad which to me is most important because obviously a case like this is not meant for protection of the phone because it is thin this case is meant for adding some color to your phone which is why I bought it to match with outfits and stuff. Well this is an ugly dull banana color its 'nothing' like the picture its not bold or bright at all. It looks faded and like it was left in the sun and all the color came out. very pale. I do not recommend this case to anyone. Maybe try another color because I have bought many cases and not had an issue like this before.
2	It's a decent case. It keeps my phone protected but it already broke and had to be superglued when I removed it for the first time to clean off my phone. Once glued back it's been fine again.
2	i was super excited to recieve this case but was disappointed when it arrived. the pattern is different than the one in the picture and its a very cheap feeling/looking case. i guess thats what you get for 5 bucks.
2	I do not like the feel of rubber in my hands. I had to go to hard cover even though purple is my favorite color.
2	Good enough of a cover to prevent a little of the typical wear-and-tear on your phone.  The power port opening is a little too snug and I have to be very careful when inserting the cord in because it has a tendency to slip out using this case. Aside from that it's good.
2	One of the known problems with theBlackBerry Storm 9530 Phone Black (Verizon Wireless)is that using Bluetooth voice-command dialing can lock up the phone requiring one or more reboots (remove the battery wait 15 seconds replace the battery and wait 4-6 minutes). Many of my Storm problems were resolved by a Verizon support tech who had me use a command to wipe the device and start over again. I thought I'd start clean and use this headset instead of my Motorola which is recommended by the Storm manual; the lock-up problem is better but the phone still locks up occasionally.This headset fits more securely than my oldMotorola H700 Bluetooth Headset but it takes considerably more pressure to press the control and there is a longer delay between pressing the control and getting any response on the Storm. However since it does seem to cause fewer lock-ups I'll continue to use this BlackBerry headset.
2	Blackberry HS-655+ Bluetooth Headset (Black):For the final price [...] after rebate this BT headset is a good value.Pros: Light-weight fits good in my ear sound quality is good although voices sound a little muffled.Cons:  Buttons are hard to press can be charged only in the special case that comes with it silly blue light that illuminates the main button.I find it very uncomfortable when I have to press and hold the main button to turn the 655+ on or to activate voice dialing because the strength required to operate the button pushes the headset into my ear canal.I am not a fan of headsets that flash silly blue light while it may not be very noticeable during the day it is very noticeable in the dark. 655+'s main button with the BB logo flashes blue light when it is on.  I prefer Nokia's approach with a very small and discrete light.I see the necessity to use the charging case as another downside of 655+.  Unless you have two charging cases or carry one with you all the time you cannot charge head set at home and in the car.Bottom line.  Given all the cons at five dollars it is a good value but I'd be disappointed if I paid more.
0	I bought this product knowing for the reviews that I had to be gentle with it the problem is that even though the red light lights up it never worked. So cheep. Not worth returning
2	Took almost 3 MONTHS to arrive... the order. Almost completely forgot about it.Arrived in transparent plastic bags not even a box.Build quality is shoddy. The ports don't align right and tolerance is loose. However they all seem to work so no problem there.If you can stand the wait sure order these. They work fine... when you get them.
2	This plug splitter worked fine for about one year. Last week I plugged in a air pump to the splitter as I had done many times before and it caused the splitter to start melting and smoking. Had to quickly pull it out of car almost too hot to handle.Made in China possibly!?
2	Pros:You turn 1 outlet into 3 and in theory you get a USB charging port as wellFits perfectly into the empty DIN slot below my stereoSuper cheapCons:Incredibly bright power LED really distracting while driving at nightAnytime you hit a bump at least one plug pops outUSB charging port doesn't work on minePlugs constantly pop outPower cord is incredibly thin something silly like 20 or 22 gauge - don't plug in anything that pulls a decent amount of power (i.e. no inverters).Did I mention the plugs constantly pop out?I deliver pizza on weekends and the pizza sign plugs in to my lighter.  I also keep my Zune and my phone charger plugged in.  The pizza sign probably draws 1-2 amps or so by itself with the Zune and phone pulling a little over an amp combined if the batteries are low.  This is still enough to make the cord on it a little warm - I'd be a bit more concerned if my lighter outlet had constant power but on my car it shuts off when you remove the key.Still $3 it'll serve its purpose until I can get something a bit higher quality.
0	I've been a Wilson fan since their days of manufacturing HF yagis and love my Wilson Sleek. I decided to upgrade to this gain antenna for increasing signal strength. However this antenna shows zero improvement over the little zero DB gain spike that  comes with the Sleek. My guess is the RG174 is higher loss than the thicker cable that comes with the spike antenna and counteracts any gain from this antenna.
0	The seller neglected to state that this antenna doesn't work alone.  I had no idea I needed to buy a separate receiver for it to work.  Should be sold together.
2	It works to an extent. There is a slight quality and reception improvement but no visible bar improvement. I do drop calls less often so that's good enough to keep it. The Sleek I bought it with is the same situation. I think I just have to admit I live in too much of a dead zone for anything to help.
2	I was thinking this would help pull in a better signal for my Sleek 4G... but I have found there is not much difference between it and the included short antenna.  I do like having the extra antennas though so I can keep them on different vehicles in the household instead of having to remove them when changing vehicles.
2	I used this with a Wilson booster. It worked great until the end of the cable fell apart. I am going to blame it on Wilson. The booster gets so flipping hot when I am using it that it actually burns my fingers. I think it got so hot that it finally melted the cable connector and fell apart. I called Wilson they said unless they put a heat sink on the booster the only way to get rid of the heat is through the cable connector.
2	I would not recommend this product since you cannot play music with it.  It is only useful for phone calls.
0	I purchased the blueant z9i headset based on the rave reviews submitted by other reviewers.  Unfortunately my personal experience with Blueant is nothing short of total disappointment.First off a little history.  Over the years I have used the old Logitech bulky but trusty Logitech Mobile Freedom.  Trust me besides the bulkiness and fit it has great battery life and very decent reception and sound quality.  It has better wind resistant than most.  My favorite is the Plantronics Voyager 510.  By far itis the best sounding and most trustworthy bluetooth headset.  I am still using it today.  I do not like the look and the fit but it works fine.  My only gripe is that it easily picked by ambient noise so wind noise and noisy environment kill the performance. In my quest of the ultimate bluetooth headset I purchased the Plantronic Voyager 815 and it was such a disappointment.I also used bluetooth headsets from various brands such as Nokia and Motorola.When I read the rave review of Blueant noise cancellation technology I jumped at the opportunity.  Boy am I disappointed when my receiving parties kept telling me there was a lot of noise (regardless of adjusting the position) in the background and my voice sounded tinny.  The volume from the headset is also on the low side.Since then I moved on to Jawbone II and then Jawbone prime.
2	The ONLY one reason for me not to keep this unit was the fact that wasn't working properly with my both mobile phones simultaneously.The noise cancellation factor was not a strong plus in this case.
0	I have had this product now for over 9 months. As a matter of fact i own 2. the sound and clarity are fine even when walking around in noisy areas. The problem i have had with both is the ear piece. For one of them the ear piece post has broken off and with the second one the rubber gel on the earpiece has started separating from the post. Blue Ant wants to charge $20 for two replacement ear gels. That is ludicrous i can by a new blue tooth for $60.UPDATE: So now that I've had to return my order. I realize that this was not the best choice. The Blue Ant sent was not in its retail package. Just the pieces in a padded envelope. That was fine initially since it was a refurb. Although someone pack the wrong charger in the package. The return dept. stated I should sent the pieces back with UPC code and retail packaging....HUh? I don't think these guys know what they are doing.I need to find a better product.
2	After using this headset for 2 months I decided to finally leave a thorough review.Pros:Noise cancellation works very well.  People can't even hear my noisy studded tires when I am driving.Headset is lightweight and feels great wearing it.  (I forget it's in my ear it's co comfortable.)Volume can go very loud.  It is much louder than most headsets.Cons:The metal/plastic earhook is very brittle and can break very easily.  Mine snapped in half in the first two weeks.No dedicated on/off switch so it turns on constantly if left in a pocket (and then starts calling people when you bump the button).Earpiece screws on and off but is very fragile.  Mine broke after 2 months of usage.Horrible customer service when dealing with BlueAnt for warranty repair.Conclusion:For something that costs this much I would expect it to be higher quality.  While I really liked the call quality it isn't worth having this headset if it won't last. If you are looking for decent noise cancellation I've found the Samsung WEP470 does just as good of a job has a dedicated on/off button and is less than half the price of this headset.  Unless BlueAnt gets a more durable headset and better customer service I don't think it's worth the premium pricing of their products.
2	this can only be used for phone calls.  Most people need to hear music also from their bluetooth device.  Not recommended.
2	I bought this as a replacement for a Motorola 850....it's an improvement but still doesn't meet my expectations.  Upon connecting there are occasionally echos but they go away soon expecially if you turn down the volume.  Range is very limited.  Drops connection at close range occasionally.  Cheap feel; buttons don't feel solid.  Light weight and comfortable.  Maybe there are just limitations with Bluetooth technology but I have yet to find a headset that provides a crystal clear connection that is reliable.  I'm spoiled after working in Japan where all of the cell technology provideds crystal clear communications.
2	I was all excited about receiving this great technology but upon receipt i discovered that this earpiece is not clear.  sounds muffled although i did experience some relief upon adjusting the headphone lower. expected more bang for my buck...
2	I loved this case for the 2 months that it lasted. After having it for about 60 days the rubber started to stretch all the way around and looked like crap. I scrapped it for a Belkin case and I like it WAY more.
2	I liked this case but it broke when I dropped it after 6 months cracking the frame at the top which makes the entire case not fit on the phone anymore.  I bought another in a different color and it did the same thing but this time broke while in my purse near the charging area of the case.  They need to make the frame material just a little more elastic so it doesn't shatter so easily.  If you tend to drop your phone this will save your phone for sure but the case will break.  Other otterbox cases are more elastic and thicker and will not break.I do have to say that although the case broke my phone did not. So it did the job but I needed a new case.
2	I have the original ST Lite and I just bought a ST3 for my wife. It does not sound as good as mine. I was expecting it to be better. It is still better than most others on the market.
2	This is a pretty straight forward piece of technology.Pros:Voice announced callseasy buttonspairs up quickly and easilySound qualityCons:Volume seems to be either too loud or two soft with the setting intervals available.Design is sleek but unimaginativeThe Speaker is not as clear as other reviews have said.In terms of price and features with voice announced calls and voice activated calls it lives up to what it says it can do but I still think there is definite room for improvements.I have an Iphone 3G.
2	I would agree with reviewers that rate this speaker phone 1 or 2 stars. You can buy a much cheaper speaker phone that works just as well which I would say is Mediocre. It works fine if there's no road noise but as soon as you hit the freeway your callers are all saying what what! and for some reason I also found the volume on my end going up and down to the point that I was saying what all the time too. I called my home phone several times and left test messages and what I herd when I got home and listened to the test was the audio had a distortion and a quivering quality to it like you would hear with a real cheep digital voice recorder. I also found the voice prompts got annoying after a while.
2	People said that my voice was really muffled and the speaker isnt that great either...stick to the earpiece for bluetooth
2	I've gone through 4 different Bluetooth headsets over the last 3 years with less than satisfactory results. Most of the time I either couldn't hear the other party or they couldn't hear me. On top of the lousy sound quality I also didn't like the idea of having a radioactive device setting right inside my ear even though it is supposed to emit less energy than holding your cellphone to your ear. So I was back to holding my phone when in the car. However with the recent implementation of the no cell phone when driving law in MD I knew I had to do something. Thankfully I stumbled upon this device when doing a google search. I am very pleased. The sound quality is good not like the tinny sound that most speakerphones make. The volume setting initially was almost too loud but I was able to quickly adjust that. I'm surprised that others are having trouble with the volume being too low but as someone pointed out the kind of car you drive may make the difference. I drive a Toyota Prius and it is much quieter than say a sports car like a Corvette (with its dual exhaust system).I was unable to download my phone book from my cell phone but think it may be because the model is a few years old. Not having voice-activated dialing wasn't all that important to me as most voice-command devices are pretty awful anyway. But I would like to get the incoming call announcements. Maybe when I upgrade my phone in a few months I'll be able to take advantage of this feature as well. But even without this feature this device is well worth the price.Update March 14 2010 -- Having had the device about 4 months ago my feelings have changed somewhat. After the initial good experience for the past 3 months I've had to endure comments from my friends that they can barely hear me or everything I say echoes on their end or I sound like I'm under water. Frankly I'm rather frustrated. I read in the manual that the echo comes from my having the volume set too high but when I adjust it on the device I can barely hear my friends. I'm still using the device but I am in the market looking for something better.
0	I got 4 of these on sale shortly after our state mandated no handheld phones in car.  I chose the brand based on a solid year's use of another Blueant bluetooth speaker I had bought for another person as a gift.Right away one of the speakers wasn't ever working properly.  Weeks later mine stopped working.  The other 2 probably aren't getting used as my wife doesn't use her phone a lot and my mom probably let the battery die.  I won't get feedback on those.They paired up right away and worked (mostly) off the line.  But since 2 of the 4 I bought have either failed to stay paired or when paired simply have no quality connection I can't recommend this product and I hesitate to recommend the brand.
2	I bought the BlueAnt ST3 after reading many good reviews.  I would give it a 4 rather than a 5.  It is decent quality but not something exceptional.  It's positives are that it holds charge for long it's ability to go to sleep and wakeup on the car door closure are great.  However it's sound quality is not as good and it does have challenges iin pairing and transferring the address book. I later bought a Jabra Cruiser-2 for my other car and found that to be far superior in voice quality but it did not have the feature of wake up on door closure.  Overall I still found that to be better than blueant-ST3.Apr 11:Adding to the original review.  After some use the voice quality of the Blueant ST3 has degraded.  The ring tones is jarring and the voice is low.  It is not as easy to understand on the other end too.
2	The voice quality is fine. There are two big flaws however:1. Lack of dedicated on/off button. You have to turn it off by holding the call button a full 3 seconds.2. Bluetooth range is TOO long.Ideally this device would only turn on when your in the car and turn off once you leave. If there was a dedicated on/off button it would not be too much of a hassle but asking someone to push one button 3 seconds every time is asking alot. If the bluetooth range was shorter that would be an alternative however it picks up my phone in the kitchen with the unit in a car in the far side of an adjacent two car garage.
2	Pros1)  Compact2)  Feature buttons (receive call end call) clear and easily pressed.Cons1)  Echo lends to poor sound reproduction2)  Tinny sound.
0	I just got this and really like it but will not load my Iphone phone book and support on blue ant sucks. They want me to send it in for testing instead of a new one. Don't buy it!
2	We have had this bluetooth for two days and so far can't complain all that much. Yhe only complaint I have is that it will turn off in the midfle of your conversation with a fully charged battery. But my friend guy loves it so I'm not going to complain cause I won't be using it...
0	You get what you pay for. I purchased this for a friend and now I lost that friend. They realized I'm the type of person who buys cheap crap hoping it will perform. The thing never held a charge. When connected to a plug sure it worked nicely enough. But what's the point of having a wired bluetooth??
2	Works but not perfectly.  Hard to carry because it is generally too big.  Needs to have a way to clip on to things better...plug in plastic things do not cut it....did not return but not crazy about it.
2	I bought the BoxWave stylus to use with my Cruz tablet which has a capacitive multi-touch screen and to cut down on the fingerprints that touch screen picks up after some use.  This stylus is supposed to work on all capacitive touch screens.  It basically works but sometimes I have to push down a bit more on the rubberized stylus point to get it to register on my screen.  I'm guessing that a little more weight to the stylus may improve operation of it.  My screen still seems to respond best to light finger touch.  Depending on your tablet product though you may have a better user experience with the stylus.
0	that us only for Android tablets. I wish I had noticed that before I got it  sent it back obviously.I would think they would want ti make it for all tablets with capacitive screens
0	I've had this stylus for a month and while it worked well at first it does not now. The tip is dirty looking and it takes more pressure to get it to respond it also leaves many more smears on the screen then my fingers do. I'm not sure how or if the tip can be cleaned. I would avoid this stylus unless you want one that is disposable.
2	I initially bought this to use on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 with the SketchBook mobile app. I wasn't pleased with the way it handled at all - I have better control with my fingers. After trying different ways to use it I found that wetting the tip a bit improves the control but not significantly enough for me to continue using it for Sketching. It works well for basic touching etc. It's hollow and very light. The metal clip is a nice feature to ensure it stays put. However I'll have to look into a better stylus for drawing - perhaps the elago.
2	the tip is waaaaay too big for what i was wanting.. not sure what this would be needed for i got for a phone maybe a tablet?
2	Gave it only three stars initially for very confusing instructions on how to pair this device with TL86109!  I was about ready to pack this up and return it thinking it was not compatible with TL86109.  The instructions in the guide for the TL7600 do not work for for the 86109.  You must go to Page 133 of the manual for the 86109 to pair it. Luckily I saved the manual for the phone which I bought 3 Years ago!(Very simple if you don't still have the manual---you just press down the HOLD button on the telephone base. It will then say REGISTERING HANDSET)After following the instructions it still wouldn't pair. It would say REGISTERING HEADSET for about 45 seconds then beep and return to homescreen.  I removed the battery and unplugged the charger then plugged everything back in placed headset in charger and tried it again. (NOTE--I think it has to be on the charger base to pair)  PRESTO!  Headset registered after 3 seconds.  I haven't used it much yet will update review after using for a bit.
0	First when the unit is operating normally its lowest volume setting is too loud by a factor of 2 which is only good if you're hard of hearing. If you're not this headset will probably damage your hearing until you no longer notice.Secondly the unit spontaneously stops working. It becomes necessary to disconnect the battery not just once but twice. I tried replacing the battery so that's not the problem. The result of accessing the battery so many times is that the cheap plastic cover will eventually loosen up and refuse to stay attached to the unit.
2	1.  I'm on my third pair of these headphones;  thankfully i only purchased them once but Sennheiser has been a solid company and as sent me two brand new units.2.  Bottomline these headphones are great sounding wireless / bluetooth headphones they fit well (at least my head) and are easy to operate.  However as with all wireless headphones they are overtly inferior to the traditional wired headphones in terms of sound quality and volume (huge issue with me).  Furthermore compared to the BT wireless line in Sennheiser this unit is overtly inferior in terms of sound and especially build quality.  So getting to my main point (sorry for taking so long) all in all a nice pair of wireless phones (ie you should have a specific purpose for a wireless set over a traditional wired set).  The problem with this specific line is that they're poorly made.  The on / off button is... lame.  Specifically it's difficult to tell if you're pressing down on the button properly.  Ok so what one may say and I agree.  Clarifying statement in terms of the poorly made:  I have send back two units because one unit would not turn off (I tried every trick in the book but the button was stuck or something else was going on)  The other unit wouldn't turn on consistently.  There would be days where it would work properly and then other days when the darn thing wouldn't powerup (yes the headphones were fully fully charged).3.  Thus unless you specifically require this type / shape of headphones (which I do) then I would strongly recommend going with the higher priced but definitely much better Sennheiser wireless phones (ex: the BT line which are truely 5 star products).4.  On a side note: Kudos to Sennheiser for being a 5 star company;  no questions asked no hassles they're a company that stands behind their products and puts out excellent stuff... most of the time.
0	This second unit has a crooked band around the neck and it does not fit the ear well.  I did not use it and it is too late to return a defective product that came to me like that.
2	Bought this item as part of a package and I must say it's a bit weird and takes a long time to charge batteries. Wouldn't recommend buying it. Invest in other type of chargers here.
2	These mini battery chargers do work but they are extremely slow. Most modern smartphone external battery chargers use 800 to 1000mA of electricity. These mini chargers only use 200mA. Simple math tells you that they will need 4 or 5 times as much time to charge your battery. If you have all night maybe that isn't a big deal. Don't use this if you're in a hurry.
2	this  is product is a little weak but if you handle it carefully all goes well. thanks for  the product
0	I only rated this charger two stars because it takes so long for this second battery to charge. I have two external chargers that I plugged my spare batteries into and my captivate battery charged much faster then my infuse battery (they both were completely new & needing a full charge). So it works however its taking 7hrs or more to fully charge my spare batteries. Ok its been only 4 days now and this charger does not work. It blinks like its charging but when the extra battery is place in the phone it has not charged at all. This is disappointing dropping to 1 star no star if it was possible!
2	it takes patience to get your battry lines up just right on the charger. it also takes a long time to get a full charge on the battery. maybe 4-5 hours.
2	Have had just about every high end bluetooth ear piece out there including this one. It was just Ok. I did return it do to the fact that it didn't pair up well with the LG Dare and the voice commands were not that good. The best bluetooth ear pieces out there are the Plantronics  Voyager 510 and the Plantronics Voyager Pro. Have had three 510 over the past three years with my family and just bought the Voyager Pro. Will continue buying there products. I use a bluetooth at least 8 to 10 hours every day and want them to do the job that they were intended for---make and receive calls with voice commands and have the audio on both ends of the conversation good.
0	I am iPhone 3G user. I love the iPhone. I had a cheap Motorola H375 BT earpiece that worked just fine except it wasn't very comfortable in my ear and fell out easily. It sounded good though.I used to own a Blue Ant Speakerphone. It was great! It had a great battery life and worked perfectly right up to the day it buzzed and just died. I got a lot of usage from it and I was left with a favorable opinion of the company even though it just went kaboom one day.I am a self professed gadget freak. Ok there I said it.When I saw the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset and read about it's features I just knew it was for me. Initially it was to expensive but when I saw it on Amazon for $79 I figured I couldn't go wrong.ROFL!Okay I always try and give new gadgets a fair trial before recommending it to my friends or clients or giving up on it. I have now been using the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset exclusively since December 2009.It is simply the most frustrating Bluetooth earpiece I have ever used! After 3 weeks I turned off the voice prompts & speech recognition. It announces the CallerID for incoming calls but it's seems to take forever to finish what it wants to say BEFORE you can answer the phone.If the earbud isn't perfectly aligned with you ear you will just tick off people if you call or answer them as they can't hear anything you are saying. This is especially prevalent in the car. (2003 Ford Expedition EB a somewhat quite car)It really has trouble coordinating things with the iPhone 3G. Calling out no problem It uses the earpiece just fine. Go to answer a call... Not so much it selects the iPhone and you manually have to select the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset on the iPhone menu. Okay before I get a bunch of replies YES I DID TRY THIS AND THAT. It just didn't work properly consistent if at all on the inbound calls.Okay with all of this I still continued to try the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset but I have now given up on it.Perhaps I will just put it on my bookshelf and marvel at the technology that allows all this functionality in such a small form factor. I guess I'd be more amazed if it actually worked.Pros:Comfortable and stays put on my ear.Volume level is decentGooG-411 built in and is hard coded into the speech recognitionCons:It sucks.Poor audio fidelityNot iPhone friendlyIt sucks.Battery life not to good.Really Bright blinking while on. (This can be deactivated but likes to come back on)It sucks.In case I wasn't clear I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.I hope you find this review useful as I too read these reviews myself when I am about to purchase products like the new Bluetooth headset I am going to buy now. Let the research begin!~e
2	I purchased this Bluetooth in May of 2009 and had lost it by October.  That certainly isn't the product's fault but when I went to order a new one I went with the Z9i instead.  The voice command to the headset is a nice gimmick and I would use it every one in a while but I spent more time getting through the V1 to get to the phone than in savings or convenience of being able to command the V1.I have just received th Z9i and it seems to work at least as well as the V1 and I can get to the phone voice commands to make a call or check the time a lot quicker.
2	The idea of this Bluetooth headset is a good one however I had some problems with the voice commands capability. On more than one occasion in a months time it stopped recognizing any voice commends (like 'dial voicemail' 'call back' etc). I had to power it off and back on a couple of times to get it to work again.I also thought the caller id announce would be nice but in practice it only works if you wear the headset all the time. If you are not wearing it and miss the caller id announce but put it in your ear as the phone is ringing and press the button to answer the call it only works about half of the time. I actually missed several calls and had to call people back due to this. Also I find that I like to just put the headset on when I need to make or receive a call and then take it off. For this I feel that the Plantronics 925 is a better choice since it's a bit easier to put in my ear and take off and it comes with a nice charging case for storage. With the BlueAnt I always had trouble figuring out where to put it when not in use.Also on the BlueAnt callers said I sounded more muffled than on the Plantronics although they could hear less background noise. In practice noise cancellation isn't really a big deal because I find that I would rather make a call in a semi-quiet environment anyway. If I'm in my car I just roll the windows up no big deal.I ended up returning this headset mainly due to the reliability issue. The fact that my voice didn't sound as good as other Bluetooth headsets was also a deal breaker for me. I'd rather sound better and not have as good noise cancellation than have good noise cancellation but sound crappy.
2	This cover is just like a red one that I had.  The rubberized finish rubbed off of that one exposing bare metal.  I haven't used this one yet because I feel pretty sure the same thing will happen.  I can't really give a fair review of this product yet.
2	I bought this product because I was getting a new phone and tend to drop my phones a lot.  I wanted the most protective cover I could buy.  After doing lots of on-line research I purchased the body glove product.It provided awesome protection and was very easy to take on and off the phone but it made my phone bulky and uncomfortable to talk on.  I almost returned the phone and then found the problem solved when I took off the cover.  I have fairly small hands so that could be part of the problem.
2	Hard to use and set up. Won't stay on the ear. And hurt my ear to wear it.Other than that. It was load enough to hear the other person. And had a noise canceling button. Just didn't work well for me.  Maybe for others it would work better. Gave it away.
2	I just wasn't happy with the fit for my ear. The connection with my phone wasn't as clear as one of my previous motorola's. Gave it away to someone that seemed to like it fine.
0	I've had the unit for three days. The product suffers from these glaring problems:1. It is painful to wear. The earpiece cover is made of HARD rubber. Not foam. Not soft rubber. I am using the smallest of the three covers and my ear is bruised. I could wear the Plantronics Bluetooth for hours; this one is agony after a few minutes.2. The on/off button is located underneath the flexible skin of the unit. It is on a hair-trigger. I have disconnected numerous calls trying to adjust the Jawbone's position or the volume because touching the outer skin of the unit in any way hangs up the call.3. Sound quality is HORRIBLE. To be fair the marketing hook for this unit is the microphone technology. They should have saved some research money for the speaker. The sound is tinny and garbled.Keep looking: this unit is not the answer.
0	The Jawbone may perform admirably as far as technology.  I generally don't care about that so much not having a sports car and trying to avoid loud environments when I'm on a conference call.My issues are that the unit simply doesn't work well.  I've tried all the different tips including the available free additional tips and none of them stay in my ear.  You can jam the thing in there but it slowly works its way out over the course of a couple of minutes.  And since the only button is the external body of the unit if you try to press it back in you end up hanging up the call.  Great idea not to have a button or anything.  Similarly if you try and turn the thing off or on you hold down the button and you'll find your thumb covers up the little red/green light that tells you whether its on or not.  Stupid.
2	As the title in my review states I have owned many bluetooth headsets including the Jawbone 1 and 2. I recently got a Plantronics Discovery 925 and people that I have talked to says that this is the best sounding headset I have used.
0	Don't Buy it!! The ear hooks seemed to break after a month of wearing... but wait it came w/ 3 or 4 additional....but wait there are more to buy but wait why would you want to but more when the thing would shut off w/out waring or be unable to saty connected to your phone!!!! Wow god thing amazon had it for a reasonable price and that I did not get hosed on the price at the retail store!!! buy the  Plantronics M50 - Bluetooth Headset!! look for it amazon has it!!!!L.S.ThomasWest chesterPa.
2	I've had this headset for less than a year and it's already busted. The ear loop snapped off while it was in the pocket of my suit. On top of that the battery life on the headset has greatly diminished in it's capacity. I can only hold a 1 hour conversation before I need to charge it again. It seems like the headset is in the charger more than it is in my ear.Performance wide it does not seem to perform as advertised. It does not do a very good job at removing the background noise.Friends that have this headset also have complained about its feel and performance. I would not recommend this headset to anyone.
2	Overall it has pretty good sound quality. The listeners DON'T tell me I sound like I'm speaking from the bottom of a well which is good news.PROS:It has a pretty good range actually. I talk going up and down stairs in my house while the phone is somewhere.Easy to turn on and off.Good sound quality.Answer and hang up with a button.Use voice control on the iPhone.CONS:The order of turning on your Bluetooth device (i.e cell phone) and your Jawbone matter to connect which is really annoying.The earpiece is not universal in fact it's too big for most people.It has this clamp which is suppose to go around the ear but it's very difficult to put on and if you give it too much force it will break! (happened to me)It's cheap material.
2	I am disappointed with this unit. First of all the buttons are placed in such a way that you are constantly hanging up on people when you are adjusting the headset in your ear.Audio is terrible in regular mode (hearing other people). It works great in Noise Assassin mode but that mode drains battery power quickly and has to be turned on every time you use it.Then there is the problem with getting the unit close to your cheek so that the noise cancellation can work correctly. It is a real pain. If your beard is slightly growing in forget it. It will not work.The size of the unit was good. The fit in my ear was not that great and hurt my ear after a while. They should have included Jabra ear gels.While this unit has good technology behind it the design needs work.
0	Aliph Jawbone II is a farce. I tested it by calling several people and nobody can hear me well. They all said I sounded very far away even though the volume was at it's maximum. The fit is not comfortable at all. I tried every single earbud and earloop. If the VAS button can't make contact with your face the unit is useless. As you have to press it against your face (face too skinny?) what is the point of wearing a headset if you need to use one hand to operate it and the other hand on the steering wheel? This is not safe IMHO.
0	I really wanted to like this headset. Before I purchased it I thought it was small unobtrusive no blinky-blinky lights very subtle and professional. And all of the blogs yammering about military-grade Noise Assasin technology made me think I couldn't go wrong.Wrong.After purchasing it I couldn't get it to stay in my ear and I tried many (I got bored after about a dozen) iterations of over ear and in-ear adjustments. But I was willing  to tolerate it falling out of my ear all the time if it just served its primary function.But it didn't.People kept saying they couldn't hear me or the background noise was intolerable (so much for noise assassin). Also whenever I tried pressing the Jawbone further into my ear so I could hear better I pushed the disconnect button and ended my call.Ooops.And I paid the early adopter price at the AT&T; store; nearly $150 with shipping.My bad.Don't repeat my error. This is not a good product.
0	i bought the aliph jawbone II bluetooth headset with noiseasssassin in black and i hated it it did not work like it suppose to.
2	Just like the original Jawbone this device is easy to use charges quickly but the buttons are easier to push than the original Jawbone.  The only problem is this BT does not fit in my ear comfortably and therefore is worthless to me.If you are looking for a great BT device this maybe the one you are looking for if it fits in your ear.  Make sure you purchase the device at a place that has a good return policy.  I would hate to spend this much money for a paper weight.I had to give this BT a three star but if I had a friend asking me if he should try it I would say yes in a heart beat.If there are ever more options in fitting this device I will try it again.
2	First off a little history. Over the years I have used the old Logitech bulky but trusty Logitech Mobile Freedom. Trust me besides the bulkiness and fit it has great battery life and very decent reception and sound quality. It has better wind resistant than most. My favorite is the Plantronics Voyager 510. By far itis the best sounding and most trustworthy bluetooth headset. I am still using it today. I do not like the look and the fit but it works fine. My only gripe is that it easily picked by ambient noise so wind noise and noisy environment kill the performance. In my quest of the ultimate bluetooth headset I purchased the Plantronic Voyager 815 and it was such a disappointment.I also used bluetooth headsets from various brands such as Nokia and Motorola.When I saw the Aliph Jawbone II on sale I jumped on the opportunity to check it out.  So far the pluses:1. noise cancellation does work well - caller from the receiving end commented that I was in the office but in reality I was driving in my car2. wind noise resistant - pretty good just make my voice a bit muffledThe minuses:1. The fit is not so good and even with the ear loop voice quality depended heavily on how and where you position the jawbone II2. Battery life (active not standby) seemed shorter than stated (4 hrs) - your mileage may vary but I got about 2 hours talk time out of it3. The talk button is very sensitive and I cut off my caller a few times while adjusting the headset4. Volume button has to be cycled to adjust volume rather than a rocker than allows you to go 1 step louder or softer at a time.5. Bulk packaging definitely missed the other ear loops and ear gels6. Unable to pair the headset simultaneously with 2 cell phones
0	The Jawbone II bluetooth headset is not really made very well and is a lot worse than people seem to give it credit for. Parts fall off after a short time and it is very cheaply made.Further once you set it up you can only use it on one ear. Other headsets (like Plantronics ones for example) allow you to swivel the earloop to switch ears if you get tired of using it on one ear. The Jawbone doesn't do this. In order to switch ears you have to remove the earloop and reinstall it.While the Jawbone's noise cancellation does seem good that's about all it has going for it because your voice still sounds muffled soft and digital-like.But my main complaint is with the Aliph Jawbone company customer service itself-they are absolutely horrible. They advertise on their website that the Jawbone has a 1 year manufacture warranty to the end consumer. But my Jawbone broke and when I contacted them about getting warranty service on it they rudely informed me that they only provide warranties on units bought directly from their own website. If I bought from some other retailer it has ZERO warranty! I'm not sure whether or not this is even legal but do believe it reflects very poorly on the company that they don't even stand behind their own products.I would never recommend buying this headset or any other made by Aliph.A much better choice would be theBlueAnt  Z9i Bluetooth Headset (Black)because:-It doesn't require the unit to be touching your jaw bone or cheek at all-It's a lot easier to put on and take off-It's more comfortable and doesn't fall off as easily-It' has two selectable levels of noise cancellation-It's firmware update-able-It has wind noise suppression-It's cheaper yet audio quality both to callers and to you are about the same. Noise cancellation is about equal-It has a full 2 year warranty
2	This paired ok but both talk modes people had trouble hearing me and the quality of the conversation was very poor. this is not a good head set!
0	I purchased this product because I work in a noisy environment and thought this would do the trick.  It worked fine as far as noise reduction but fails in the design.I had problems getting used to the fact that I didn't need to raise my voice to be heard on the phone.  I'm having to shout at someone 5 feet away and then speak normally when on the phone.  Hard to get used to but I was working on it!This device though is extremely painful to wear for any length of time.  The part behind the earpiece that rides on the cartilage of my ear has some very nice sharp pointy corners that get painful after a couple of minutes.  I tried all combinations of earpiece & hangar without success.  I would have tried the Jabra ear gels that others have recommended except for one other issue.I use a headset as an occasional device but this seems to be designed to be worn at all times.  I want a device that will turn on when I want it on not on its own.  The power button is extremely easy to depress and turn on.  I carry this in a pouch on my belt and the pressure of the pouch was turning it on when it was in it.  I try to answer an incoming call and find it has gone to the device instead of the phone.In summary if it fits good and you're going to wear it all the time this is a great device especially in a noisy environment.
0	I own 2 of the first generation - they are just wonderful. This new JB is very comfortable. The clarity is lacking and the noise reduction does not seen as good. Callers at the other end are always complaining of the poor quality. I have had to do a total reset several times due to a total deterioration in sound.
2	I was excited about receiving this phone cover.  I am fond of red my phone is black problem solved (I thought).  I was happy to find this product.  I was particularly happy about the fact that it was rubberized.I was really careful with my phone because I was so happy with the cover (at first).  Normal activity of sliding the phone in and out of my belt case (for work) rubbed the red coating off leaving bare metal exposed.  Needless to say it looked really bad.  Rubberization---Great concept.  It just needs improved durability.
2	Its a good case I give it a three only thing is the paint scratchs off real easy but still good for the phone
2	This case is well made and feels good at first but then it stretched out badly and I don't use it anymore.
2	I purchased this case in the magenta when I bought my iphone 3g...it was ok but I ended up taking back the iphone because I was having problems with it and returned the case at the same time. I went back to purchase the iphone 3g again now that most of the problems are worked out and all of the guys in the AT&T store had the Incipio Silicrylic cases on there iphones. It is similar to this but has a harder plastic that goes on the outside of the silicone cover. It is much better. I purchased it in Magenta as well. I love it and can't say enough good things about it. The dermaSHOT was ok but the silicrylic protects your phone better without any extra bulk.
2	It does what you want it too.  It's not as refined a finished product for the $15 price.  You can feel the mold seems.  It fits properly and came with a screen protector.
2	After 9 months of using the JawboneII I have to give it a middling score overall. The earbuds that came with it were completely worthless and I have now broken the last earloop. So I'm back to using my Motorola H710. I had forgotten what a good fit it was! No more worrying that when I take it off or put it on I'll bend the earloop too far and break it. The only thing the Jawbone has in it's favor is the noise-cancelling. Besides inadvertantly ending calls when the thing threatens to drop off my ear I would also get a strange noise sometimes when attempting to answer a call (kind of like the noise you hear when tightening guitar strings).Too bad they did such a terrible job in the fitting department. I even purcased the eargels on Amazon after breaking the first loop or two trying to get it to fit better.
2	not great.  not bad.  i have a beard and it doesn't touch my cheek so the mic doesn't work well with me also it doesn't fit my ear that well. basically i have to readjust ever 30 seconds or so.  wouldn't recommend but cheap enough.
2	I waited for this product (GOLD version) and bought it online as soon as it was available. Not smart. The fit is horrible: it falls out constantly! In addition there is no case so it will turn on when it is touched by other items in my purse. Alsothe battery life is NANO seconds. This was a bad purchase decision and it cost too much $$$ whhich makes o sense given the poor fit. I bought it for the color and style instead of the quality. My dad was right: the best lessons are the ones we pay for....
2	The holder itself is fine but beware that the text and pictures used with the product are not accurate.  The text describes and the pictures show items not actually included in the package.  Specifically the AMPS mounting plate -square plastic piece with four holes in the corners- is NOT in the box.  That part is specifically why I wanted this holder and now I will have to order it separately even though is is supposed to be included.The holder itself seems fine.  I've used Bracketron before and this is more or less a typical Bracketron holder.Unfortunately I need that AMPS plate.  If your car is outfitted for AMPS like mine just be prepared to spend more money and time acquiring that one little part that should be included per the item description.
2	Generally I like this bracket although not as much as some others.  My biggest annoyance is that you have to pump the release button like 1 million times to get the brackets to expand.  Fix that please
0	Horrible device - I had purchased 3 of these from various sources - one from Amazon - guess what  2 of the three have broken - one at the joint behind the holder - and one of the devices jaws came open while driving dropping my expensive device.Just a poor buying and using experience.
2	The little lever to push in which adjusts the width only does its job about 1/3 of the time. The other times I just push it in vain.
0	I'm only being honest people... complete utter junk! With all the other things out there I should have never purchased this. I was in a rush so I jumped to a bad item. All phone are different so I will give you this tip: get something that you can mount to your dashboard with double side white foam tape. However don't install it in the middle of the dash. If possible fix it to the drivers left side corner of the dash. Now it is out of the line of sight for distractions.As for this thing... it shakes it rattles it makes all kinds of noise and the weight of a smart phone was just to much for it.
2	ok product good buy for the price but the tension springs that hold it to the vent keep popping out if it is moved at all
0	i thought for $8 these were a good deal but they are uber-cheap!  the spring-loaded vent clips only attach on the top of the unit and the thicker vents on my jeep cause them to pop off occasionally.  also the bottom of the mount doesn't attach at all so every time you hit a bump in the car the phone and mount flop around...poor design if you need a vent mount look elsewhere!
0	The design is okay but the whole thing is made from really cheap plastic.The ball joint mechanism is really hard to move and adjust.The ball joint has a plastic cylindrical protusion that attaches to the holder.  That part broke it is weak and thin.  If they were gonna make the most important joint thin then they should've made it out of metal not cheap plastic.
2	One of the best air vent holder that I bought--and I have tried a lot--  just needs some more stability to have a five star.
0	I guess its a crap shoot when you buy cheap but since a Lot of the reviews were positive I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately the&#34;Spring loaded locking mechanism&#34;  did not work on this one making it effectively useless
2	Unless you hit the sweet spot in installation the holder fits awkwardly and doesn't feel sturdy. I would recommend going with an air vent mount or a CD slot mount.
2	I bought this in a never-ending battle to find a way to mount my iPhone on the dash of my car mostly for using GPS. I'm always looking... I've since found a better hanging solution but I used this holder for a time with mixed results.The phone fits in the brackets just fine. That's not a problem. And it does grip the vents tightly. I just couldn't get the thing to sit at a usable angle. And truth be told I've never liked the vent idea. It basically means you can't use that vent all winter -- heat blasting at my iPhone isn't something I recommend -- and for those of us that live up north sometimes it's just too cold to give up your closest source of heat.
2	I purchased this case as a replacement for the case my dog chewed up.  While I have no doubt that this is an OEM product (my wife recently purchased a BlackBerry Curve that shipped with the exact same case) I have to say that it is of a lower quality than the case that came with the BlackBerry I purchased more than a year ago.  The vinyl is thinner it puckers along the seams (especially on the bottom) and instead of having a nice rubbery coating the edges are rough.  This case will do the job (and the price was right) but I won't miss it when I finally replace my phone.
2	well the golden rule always works - you get what you paid for. Wouldn't retract after 3-4 times. too think to fit your iPhone if it have protective case. Otherwise works great  :) Will make great garage sell item
2	its a good cord that does what you need it to do but you can tell it's cheaply made and the sticker on the side of it isn't even in the exact center it's awkward looking.
2	Product does what it is suppose to but I was buying also because the picture showed a smaller connector that goes into the iPhone.  This way I could keep on my iPhone case. With this product  have to remove the case to use the cable because the connector is much wider than the normal Apple connector
2	I have bought a few of these in the past. They work ok for the most part. After a lot of usage the cable can become weak and eventually break. But you can't beat the ease of use of the retractable cord. I throw one or two in bag for use on the road. Can't beat the price. Also keep searching for the one that offers free delivery. With free delivery the price is nothing and you can afford to get a few.
2	I'm glad I bought this as I could keep my iPod plugged in and leave it in my compartment in my car without having a cord sticking out everywhere but the connection was shot after a few months (of daily use). Worth the money 3 stars.
2	...as I recall.  It was a bit slippery.  But functioned well and saved my phone from damage on a few drops.
0	I purchased this case from BBuy and I have had it for almost a year.  The cheap thin leather has peeled all the way off and now I just have a sharp and jagged plastic case.  I do not recommend this case as it will also start to loosen over time.  I use the DLO case as it's reliable.I also have a high quality screen protector which IMHO is the most important protection you can put on an iphone.  Whatever case you end up getting get a high quality screen protector...As far as this case goes I'm looking to replace it with something very lean so I can still put the phone in the DLO...as you can see I like a few layers of protection for my beloved iphone!
2	I purchased this on the clearance aisle so I didn't expect the thing to last forever. The texturing on the back is nice and the fit is snug however I had a couple of annoying problems with it.1. The fit is a little *too* snug on the top piece and the bottom piece never quite slid on completely leaving a gap of about 2 millimeters between the top and bottom which got caught on my jeans going in and out of my pocket.2. The thin piece of plastic on the bottom piece that goes over the front is flimsy and eventually developed a crack (then an outright break) from just taking the phone in and out of my pocket. I never dropped it once and the bottom half broke within a few months.3. As others have noted the texturing on the back comes loose in time and it developed little bubbles on the back after a few weeks where the adhesive had given way.I paid less than $20 for the case and for that price I can't complain much. However it would have been nice if it had lasted longer than a few months.
2	The rubberized leather started to peel off the corner and any dirt that gets inside scratches the back.  I've started to let my iPhone go naked instead of subjecting it to this fat torture chamber.
2	The case itself is fantastic as many reviewers have said.  Fantastic grip button access is excellent and I'm way more confident taking the phone to the store and the gym with this case on.  I really needed a case+belt clip solution though and this doesn't seem to cut it.  The belt clip is really flimsy.  It is quite difficult to put on and off the belt and I'm pretty sure the clip will break very soon.  The holster itself is also flimsy and if you wear it with your shirt on the outside (not tucked into pants) there is a big piece of plastic that digs into your skin from the back of the clip.  I may keep this for now just for the case but will have to keep looking for a viable case+clip solution.
2	Loved this new iPhone skin. It felt so nice and slips on and off easily. BUT the iPhone button is not easy to press and I have now moved to other skins where even though they cover the iPhone button an easy press can activate it so it's my second choice for skin and I switch into it sometimes when I feel sportish :)!
2	I like the case but it has a funny smell that gives me a headache.  I had to send it back.
2	The item is way too large for the Verizon iphone 4.  It does not fit snug enough and you could almost fit another phone in this case.  The front part of the case open up because its too big causing dirt and other materials to get into the case.
0	I used this on a long 20+ hour flight (multiple connecting flights) and it recharged my phone fine on the first flight. But then it could only recharge it partially on my second (connecting) flight. I recharged it overnight in the hotel at my first destination before going on a long bus ride and it wouldn't fully charge my phone while enroute to my second destination. That's been my experience with this thing since then.The 5200 mAh is very overrated. Maybe like 3000 mAh when new and much less after it's been used a couple of times.This is my experience from 2011. It's been stored in a drawer for over year and I found it while cleaning up and finally decided to review it.Junk stay away.
0	Mine looked as good as new and seemed to be complete but the seals on the package had been broken when I received it.  It was pretty obviously something that had been returned but that's not a big deal to me (if it had been underwear or something I might have been concerned).  Anyway it arrived nearly fully charged (four out of five lights) when I plugged it into a USB port on my laptop.  So I plugged the output from the Satechi into my Nook Color and lo and behold the Nook proprietary cable lit up and it started charging away.  I turned on a video and let it play while the Satechi charged it and the Nook charge was increasing consistently the whole time.Then I disconnect the Satechi from my laptop so that it was no longer being powered.  Oops.  In less than five seconds the Nook cable's charging light turned off.  I pressed the status button on the Satechi (which is supposed to briefly light the indicators so you can see how much juice you have left) and nothing...no lights at all.  The Nook started discharging normally.I plugged the Satechi back into my laptop and all the status lights lit back up as well as the Nook cable's charging light.  Bottom line: the Satechi was obviously charged but wouldn't send a charge to the Nook unless the Satechi itself was being powered.  Kind of defeats the purpose.  If I hadn't gotten what appeared to be used goods I would have returned it for another - it sounds like a great thing - but decided against bothering with that and just returned it.
0	*** IMPORTANT: This battery only properly charges from a laptop USB port.  DO NOT attempt to use with a car charger wall charger etc. unless you confirm that it puts out ONLY 500 mA and no more.  See [UPDATE] section below for more details. ***[Capacity summary: was able to (carefully!) charge my Droid X **which has an extended internal battery with 20% more capacity** 1.3 times.  If product worked as advertised I should have been able to charge at least 2.3 times assuming my Li-ion phone battery is at the poor end of the charging-efficiency spectrum.  Would expect at least 2.7 charges for Droid X with regular (non-extended) internal battery.]Overall design is very nice; it looks very nice shape is good very attractive.  But... several problems.First this battery was supposed to be in 'new' condition but was very clearly (and heavily) pre-used; the box had stains sticky stuff and extra circular stickers on it (from where the previous 'owner' broke the seal).Second it didn't work.  My phone (Droid X with genuine Motorola extended battery BH6X which holds 1800 mAh instead of the usual 1500) could only charge from it a total of about 1.3 times before the external battery was totally drained.  I was surprised so I repeated the test and got the same results.  I was super careful: I let the external battery charge for 36 hours; I waited til my phone was down to 30%; then I charged it up to 100% (cell was on; gps/wireless off; all tasks killed; screen off/no activity).  I then disconnected the external battery right away when the phone reached 100%.I then repeated the process; I plugged the phone into the external battery at 30%.  About two hours later it was at 70% but the external battery was 100% drained.Very disappointing performance.  It was only able to transfer 45% of its alleged  energy to the Droid X (1800 x 1.3 = 2340 mAh out of 5200) but Wikipedia says that Li ion should be able to charge at 80-90% efficiency -- so something is clearly wrong here.I would stay away; I was worried when I bought it noticing that many recent reviews (as of April 2011) had complained of the same.  I think they're selling a bunch of their returned units.  This really irks me as I'm extremely busy and really don't have time for this kind of stuff; I want to just buy a product that works and lasts and I'm happy to pay whatever it takes.[UPDATE]Satechi contacted me.  They claim that smart phone chargers provide too many amps and that this fries the external battery.  They recommend *only* charging from a laptop (where the USB is limited to 0.5A) whereas I used (in my two tests) chargers with 850 and 1000 amps.However this is no excuse; this is a design defect.  You should be able to charge from any source as long as it has at least 500 mA.  Every other electronics device on the planet has circuitry to limit the amperage it takes in to what it needs and gracefully rejects excess current.  They tried very hard over the phone to convince me that this was not a design defect; I found this very disingenuous.  Review remains at 1 star... sorry Satechi.[/END UPDATE]
0	Connects quick to my phone but calls are dropped. Makes a weird high pitch squeel while it charges. The charger is not mini usb which means you have to use the proprietary one (negative imo). I got it for $-3 after a rebate. I'm happy getting paid $3 to buy this headset. Good shipping.Update: I didn't get the rebate so $23 for a pretty bad bluetooth. It is the only one I have that works currently. Callers complain about lots of noise on my end. The controls are pretty bad and I cannot use for voice commands with HTC Incredible.
2	I also have the Samsung WEP 200 which works well the microphone doesn't pick up too much noise and the speaker gets plenty loud.  The WEP 301 can't be used in some cars at highway speeds because it picks up too much noise.  It is almost as if there is no frequency filter.There are good things about it.  The wire for your ear can be adjusted to fit.  The headset comes with several different ear attachments.  There are some fun skins you can add to it.I got this headset assuming it would be at least as good as the WEP 200.  It isn't.
2	I got this for my wife so she'd have something to use in her car to make driving while talking a little easier. After trying it for a couple of days we returned it because we were unhappy with the sound quality on the OTHER end.THE GOOD:1. It's very small and light and very comfortable. It fit both of us very nicely and we both have freakishly small ears.2. Pairing with the phone (iPhone) was easy but I'm beginning to think that pairing is very seldom an issue with bluetooth headsets.3. The sound quality (speaker on the headset) was good.THE BAD:1. The only really bad thing and ultimately the reason we returned it is that the person on the other end had difficulty understanding what you were saying. My wife (the one using the Samsung WEP 301) always sounded very distant tinny and staticy. I thought it may be because I was listening to her on my bluetooth device (plantronics discovery 925) but other people had the same complaint. I frequently was having to ask her to repeat herself. WE got tired of this so we returned it and bought a Jabra 4010.As far as comparison to a similarly priced headset the Jabra 4010 is much better in my opinion. While it doesn't fit as deeply in the ear as the Samsung the sound quality on both ends is great. When my wife is using it I can't tell a difference between her using the headset and her using the phone.If you had to choose between the two devices I'd go with the Jabra 4010 easily...even if it is more expensive (which we paid the same price for both of them).
0	This is junk. I have never had one sound so bad. It doesn't even hold a charge for very long
2	The delivery was great earlier than expected. The shield looked as if it was rejected by Zagg for imperfections. It had lines and stamp marks that are visible when my iPhone is off and of course are invisible when on. Still cheaper than Zagg charges with no shipping costs.
0	When I ordered this Zagg Screen GuardI figured it was really good becuase there'svideos and people bragging about it.Well I was really dissapointed. Why?Because it's nothing but a piece of rubber.It doesn't look normal on the phone. My fingers didn'tglide accross the screen. And it left to much of aresidue and it was all streaked.Look just stick with the regular hard screen protectors.There way more dependable and less expensive and comes with more than 1.
0	Instead of giving you guys a long review of this product I am going to give you a summary of this product. BTW I am not a rookie in term of installing screen protectors I used to work in a cell phone company and have installed countless screen protectors for customers.Pro:NONECon:Will distorte your screen image very unclear (made of cheap vinyl) super Sticky It's almost impossible to remove it without pulling your screen off your phone literelly. Leaves residues on your phone after you remove it and it's a nightmare to remove the residues on your screen even with the trick of using a piece of tape to remove the residues. I had to exchange my phone because after removing this screen protector my touch sensore started acting up on me. I am asking for a refund and maybe even damage to my phone.If you care about your expensive phone please please DO NOT BUY this product it will give you more nightmares than you can handle!
0	iBought Invisible shield for the back of my iPhone 3G.  I studied all of the installation videos and instructions. Invisible Shield is impossible to apply properly. It sticks to itself when peeling it off the backing. The edges do not apply properly around the corners of iPhone 3G. The part of the film that does apply to the back of iPhone looks nasty.  At least Zagg accepted my return and credited the charge on the money-back guarantee.
0	I bought this product because it seemed like an excellent alternative to a case.  The product was difficult to install and did not cover the corners of my phone.  I ended up throwing it out do not waste your money because it is more difficult than it is worth you will be frustrated and your phone will have bubbles all over it.
2	The case looks good but it functionally left a lot to be desired.  I found that it rode high on my waist and dug into me when I sat down.  When I accidentally turned the case on its side (I bought the clip and attachment that allows the case to rotate) my iPhone 4 fell out and hit my asphalt driveway.  Luckily there was no damage.  There is nothing on top of the case to hold the phone in.  Once I put a case back on the iPhone the phone fit snugly in the holster but I still didn't feel comfortable knowing that there was no clip or flap on top of the holster to hold the phone in place.  So back it goes and I wound up with the Seidio Innocase Holster which works quite well.  The Seidio with the Incipio NGP case make for a great combination.
2	I like the clip style and the leather is nice. Fit is snug for my iPhone 4S without any protective skin or surround.  There is no way to use anything more than a screen protector with this case as it doesn't allow for more thickness.
0	I acquired this headset whenSOCOM: Confrontationwas first released and thought I was getting a deal by getting the game AND the headset for about $60.  I couldn't have been more wrong.As headsets go I have worn a LOT of them.  I've owned old-fashioned wired headsets pre-bluetooth wireless that communicated with a little receiver you clipped to your belt and plugged into your phone and of course... plenty of bluetooth sets.Let me start by saying that you do NOT need this headset for a PlayStation3.  In theory ANY bluetooth headset will work with a PS3.  (Granted some won't because bluetooth is inherently buggy technology.)  Likewise this headset will work with almost any bluetooth phone.  However my personal preference is to have separate headsets because I don't like pairing and unpairing all the time.Having said that let's talk about this headset.  It is about as basic as basic gets.  If all you need is basic more power to you but you'll find similar quality for less money with other sets. Try theJabra BT4010 which as of this writing sells for half the price of the Sony.  Heck you can even find $10 bluetooth headsets if you really want to go cheap!Apart from poor value the Sony set is an awkward fit.  It has only a thin rubber ring around a little plastic barrel that is supposed to stay fastened in your ear.  Most other sets either have a form-fitted rubber piece or simply stay out of your ear altogether.  This design gets uncomfortable quickly because A) the part that goes in your ear may not be the right size for your ear and B) the over-the-ear loop is made of cheap plastic as opposed to being rubber or having a rubber coating like many other sets.The battery life is decent but nothing to write home about.  And the charging stand? It's cheap very lightweight plastic that falls over very easily.  If the USB cable is a little bit stiff the natural tendency for it to curl may very well topple the stand.As for sound quality... yeah basic again.  Sure it works but once again it is very basic.  I felt like it didn't have a very good range of volume.  Many times I had it cranked to the max and still could barely hear.Since games are usually $60 and this headset came bundled inside a $60 game I tried hard to find a reason to keep it after all wasn't it free?  In the end I could find no redeeming qualities and returned it rather than allowing it to take up space in a drawer somewhere.If you'd like some good places to start your search for another headset here are a few:Personally I just can't get over theJabra FreeSpeak BT250V.  It's so comfortable I don't even notice it's there and it also has a vibrating/call notification feature which is absolutely great for leaving your phone on the charger and keeping the headset with you at home or office.  As of this writing the Sony is ~$45 and the Jabra is ~$60.  You may find the Jabra cheaper but even at $60 it's DEFINITELY a better value than the Sony!If you're looking for a really great sounding bluetooth set (i.e. for listening to music) I've been really happy with theMotorola HT820.  It has two speakers and wraps around the back of your head/neck.  Fair warning though- the Motorola sounds awesome but the speakers are huge and wearing this set makes you look like a total dork.There are hundreds maybe even thousands of bluetooth headsets out there so no matter which one you finally choose please just don't make it this Sony piece of junk.  Your dollars will go farther on something with the same quality/lower price or same price/higher quality.
2	I recommend using this only as a microphone and setting your PS3 settings to have to sound that you would normally hear through the headset come out of your tv instead. That way you can have your microphone in it's dock and just talk into it that way. When I play with it in my ear it is quite uncomfortable. But the sound quality is great. If you buy this in the store it comes with short Micro-USB. My friend had bought this headset from GameStop or something and it came with different sizes of ear rubbers (or what ever you call them) I guess that makes it more comfortable. But hey for this price it's still pretty good!
2	Have had this for a couple years now (not purchased on amazon) and it works great but it hurts my ears where it hangs after using it for 30mins and is loose too.. bad ergonomics.
0	Unnecessary equipment for Ipod touch 2g unless your fingers are gigantic. Then maybe you might need this. I gave mine away.
2	This Stylus Pen is not going to work out well for use on my iTouch. The problem is that the rubber tip is not good for sliding on the touch screen so it sticks and skips on the surface. It also feels like pressing hard enough to make the sliding work (most of the time) is going to brake the iTouch and while I'm not sure how much pressure that would require I'm not going to chance it. It does work just fine for selection and pressing icons\buttons but that's about it.The Pen itself is a fairly light aluminum body with a handy pocket clip no complaints there.My search for a good stylus continues - Not Recommended!CFH
2	a tubular aluminum 4&#34; long stylus with a soft cushion for a tip.  Not really worth buying.  If you need a stylus do better research save your money & buy something better.
0	I bought a whole collection of various styluses for my iPod Touch. I've used Handspring and Palm PDAs for about 10 years (Visor m515 Zire 71 Tungsten TX) and just don't like using my chubby fingers for input on the Touch. These rubber-tipped styluses and their foam-tipped cousins don't do the job. The iPhone/Touch screen surface is not designed to work with a stylus. Finding a place to keep the stylus is also a problem. With a PDA there is a slot for it. For my iPod Touch there is no slot so the stylus is in my pocket not with the Touch. I tried using these styluses for a few days then gave it up and went back to my pudgy fingers. I could write five times faster using Graffiti but my Palm died and alas Palm no longer sells anything but phones.
2	for the price I paid...it is ok but the tip came off quite easily had to glue it back...I would recomend it...just be aware tip might come off...but again for the price you can not go wrong and it works ok. and yes I would buy it again
0	If you're looking for something to make using your touch screen easier to use....save your money.  This product does not work well at all.  You have to push hard on the screen (which can't be good for the screen) and is more of a pain than it's worth.
0	This thing won't slide on the screen at all. It's as though it were actually designed to grip the screen like a race car tire. Absolutely worthless for handwriting and almost impossible to use for drawing. All you can do is tap with it.It's not even worth $1. Just spend $10 on a real stylus that actually slides on the screen with minimal friction.
2	It's very touch responsive and well meaning but don't quite hold up with the resistant drag of the rubber tip.
2	This pen doesn't work very well at all. I have to tap the iphone screen several times so it will register the contact. The pen also needs to be completely flat on the iphone screen in order to work at all. The only good part was the price. You get what you pay for...
2	It works okay but not as well as the higher priced ones.  The firmness of the tip is key.
0	I bought this item for my iPhone and when it arrived suprise it does not work with the iPhone. It is also made of low quatity. Great price if it worked.
2	I am giving this product 3 stars for its classy styling. It does not really work with ipod 2g. Even my big fingers work much better.
2	Made it easier for my kids to use the iPad. Not good for fine touch such as drawing but good enough to select and type.
2	This is a nicely manufactured product looks good fine build quality. It just doesn't work well.As a general use tool for operating the iPhone 4 this is less useful than my fingertips. The spongy tip is too sticky and doesn't glide over the screen surface and it must be pushed on fairly firmly to register well with the screen sensor -- making it even stickier. It is fair-to-middling decent for tapping -- there's no sliding involved and substantial pressure.flicking and other dragging gestures just simply don't work well with this stylus.So unless you find typing and button pushing highly problematic on the iPhone 4 and don't mind carrying around a tool exclusively for those specific tasks I suggest skipping this. I have tried very hard to like my $9 rubber-tipped sticklet but... I don't.I find that a fingernail works better and doesn't take up pocket space.I recommend that you grow one fingernail slightly long. Index finger works well. It is good for precise tapping and yet will also flick and drag smoothly and effectively.Seriously it works better than this stylus.
2	I am so disappointed this phone did not work out.  I was highly impressed with the Nokia E71 except for one essential.  Due to a hearing problem I keep my cell phone on vibrate 100% of the time.  I tried this one in my pocket and in a good quality waist/belt case and could never feel it even though I'd just called it myself from our land line and knew full well that it was ringing.  Only when I held the phone in my hand directly could I feel it - vibration was exceptionally weak.Why so harsh if the rest of the phone is so good?  Because I can't conceive of a cell phone without a usable vibrate option.  Even if I had good hearing in both ears there are times when only the vibrate option is appropriate (school church work meetings etc.).  Without it I consider there to be no reason to own it.  No vibrate option makes for a no-go for me.I ended up getting a Blackberry Curve and really like it but I'd still rather have the Nokia E71 after only a couple of days using it - just as long as it had a decent vibrator.There is one be aware item with this phone - apparently NONE of the major US carriers offers this phone as an option.  I don't know why since T-Mobile does offer it in Europe.  But I was not deterred by that and found out that at least T-Mobile tech suppport can still be quite useful even with this phone (I had a data-transfer issue right after I got it and T-Mobile was able to get me through the issue quite satisfactorily.Bottom Line: except for the vibrator being very weak this would otherwise have ended up with at least a 4-star rating and very likely 5 stars.
0	I just got this last night and was really excited at first from reading all the great reviews from others. However I realized that it's not as what's hyped up to be.  The memory didn't come with the phone so I had to go out and buy one separately last night and then the map features doesn't even load but prompts many questions over and over again then it crashes.  Furthermore I had to open the battery case then disconnect in order for the phone to work again!  The GPS doesn't work either since I have the old AT&T; service and I don't have the data plan.  I thought the GPS was a feature like you get from buying GPS separately in which it doesn't require internet service but satellite only. The short-cut email feature doesn't work either! I tried many ways to get it right but it keeps prompting me with same messages over and over again. So I had to log on to the web site feature then log into Yahoo then get my email that way so what's the short-cut feature for if it doesn't work? Also I had a difficult time to find where to delete the email account once you created one??!!  The number buttons are really small so when you just want to dial a number you really have to look for the right button to push.  All other features and icons are really small as well and too many to really understand which one is which.  I guess I'm used to having iPhone's bigger icons and user friendliness and now this Nokia is a big disappointment.  I wouldn't be complaining too much if this E71 hadn't been over $300 dollars. If it were only around $200 then I would give it an average rating instead of only one star. For $300 you can do much better. In fact iPhone is only couple hundred more and worth it. I just didn't like the battery life on iPhone so I gave this E71 a try.  Before I close I should mention that the camera/flash seems to work fine and the battery life on E71 seems to be awesome and long lasting once you fully charge it.  I may just get the cheaper version of the Nokia since I can't use email map and GPS features from this phone.  So beware of these complaints before you order this phone for $300.Edit:Someone responded to my review by saying that since I didn't have a data plan I couldn't download maps and emails.  That's true but I was logged on with Wi-Fi and it still didn't work whereas with iPhone I didn't have any of those issues.
0	I bought this Nokia E71 for Straight Talk service. I thought this was the best phone in the world until it started givi g me problems 1 1/2 weeks later. I took it back got another one and within 3 weeks it gave me the same problems. By then I could only return itto the phone company. And boy did I return it about 6 times. Getting new phone back each time. The last time 1 month ago they sent me a refurb phone well it was about 3 weeks ago. Now my phone wont turn on it couldnt find memory card it gets hot it freezes all the time when you reset it you lose the main app ovi store now i have to send itback again. Im very upset with Nokia.This is the worse Nokia phone I ever had. Its ashame too becausethis phone had it all. If only it could just work. I looked on Nokia forum and everybody s complaining about the same issues. Everybody and its not only with this model its with other similar models too. Nokia please fix it. Bacause right now your at the bottom. Im really about to find another service provider due to this. Anybody know a phone company with unlimited everything for a low price who makes good phones let me know.
2	Based on all the reviews I had seen of this phone I am really under whelmed by the actual product. I have used a Motorola Q9h and really wanted something  that could connect to WiFi.  While the E71 does that it does not offer much more.  It has a few nice features but there are many things that make you wonder what Nokia was thinking.Pro:Build quality is greatEasy set up auto wizards did everythingBrowser is greatCall quality and signal is good (better than some LG phones but no better than my Q9h)Menu system is very good (much better than Windows mobile which hides so much).Lots of option for pic takingPC Suite is a nice free app for syncing -integrates well with OutloolGPS with Google maps is very quick to pick up signalNice to have a phone w/o all the garbage they put on the ones you get from the network operators.Syncs Outlook notesCons:Sending and deleting emails should be easier they make it a 2 step process.  I do a lot of email and this is a major disappointment.When using IMAP for mail no way to move emails to other folders.Categories for contacts does not carry over from OutlookNo ability to filter contacts you must use groups.  Unable to set a default groupDoes not play quicktime or windows media video filesPic quality is just ok color are really off unless the light is greatSignal strength meter is almost impossible to readLimited ability to customize home page no ability to add shortcuts to non original apps (lots of plug ins for Windows mobile allowed much more flexibility)Enabling call forwarding is a very involved processAlarms are not well done.  You can not save an alarm turned off.All in all I like the phone but am not sure there is much of an improvement over the Motorola Q9h.  Generally better menu system but email is a weak point on the E71.  If you are a light email user and are looking for a good looking phone the E71 is a good choice.  If you are a heavy email user go with either a Blackberry or Windows Mobile phone such as the Motorola q9h
0	I bought this phone from Amazon.com. This is an AT&T phone with Logo on the phone. It is not a truly unlocked phone. The SIM restriction has been removed. You will be able to make and receive phone calls with most sim cards. You will not be able to send or receive txt mms email use data no gps no internet wifi becomes unusable. Had to return this item. You can buy a featureless sim unrestricted phone for $15-$20 in Amazon.com or online auction sites. Very disappointed.
2	I have owned the e71x for over two years.  I still have it and will probably use it until it dies. This phone has one shining feature; it is as tough as nails! I love the size features and durability of the e71x. But all is not perfect in paradise.  Although this phone has a lot to love it has a lot of problems.  So here is an idea of what is like to own the e71x.THE THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE E71X:1. The OS:  Nokia stopped supporting the Symbian S60 3rd Edition OS almost immediately after they released it.  There are lots of glitches with this OS that need to be fixed via updates but Nokia does not care.  There are thousands of e71x users like me that have begged them to fix the problems with this OS and we get no response. The e71x hit the market about the time of the Iphone and it did not get the huge reception that Nokia wanted so the just abandoned it. That really stinks and shows poor character for a large company like Nokia.2. App Support:  If I were going to buy this phone again I would buy the e71 and not the e71x.  The e71 and the e71x are identical except for the OS.  Somehow even though they claim to have the same OS (Symbian S60 3rd Edition) some apps that will go work on the e71 will not work on the e71x. So there a lot fewer apps for the e71x.  But what really irritates me is that of the few apps that are available for the e71x 9 out of 10 are not stand alone apps but require network data support to even start up.  So if you are like me a person who thinks it is dumb to pay $60 a month for a data plan on a phone that has wifi then you will be ticked to find that most of the apps for the e71x require a data plan.  I don't mean that some of their feature will not work if you don't have a data plan I mean that they will not even start up if they don't find a data connection. And just in case your are thinking of it; no they will not recognized a wifi connection. So after two years of owning this phone I have only found a couple apps that will work on it without a data plan.  I can tell you positively that they people that engineered the OS for the e71x deliberately made it in a way so as to force you to buy a data plan.  I paid top dollar to buy my phone so that I would not have pay for a data a plan that I would not use.  It really really chaps me that AT&T; and Nokia conspired together to do what they did.3. Battery Life:  The battery life of the e71x is pretty bad.  I seldom make it through a day without having to charge my phone. The most I get out of it is a couple hours of talk time.  I have bought new OEM batteries for it but they die just as quick as the old ones.  And just wait until you turn wifi on.  Oh my!  You can literally watch the battery meter go down.  I am not sure what kills the battery so fast because this phone has a relatively large battery pack compared to other phones I have used.  For one thing there are no manual controls for screen brightness. The e71x relies on a light sensor to adjust the the screen brightness but it has never worked on my e71x so my screen is always at it's brightest.  There is a slider control to adjust the sensitivities of the light sensor but adjusting it has no effect on my phone.  Lots of other people have complained about this to Nokia but as I have said before Nokia does not care.  Oh and the phone has a light breathing function when not in use that is impossible to turn off.  Basically the phone sits there and slowly lights up and slowly dims as if it is breathing. So even when you are not using it it running the battery down.4. Wifi:  The wifi card on the e71x is pretty weak but it does work (for the 20 minutes you have battery life). The problem with it is really related to the OS.  The e71x has three idles screen themes (really should be called Layouts) and on each of the three themes appears a link to your wifi function.  So say you are sitting in a Burger King and want to check if there is a wifi hotspot.  You can quickly whip out your phone click on the wifi link and be scanning for a signal.  Great right? Well unfortunately that link causes your phone to crash three to four times a day in what is call the infamous Idle Screen Theme Error.  The phone will crash sound an alarm and then give you the Idle Screen them error and then come back online.  At first you don't notice anything wrong with your idle screen theme until you try to use your wifi.  That is when you notice that the wifi link is gone.  You then spend the next three days trying figure out what has happened only to discover that you have once again been the victim of the glitchy Symbian S60 3rd Edition OS and that Nokia has no plans to fix the problem.  Now you are stuck with having to dig five menus deep into the phone settings to get to the wifi function or go through the process of resetting your idle screen theme several times a day.5. GPS:  The e71x does have a gps but it might as well not.  It takes no less then 5 minutes for it to find satellite signal if you are standing dead still in the wide open. But the really bad thing is that I have not been able to find a single stand alone app that will work with the GPS that does not required a data plan. If you have a data plan and are willing to stand out in the open for five minutes every time you want to use the gps I guess it might work for you but for me it is useless.6. Camera: The camera on the e71x is pretty bad when compared to other cameras of other smartphones with 3.2MP cameras.  Have even seen 2MP smartphone cameras that do better.  I actually used a panel made up of some friends to judge the quality of two other smartphones (3.2MP & 2MP) against the e71x.  The e71x lost hands down.  I seldom use it as a result of the poor quality.THE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT THE E71X:1. Size and Durability:  The e71x is a brick. It is really small for all the features it has and it is built more sturdier then any other smartphone I have held.  This was the main reason I bought the e71x in the first place and it has not disappointed me in this regard. I bought a slim anti-slip gel case for it when I first got it and it has been great.  It has fallen a few times on concrete but the phone still looks and functions like it did when it was brand new.2. Keyboard & Buttons:  I am a big man with fat fingers.  At first I though I would have a problem with the small keyboard on the e71x but after a few days of break-in time I was typing away.  Like the rest of the phone the keyboard and the buttons feel solid and after two years of heavy use still look brand new.  Not one single letter or symbol is faded.3. Screen:  The screen is bright and sharp even if it is small (you can't have everything).  I have used screen protectors from day one and it still looks great.4. Advanced voice calling support:  I hate holding a phone to my ear so I use a bluetooth 99% of the time.  I also hate having to pull my phone out of my pocket and look through my address book (over 300 entries) to find a  number to call.  But I don't have to because the e71x has advance phone calling support. I just have to push and hold the button on my Plantronics Voyager PRO Plus headset and speak the name of the person I want to call.  Wallah!  That is as easy as it gets.5. Text to Speech Function:  The e71x has text to speech functions and will speak out the name of the person calling if they are in your address book.  So say you are driving your car and your phone rings.  It's in your pocket and it is difficult to get it out to see who is calling.  Not a problem with the e71x.  It rings and then says the name of the person (if they are in your address book).  If the call is from someone not in address book it just rings but this tells you that you don't know the person that well and you can decide to let them leave a voicemail if you don't want to take an anonymous call.6. Bluetooth:  Unlike some phone that don't like (or are software restricted from) transferring data with other Bluetooth devices the e71x seems to be able to connect and transfer to any other Bluetooth device that will talk to it.  I Like freedom and hate it when manufactures restrict their products to work only with in their engineered limitations (I am talking about you APPLE!).Well that is about it.  You should know all you need to know about the e71x now.  If this phone had a better OS (or at least better support from Nokia) better camera better battery life and better apps support it would be a five star phone.  That being said it is still pretty darn good phone for phone and texting functions and I would not shy away from buying another but never at full price again.
0	They can be used to scroll up and down lists but when you try to type with these stylus' they won't work.
2	It's cheap and functional. What do you expect for a penny per item? Got one each for me and my wife but we don't use them anymore. With the iphone you get used to using your fingers pretty quickly. For other devices this might be OK otherwise don't bother if it's for the iphone.
2	Does the job not so easily. Sometimes you really have to use the force. Much easier to use your finger. Did throw it away.
2	Just generic made. Does it's job but is bad quality. Will bend or ends will fall off. 3 stars for that
2	I had that item for more then a year and only used it once. iPhone is working just fine with using your fingers (as intended).
2	This product isn't worth the money. You have to press pretty hard to get it to pick up and when you do the crappy tip compresses and scrapes the also crappy metal of the case into the screen.
0	Don't waste your money. First you can't keep track of it. Second if you have it it dragges across the screen and the end of the tool is too wide. Then what do you do with it to keep it clean??  lost it again....
2	This is not convenient to use as there isn't a place to store it. The iPhone is so sensitive to the touch it's easier to just use my fingers...
2	It works buy it's not as stylish as other stylus I have seen and that makes me want to purchase another. One with say more style and possibly a pen or a light attached.
2	This stylus comes apart really easily and feels super cheap.  I ESPECIALLY would not recommend it to people with small children around
0	I had no luck with this.  The order was lost but the friendly customer service people sent a replacement immediately upon notification...and added a second free one...so no complaints there.  One of them fell apart after a couple of days and neither of them worked well.
0	Doesn't work with an Otterbox Defender case! Never tried it without so 1 star is all I know to give.
2	The product is well made but does not work with iPhone. You can type if you press really hard.  But you can no navigate or flick the screen.  Therefore it doesn't work.
2	In an effort to find something to use instead of my fingers for certain things on my phone I figured this was a good buy.  When using this it was a little difficult to use and would not even work so even though it was not expensive save your money for something else.
2	This cable is pretty big but the reason I give it two stars its because it works sometimes and mostly it Doesn't.
0	I was very impressed with the seller's delivery. My item arrived a month early. However the product had problems. Both ends of the splitter cable were loose when I connected my headphones and did not stay in very well on their own. One of the ends on the splitter cable did not work. I would ship back and demand a replacement but the cost to ship it back to Hong Kong is way more than the $1.10 I paid for it. Overall I do not recommend this to anyone and I will not be ordering from this seller again.
2	You get what you pay for the chords are quite large and seem like they might come apart but it will work for as long as you need.
0	Unfortunately one side of the splitter doesn't work. I don't recommend it since it takes more work to ship it back than to throw it out and buy another one.
0	I bought this to split the audio from my computer to two sources seems simple enough but after a while we noticed only the right channel was working so I unplugged the splitter to find the tip of the plug (approx. the first 1/8&#34;) had broken off inside my computer audio port.  Not only did ruin the plug but now I can't plug any other jacks in to the computer audio outlet port because the broken piece is stuck in there.  So now my computer is permanently crippled and limited to one channel due to this poorly made product.  Remember you get what you pay for!
2	It took about a month to get the Y Splitter cables.  I ordered them for a trip 3 weeks ahead and these cables still didn't show up.  I ended up going to Walmart to buy the Y splitter cables.  Avoid this seller if you plan on getting these cables anytime in the next 30 days.
2	case is great metal clip is not!  I ended up drilling a small hole and using a rivet to keep the metal clip together.  The fabric part of the case is great. fits great phone secure!
2	Didn't fit my iphone 5c in the Lifeproof - at least not without way too much pushing and pulling.Like all Maxpedition gear I've gotten it looked great and I'm betting it's as bomb-proof as the rest of the line....didn't work for me...but if it does for you it's a good deal.
2	the belt clip will only work on a belt with dificulty. the arm band is small too tight for my biceps.  oK FOR A CHILD. tHE CHARGERS COVER AND CABLE IS WORTHWHILE
2	I mostly bought this assortment of Sansa Fuze assessories for the chargers and cords.  I had hoped the case was worth it but was disappointed with the quality and lack of usefulness; I didn't even install it on my Fuze.  However I'm good with the chargers and like the USB plug that makes it compatible with my other electronics.As most purchasers of Fuzes know it's hard to find a good protective case with belt clip.  I finally found one called a 3-1 case that has an external case that will hold the player earbuds and other small assessories.  The case also comes with a leather protective case for the Fuze.
2	This charger is not the most reliable in terms of performance.  I can't always get the charger to charge my phone and even when it does charge it is very slow.  It is very inexpensive but other than that I wouldn't recommend it.
2	I had to buy a third battery for my blackberry phone less than one year. I'm not sure why I have to keep buying batteries for my phone. Seems to me the other batteries were old or weak.  I hope this one works longer than the others. But I'm glad my phone is working again.
2	After reading the reviews of this supplier I needed one battery but ordered two.  It was a good move because one of the batteries received was dead on arrival.  The second battery works fine.
2	First of all this is sold for exactly the same price at the Apple stores. Unless you live far from one you can save shipping and just pick these up there.Second charging $15 for two pieces of plastic film is a bit much. Having said that they do work very well. Not only do they function as anti-glare films (they are matte) but they also make your finger slide across the screen much more easily at least for me. The problem is that they don't last forever: they do build up dirt and will get scratched and messed up on the edges over time. This is a problem because at $7.50 a pop it adds up over time. You're possibly better off buying the much cheaper alternatives which cost pennies. The idea of a premium plastic film is a bit odd isnt' it?
2	The case is not what I expected and i feel like it won't protect my phone so I won't be using it. The shipper was great though would buy from this company again
2	The Ionic Guardian case for the iPhone 5 is aptly named.  Although stylish inexpensive and ergonomically designed the plastics that make up the two-piece (a soft inner sleeve and a hard back-only half sleeve that slips over it) case unfortunately pick up a static charge each time the encased phone is slid in and out of the back pocket where I keep it.  This results in the iPhone 5's glass screen being perpetually dusty and in need of a wipe.  I'm certain that it's the case that is the cause because I did a two day test removing the case to see if the dust accumulation would go away.  It did but returned instantly when I put the case back on.  Not a disaster but not something that I am particularly happy with.  I suppose I will eventually try another case when I get fed up with cleaning the screen all the time.J.M. Tepper
2	This product works okay.  It fits just fine but is a little bulky and not exactly what I was wanting.  It doesn't protect the screen like similar units.
2	It looks beautiful in person. It's light and stays out of the way. But it doesn't work all that well. You see the inside of the cradle is slick so smooth in fact that if you casually place your Blackberry inside of it it will fall over. So slick that when you put your Blackberry in and plug it up you have no way of knowing for sure if the device has made contact with the two prongs (see product image) that allow it to recharge. So you've got to lean in and look on your Blackberry to see if the lightning bolt which indicates charging is actually on. But be careful don't bump your desk - you may knock the device out! Or you may make it slip off the two prongs. lolA better idea would have been to place a rubber of matted plastic inside the charging pod to keep your BB firmly in place.Oh - since it doesn't sync while you're using the pod to charge sometimes I sit it in the pod/cradle and plug it directly in the BB so it can sync but sit upright. Bad idea. The weight of the power cord on the side of the BB will cause it to slip out of the SLICK pod. ....Luckily I paid way below retail. Or I would be pretty upset.
2	I should have read more close.  This unit will NOT sync your BlackBerry it will only charge it.  Other than that is was inexpensive and worked just the way it should.
2	If you only want a desktop charger this is okay. It only charges the phone and the charger has to be hooked up to a USB port on a computer. It doesn't allow access to the phone through the Blackberry Manager. If you want to charge your phone use the cable provided and keep your desk clear of this charging pod.
0	The point of a case is to protect your phone.  This case does not do that well.  I had been using it for a couple of weeks and it worked fine.  I didn't like that I could not dock it with the case on but that is just nit picky.One day I was sitting on a curb waiting for a taxi to take me to the football game when my phone slid off my lap.  It fell a total of 6-12 inches max.  It landed on the bottom corner and the case just split open.  Either side of it fell off and my phone then landed on the front glass CRACKING THE SCREEN!  After much reading I found that these screens are pretty durable so I assume it was a fluke and must have hit a small pebble just right.  Either way if the case would have done its job right and not fell off my phone would not now be cracked.Luckily the phone works fine just has a large crack which is more of an annoyance and weak spot if any.  Thanks to Apple and AT&T; to fix this costs ~$200 so that will not be happening.  I ended up getting the griffin easy dock case and it works great and is much more of a sturdy design.
0	I agree with all the positive points that the other reviewers have said. This could be an ideal case but after only 2 weeks the clips that hold the two halfs together started breaking. I kept it together with electricians tape until they all broke off. Bargain cell was great and immediately sent me a replacement but after 2 days already one cip broke. Unfortunately without the clips the thing doesn't work. I'd gladly pay a dollar more to have the clips work properly but as it is I've ordered a silicone case.
2	Not the best case but I dropped my phone a few times and it never broke.  The case is bulky though.
2	This is a good looking case but doesn't seem to offer much protection as it comes apart when dropped.  There are two vent holes in the back of the case that allows dust to enter and potentially cause scratches.  Also purchase from one of the other sellers not Accessory Export LLC as their processing/ delivery time is very slow.
2	This product didn't even last me 2 weeks.  I never dropped it and it usually stayed in my purse or on my desk but it started cracking around the connection areas. I had to order another cover to replace it.  I'm now using the Belkin Vue and it's working out great.
2	I wish there had been some reviews to read before I bought this!  Basically it does what it says.  It protects your privacy.  No one can see the screen unless they're pretty much directly in front of it.However... this is a two-piece set.  It comes with a glossy screen protector that protects the whole front of the iphone.  You're supposed to put that down first then put the privacy film on top of it.  I did it backwards and that screwed everything up.But even if you did it right here are the four problems associated with it:1. the film is quite thick - try to picture this - it's about 3 times as thick as the glossy screen protector (the standard screen protector that comes with or without the privacy film).  Keep in mind the glossy screen protector is super thin and when you have that on your phone you hardly notice it.  The privacy film though is thick enough that it creates a ridge that your finger can definitely feel as it runs across it.(By the way the privacy film just covers the lighted part of the iphone screen - not the entire face).  So the privacy film sits on top of the glossy screen protector - and there's this ridge there.  A ridge that can get caught on things when you put the phone in your pocket or purse.  I'm sure it won't last long in daily use.I accidentally installed all of this backwards from the way they recommended.  I put the privacy film down first then the glossy protector on top of it.  It works okay and it eliminates the ridge problem.  The film will now not get caught on anything and ripped off because it's covered by the glossy protector.  However the glossy protector doesn't fit over it perfectly - leaving a lot of bubbles outside of the screen area.  This is no doubt why they recommend installing it the other way around!2. The privacy film really dims your screen.3. With this doubling up of films and protectors the screen loses a noticeable amount of sensitivity and you have to press harder for it to recognize your commands.  This is really a pain after awhile.4. The privacy film got a tiny little bubble that just won't go away.  I can push it around with my thumb but it just comes back when I'm finished!It sounds like a great idea in theory but I'm not sure in practice it's really going to be worth it.  I find myself now weighing the benefits & costs.Benefit:  no one can see my screen but meCosts:  I have to look at a much darker screen there are little bubbles that can't be removed and the whole thing's not going to last very long anyway!Then I think:  privacy protection sounds good but really - in real life - how often has my privacy been violated by someone looking at my screen?  I'm not sure it has ever happened.  And if it did happen it has caused me no harm.  So why not just be careful whose around when you pull the phone out and dump the whole privacy film bit!
2	It sticks stays for a day and after that sides of it starts coming off. Doesn't matter how I installed itI tried everything...it still comes off. Not a good quality at all. I went and got protection sheets from AT&T store...the one I used a year ago still stays on and works great! Don't waste your money.
2	It protects the iPhone screen but I find it hard to install without creating bubbles under it. If there is any dust particles got under the screen when you put it on you will get bubbles.It does not last very long it looks like I may have to get another one soon.
2	Pros: Holds iPhone 3GS well (can even have a small silicone case on the phone and it will still fit). Good clip and great protection.Cons: It is not leather. It has a leather TEXTURE. Do not expect to receive an actual leather case. That being said I would imagine this case getting unsightly pretty quickly. I got this for my mom and she doesn't even use it. Which is not due to the case being bad or anything. She just prefers her otter case.
2	This case is a very tight fit for a naked iPhone 4 (without a case or bumper on the phone).  With a bumper on the iPhone 4 I could not get it in the case at all.  I ordered from SF Planet - other vendors may be different.
2	Original review posted in August of this year-I bought this case for my iPhone 3G and I am very pleased with it. The magnetic closure has not interfered with my iPhone in any way and the belt loops make this holster very very secure. The phone is easily removed when needed. I bought this to replace theDLO Leather Holster Case for iPhone 3G 3G S (Black) when the belt clip began to become loose; if you want to make SURE that you never loose your iPhone because of a lost holster the PC Microstore holster with belt clip AND belt loops is the way to go. I had the unfortunate experience of losing a Motorola Razr when another holster's belt clip slipped off my pocket; an honest person turned the phone in but not before it had been stepped on and the glass front broken. Do you really want to risk losing your Iphone in such an accident? At the offering price I feel that this iPhone case is one of the best deals available on all of Amazon's web site.Follow-up December 2009-My wife recently upgraded to an iPhone so I ordered two more of these cases still at a great price. While they seemed very similar to the items I received in August they are of MUCH poorer quality- the belt loops broke in a mere three weeks of usage. I have contacted pcmicrostore about a refund or replacement through Amazon and I'm waiting for their response. The cases received in November have a small logo on the front but the ones I received in August did not. I have resumed use of the case received in August which is somewhat worn and with stretched belt loops that are nevertheless still intact. It seems as though pcmicrostore has changed suppliers without bothering to let Amazon (or anyone else for that matter) know that they had done so. I can no longer recommend this phone case because of its poor workmanship.
0	The holster is too big for the iphone (3G) and does not have a snug fit. Found another holster that was smaller that I liked better.
0	WARNING: If you want to save your time money and iPhone never consider this crappy item.The holster has one metal clip at the center and two loop straps to hold a pants belt. The imitation leather skin is actually thin cloth sandwiching cardboard paper.In less than 3 days after my purchase one of the loop straps tore off at its stitches to the case body.Another 2 weeks passed and I found the metal clip was missing and the holster barely hanging with the remaining loop strap. I was only lucky I found it before my iPhone would fall onto a concrete floor.Nothing more to say.
2	This is a pretty good case especially for the price.  It does have some drawbacks though.I started with a DLO case for my iPhone.DLO Leather Holster Case for the iPhone 3G(Black)It was perfect:  Thin (close to the body) access to the headphone port while the phone was in the case and a big hole in the bottom to push the phone up out of the case.  That turned out to be a big key in how much I liked the case.  It was very easy to get the phone out with one hand.  The only issue I had with the DLO was that it had velcro to close the case.  I use my phone as my watch.  So it was distracting in meetings to hear that rip every time I wanted to check the time.So I tried this case.  The magnetic closure works well and it's quite.  It does have both a belt clip and belt loops--which added to the bulk and made the phone stick out more from my hip.  The biggest drawback (and why I'm looking at yet another case) is the the flap is too big and the hole use to push up the phone is too small.  So it is difficult to get the phone out with one hand.
2	I was looking for a horizontal holster with a magnetic clasp that could fit my iPhone in its protective case. This holster did the job and at such a great price. However the stitching on the belt clip and on the elastic on the end has started to come undone.Disappointing but what can I expect for a couple bucks?
2	This is an attractive case with a black vinyl exterior (NOT leather & I don't understand why Amazon allows this claim) & a padded yellow interior. The sides stretch & it was a good fit for my 3GS. The phone  is secured by a large flap & magnetic catches. There is a clip in the center of the case with loops on either side of it to attach to a belt. It can only be worn in the horizontal position only I prefer vertical. The clip is not very strong & will work itself free of the belt. I used to loops to prevent my phone from escaping (strange how they always manage to find a pool of water to dive into) but the loops broke after a few weeks. And the metal clip broke through the vinyl covering. So is it worth $3? Only if you plan on using it for 2 months.
0	This is crap.  The case is so small it does not fit the iphone or our vibrant.  The case they sent looks nothing like what I ordered.  It is small and has snap loops instead of permanent ones like the picture.  BUT IT WAS SO CHEAP it would cost more to return it than its worth.
2	Good case but bulky and too tight on the phone. Always had to force iphone and ends up giving this up due to this problem.
2	I like this case for my iphone.  It is quite handy.  It will please you.
2	I bought a this cheap case to basically protect the iPhone as I moved around. My iPhone is a 2nd Gen 8GB.It is a simple no frills case. Decent contruction and should last a while.My only gripe is that the case is about 1/4 inch too wide and 1/2 inch too long for my iPhone. If you need something more snug dont get this product.If you have your phone in say a silicone case or something the extra size might be a bonus to you.If you dont care about looks of the case and you can get over the oversize then this is for you.Overall the price and quality I would recommend it... The size? well...
0	you get what you pay for.... you pay cheap because it is cheap.... the leather texture is some sort of flimsy (not to mention) thin covering that peeled off simply trying to put this on my belt. its a basic pouch flap magnet design. To add insult to injury the magnet isnt even a strong one. dont know how many times my phone fell out of the case from actions as simple as getting into my truck and having it bump into the seat.
2	Unfortunately the material around the belt clip peeled away pretty quickly and the edges started to fray. For the price though you really can't beat it.
0	You have to get a very very thin case for it to work on this case. And the belt loops broke after 3 months of use. I got the Grantwood iPhone holster instead.
2	I purchased a case with the same description 2 years ago. In fact I just went back to my old order and clicked on it. While the price remained the same the item I got was not. The first was was clearly better material and design. This one after a few weeks slips off of my belt and is made from cheaper vinyl. Still somewhat a decent deal because if you purchased this at the mall it would be more like $7-10
2	its ok s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s sssssssssssssssssssss sssssssssss ssssssssssss sssssssssss s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s sssssssssssssss
2	It worked great at first. I really liked the belt clip so I only used that.  But after a few months the leather on the metal clip came apart so only the metal was out which was tearing up my belt. so now I am forced to use the straps which work fine but this means I can't take the holster off without also taking off my belt.  Which makes my kids laugh b/c I undo my belt when I walk in the house after work.  If you mainly use the belt loops this is a fine product at a great price.
2	I don't know the final verdict on whether or not magnets affect the iphone. Some people seem to think they do some don't. I noticed none of the cases on the Apple website have magnets. But what I couldn't find was a belt clip case that would fit a phone with a skin on it except for this one. I didn't want to spend $50 on a case from the Apple website to find out it wouldn't work. Of course I had already ordered this case when I found out about the magnet conspiracy.So for $7 with shipping I decided to give this a try. But I didn't want to fry my phone with a $7 case. So I cut the magnets out and bought some 3M Velcro stickers with permanent adhesive. I put the velcro over the spots where the magnets were. So far they work great. I imagine they will need replacing over time.I have an iFrogz case on my phone and it fits in this case just fine. Snug but not too snug. I don't think the phone would fall out with the flap wide open. The clip is very secure I don't see it falling off but I like the security of the belt loops.Quality seems to be good enough for this price range. This case with velcro would be perfect.
0	This case does not fit Blackberry storm although the seller claims it does.The case is too small for storm with Silicone skin and too big for naked storm (the phone bangs side to side).
0	Either by a poor decription or confusing pictures by Amazon I ordered this case for an iPhone 4. It is much too short. When looking at the various views there are no less than 3 different items shown. I hope I can get my money back which is mostly in shipping. I cannot comment on the quality of the case as it does not fit.
2	First of all referring to the pictures posted above the second one is not the same item as the first picture.  Here's a review I did for exactly the same case that is falsely advertised as leather: I've had this for exactly 1 year for my samsung blackjack 2 and it's not real leather. Started to have a couple of tears where the flap folds and i can clearly see that it's not leather. Also the seams where the opening at the bottom has come apart and also reveals synthetic materials. It's starting to look old so I'm looking for a real leather one. The hole doesn't line up for my phone. The belt clip seams have also come apart and metal part is exposed so I patched it up with some black duct tape and works ok now.
2	If you can fit that many cards in this case it wasn't the one I received. Not a very durable product. Belt loops and clip poorly stitched. It didn't last a month. I am glad that I didn't spend a lot.
2	This product is as described but I must not have pictured it correctly in my head. The picture provided makes it look like it holds quite a few cards when I would say 2 is the MAX. The phone will go in but it is tight so if you are trying to pull it out in a hurry forget it. If you are looking for something to hold your phone and drivers license this would be the product for you. I will say the quality of the material seemed to be very good however I gave mine away as it was not what I was looking for.
2	While the extra pocket might seem handy I can keep everything else in my wallet. What I wanted was a holder that wouldn't fall off my belt. This one has belt loops; but the Case Mate one has a clip that is so strong it stays put too and that one has a more sturdy case a phone cover and a free screen protector. Case mate is better.
2	Simple! Basically it can be paired with any BT transmitters (iPod Mac & PC) easily which is good right?! Sound quality - heh! Good not great that's for sure! I wasn't expecting much to be honest. I really like all those sound and light notifications. Nice facade and wi-fi range too! I wouldn't use it to listen to your music in particular but it works just fine for live radio shows and TV broadcasts where you really don't give a damn about sound quality.
2	Pros1)  Compact design.Cons1)  Sound quality is scratchy.2)  Speakerphone function does not allow to answer incoming calls suing skype.
2	Sync with iphone 4 without any problems.  BT link only a very short distance like 2 ft (not sure if this is the norm) but was hoping to be able to move speaker from room to room while the iphone stays in one place.Please do not expect the sound quality to be like your $5000 stereo system you will be very disappointed.  Sound quality is like a low end logitech computer speaker.  Its better than your laptop speakers and better than the iphone's built in speakers.  Controls work great and was able to make and receive phone calls with it.
0	Easy to follow instructions and may actually work with a phone but would not pair or connect to my mac laptop which is what I bought it for. Very disappointed in Amazon as nowhere on the first 2 pages is there any mention that this piece of junk is a bluetooth technology item. 4 pages in there;s mention and reviews but should have been labelled Motorola Bluetooth Speaker. Also in fine print on box is statement you might have to buy a bluetooth adapter for pc so I assume for mac also. Waste of time and I also expect to be hit with return postage for an item not designed for the purpose I purchased it
0	Bought this and it broke. I don't even know why I wasted my time wasn't even that long of a cord... Purchase this for your phone!B00DV2OQFYthe product is way better and is actually correct length & durability.
2	its exactly what it looks like and it does its job...theres a billion of this things in the world...i dont know if we need more.
2	If you are interested in this product then be sure to read the 3 star reviews. I made the mistake of not doing that I do not know why they gave it 3 stars when they state obvious flaws that make the case not worth having.My case broke after 2 weeks and I never even dropped it. It's a snazzy looking case and looks nice on the phone but it has to many flaws.It comes in 2 pieces and when you put it on your iphone it connects in the middle. That is the biggest flaw. Most people hold their phone by the middle not the ends. So when you grab the phone or move it around in your hand/pocket you tend to disconnect the pieces.The other issue is the connecting flaps that plug into eachother to complete the case. They are flimsy and will break easily after reattaching many times. My right side flap has already broken off and now its chipped where it was. Also the color blue is wearing off on the back of the circle already.DO NOT BUY.
0	I bought this case because I wanted to purchase a sturdy reliable case for my iPhones 3gs. This case is terrible. It not only lets in dust and dirt that will scratch the back of your phone over time the 2 parts that allow the case to fit together always come apart. The plastic that the case is made from is also very brittle. it eventually begins to chip away over time thus leaving areas of your phone exposed. It's a terrible case and a waste of money!
0	I bought this cover with my phone at the att store. I liked the design of the cover and that there was virtually no lip between the cover and the screen. However I really disappointed with this cover. Here's the main problems I have with it:1. It doesn't fit over my screen protecter very well. One corner of the screen protecter keeps coming up.2. It's leaving marks on my phone. When I took the cover off the other day I saw that it had rubbed the red coloring onto my phone. Luckily this wiped off but I don't like the fact that its rubbing against the phone.3. This is my biggest problem with the case. IT DOESN'T STAY ON!! This case does not lock together and it is constantly coming apart. I find that if put my phone in my pocket that when I pull it back up I end up pulling just the case and not the phone. What good is a case if its constantly coming off!I do not like this case and would not suggest anyone to buy it! I would suggest finding one that either slips over the phone (like the gel type covers) or one that truly snaps around the phone.
2	I bought both my wife and I one of these and we had a lot of trouble with the bottom portion coming off. If the button on the back had a slightly more defined edge it would probably stay on.On the other hand it did keep both of our phones (1-3G 1-3GS) well protected and looks nice.If only the dang thing would stay on!
2	The small piece  below the home button breaks right away. It also broke where it comes together so now the two peices slip apart all the time.
2	Color was beautiful but the quality not so much:-(  Thin plastic tabs on the sides that are supposed to secure the top & bottom sections broke in just a few weeks.  Now if I put the phone in my pocket it usually comes out missing a piece....NOT a good look at all.
2	Update-I dropped this back down to 3 Stars . The first time my wife dropped her iPhone while using this case her screen shattered. She had her phone for two years without any problems and then within three-days her screen shatters.It could be a coincidence---------------------------------------------------------------------------------The iFrogs Luxe case works perfectly as inexpensive way to protect your iPhone. In addition to the case you will also receive a transparent screen cover. This will help to eliminate scratches to the front of your phone.A few other notes-- Very easy to install and take-off- A color for everyone- Does not hinder your camera- Comes with a screen protector- May need to be removed when you are using your iPhone with certain docking stationsFinal Verdict - I low risk investment that may help keep you iPhone intact!5 Stars
2	I picked this up just a few weeks ago and immediately put it on my phone.  I had been using theOtterBox Impact Case but wanted to test out something with a little less bulk.At first I thought I had broken the case not realizing that it comes in two pieces.  This is a nice feature because I have a couple of docking stations that don't work with a case and I usually have to remove it but with this case all I had to do was slide the bottom portion off.After less than a weeks time I noticed a few problems.  The coloring on the upper portion of the case has started to peel or scratch off.  Just a little at first but now I have about a 1/2 inch area that is gone. Additionally the daily removal of the bottom portion to use in my docking stations has worn down the clips that keep it connected to the upper part.  This has caused me to find my phone in my purse with no case whatsoever.All in all while the design of the case may be a plus the quality is a deal breaker.  Luckily the price I paid on this was less than $5 so I guess I got what I paid for.
0	bought 2 of these - 1 broke putting in on the phone. the other will not stay together.  Look elsewhere for a case.
2	But it offers protection from dropping. Be careful when you put it on because if you break the clip on the bottom/black portion then it won't stay on very well.  I like the texture and it slides in and out of my pocket well. I bought this one because my last one was a pain in the neck to get on and off.
2	This is a nice looking case but made of cheap plastic and not well formed. There are a couple of small plastic guide tabs that are supposed to fit under the split section of the case that I had to constantly push in to fit. But mainly it was unusable for me. I have a holster that I place my iphone into. Every time I remove the phone from the holster this case splits in half and leaves one side or the other in the holster. So it's completely useless to me.I got this on one of those Amazon Gold special deals so I was only out a couple bucks. I just threw it away. Still looking for a better case.As an aside I have now purchased 3 different Frogz products and each one has been total crap.
2	I was happy on the arrival of this case for my phone.  Immediately I opened it up and started sliding my iphone into the case only to hear the sound of a sand particle ripping away the clear coat and paint of my iphone 3G.  Fortunately for me I stop with a 1.5 cm scatch on my phone and before it reached the camera lens.Where the he-ll did they package these?  On the beach or some play ground?Besides that I like the case; however I saw glue marks on my phone when I remove it in order to put it into a phone holder in the car.  This is minor.
2	My wife and I each have one of these cases. We both love the bright vivid colors and the snug fit/feel of the case. My wife leaves her case on constantly and it is perfect for her. I however must remove the case at least 3-4 times a day as I can't use my favorite belt clip holder or my Griffin Aircurve with the case in place. The design isn't up to this. There are little tabs on one side of the case that must align perfectly to get a proper closure of the case. They are difficult to see and somewhat flimsy? And the first time that you think you have 'em aligned and push the two pieces together firmly the unaligned tab will become slightly disfigured making it even more difficult to get right. I have quit using mine for this reason. If you are mostly going to leave the case on Amazon has a great price on these and they do look really good!
0	Two things make me recommend NOT buying this case:1. The bump in the back that is apparently supposed to hold the two halves together: what it ends up doing is tilting the phone backwards slightly whenever you put it down which makes it that much harder to see the screen. (It also doesn't hold the two halves together).2. Every time I attach headphones the case slides up and I have to reattach it. This is beyond annoying.Another note: Because this case is listed separately for each color my bad review is only going to show up under pink unless I copy it to the other colors. There is NO difference between the various colors and one review would apply to them all.
2	The e-mail I sent to Phonenerds was never responded to. The case came close to the outside of the delivery deadline. The case fits on the phone and is loose.
2	This case does look nice but the connection between the two pieces is very flimsy plastic and fell apart after about a week.  I do not recommend this item.
0	The green color is really cute.  I bought it to replace a pink one that I bought at the AT&T store for much more money.  However the green case broke in the exact same places as indicated in the other users' photos.  This was within a couple weeks of getting it.  What the heck?  Thank goodness Amazon has an amazing return policy.  I was disappointed as the pink ifrogz case withstood a lot of abuse from my toddler.
2	I got this case when I first bought my iPhone at the AT&T; store. The orange upper half is pretty cool-looking and as many have mentioned here before I like how the front of the phone is somewhat protected from laying the phone on it's face or screen drops. The best feature of the case is the compromise between protection and size. It adds just a bit more thickness to the iPhone.Gripes? The orange half wears out VERY quickly. I had the case for a week and noticed that the finish got very scratched up near the edges revealing a silver base. Keep in mind that I put my phone in my pocket and have it next to either keys or coins (screen is of course protected by screen protector) so if you never have it near hard objects your case will fare better. The small tabs on the black half are very fragile and broke off after a couple of case removals. I returned the first one I bought after the bottom half kept on slipping off. The current one even though it's missing one tab still stays on the phone as it's supposed to.When this thing falls apart I will probably get another one unless there's a better product on the market.
0	The one positive thing I can say is that despite my expectations the thin piece of plastic over the front of the bottom piece hasn't snapped...yet. I got this case as a freebie when I bought my iPhone. My wife liked the color of it. Over the course of the next two weeks I nearly dropped my phone several times because the bottom piece slid off as I was taking it out of my pocket. It simply won't stay on. It's not very snug against the phone either. There are gaps at the top and bottom so when I plug in headphones or the docking cable it slides up and down in the case. Simply poor design. I got it for free and I want my money back.
2	I've had this for about 1 1/2 months and the little loop on the backside has broken off. However the case is still holding on snugly. It's protecting the back side of my iPhone pretty well. I usually keep the phone in my purse and I have probably removed the case three times to clean the crannies around the edge of the glass. The glass protector they ship is so far the best one I have found. I just wish they shipped more than one in the package.I wouldn't recommend if you regularly change your case because the loop on the back will break even quicker for you than it did for me. But it is doing it's job keeping my iPhone from getting scratched up. The green color is easy to find in my purse.
2	Well I really liked this case.  It has a nice dark color you can't really make out in the pic and it just feels good.  It slips right in a pocket yet it has a good grip in your hand.The slider style is nice because you can remove the bottom to place your iphone in it's cradle.  However in my case this is where the case failed.  From what I consider normal use the black plastic near the connection between the 2 halves cracked and broke off.  I found the extra piece in my pocket.  The case would not snap back together after that.  I'm still giving it 3 stars because maybe it was just an odd event and from a usability standpoint I really liked it.
2	I bought both myself and my girlfriend one of these cases... both of us take care of our belongings yet simply from pulling it in and out of our pockets the bump used to hold the top half to the bottom half wore down... After three months when reaching in my pocket for my phone I'd only get half of a case making me miss my calls.If you have an extra $10 bucks to spare it definitely will protect your phone... but you'll be forking out another $10 bucks to replace it in 2-3 months.
0	I made the mistake of purchasing one of these at the AT&T store for a ridiculous price compared to Amazon.  Perhaps for $10 it is worth having but my cases has already worn away the color around the edges of the screen from playing games and using the phone.  I haven't had it for much longer than a month and the wear started to show very quickly.  Now instead of looking like a cool metallic case it looks like a cheap while plastic case that was once painted a cool metallic color.  Not good quality.
2	I got this case one and loved it then got it a second time and it was a total piece of crap.  It lasted like 3 weeks.  The first one was great and lasted 6 months or more.  The second one would not stay together on my phone kept falling apart.
0	After just 2 days of normal use the blue paint begins to peel off! Silver-metal material is showing. It looks ugly! I would never buy it again.
2	SO I just got this today aug 25 08 and the back of it is not smooth like in the photo. The one I got has sort of a wood grain look to it. So before you order send an email first just to make sure you get the one in the photo.
0	I have iPhone 3GS in Outerbox protective case. This Armband Case is too small to fit with the Outerbox case and I don't want to take the Outerbox case every time I want to use the Armband. Waste of money.
0	I had no idea when purchasing this product that it would not fit on the arm of anyone under 400 pounds.  The band is not made to be fitted to anyone smaller.
2	This is the I get what I pay for. It is cheap looking and it is bulky. It looks better in picture. I will probably use it when people are not looking or where there is not a crowd. LOL.
0	I guess you get what you pay for... the Plastic does not work well with the touch screen.. now that really sucks... I tried cutting it out... afraid the iphone might come out....  So I'm back to just holding while running...
2	These cables work as advertised but they break with almost no effort at all.  Spend a little extra and get a good cable.
2	I carry my phone in my pocket.  the case is slim and has a great texture But the little clips that hold the case halves together started breaking after the second week.  Now a month later it's super glued together in three spots  :-{
0	What can I say? The clips to keep it tight broke after maybe one week of use.It was a cheap product but not even worth the value I paid for...Unfortunately not worth the shipment price either.Do not waste your money on this junk!
0	The Screen Protector Shield that is included with this case cover does not fit the iPhone 3G.  If you align it to the home button the Screen Protector Shield is too long on the bottom and covers the chrome trim.  If you align it to the bottom of the screen it covers part of the home button.There is also a weird cutout on the upper left which does not align with the cutout of the case cover.Additionally the Screen Protector Shield scratches VERY easily.If you're purchasing this case cover factor in the cost of purchasing a separate screen protector in the cost because the included Screen Protector Shield is useless.Also purchase from one of the other merchants listed besides PC Micro Store.  PC Micro Store's shipping is slow.  It took a week for me to receive this and I live in the same city as them.
2	I didn't like this prodct.  I dropped my phone on my carpeted floor and the corner broke so that I could not use the cover. The sheild was very hard to put on the screen.  It was very difficult to get the air bubbles out.  It also darkened tte screen on the phone.
2	I'm having to bend the side prongs in to make it fit without pushing extremely hard. With that said it charges and seems well made. The Motorola one I have is much easier to insert.
2	Poor quality and doesn't really attach to the headset sturdily.  I wouldn't buy one again.It does what it says but I wouldn't feel secure hanging this thing around my neck. (Plus you would look like a super geek doing it.) What was I thinking?
2	Does keep the earpiece from hitting the ground.  Not long enough though.  If they could make a longer version it would be great.
2	I ordered several different types of lanyards. This one fits into the USB port. It's not as convenient in my opinion as I have to remove it to charge the Bluetooth headset and I have some concerns about how secure the headset is using the lanyard. It seems to me that the lanyard could work itself out of the USB port which would defeat the purpose of the lanyard to begin with. I also have some concerns about overtime damaging the USB port. I prefer a lanyard that secures around the Bluetooth headpiece itself. Then I can go ahead and feel that the Bluetooth is secure and I can charge it without having to remove the lanyard. Overall I have no complaints about this product itself. The lanyard seems of reasonable quality and so does the point of attachment. I just don't think the design is the best in my opinion.
2	I got the micro USB Lanyard for my Backbeat 903/903+.as other reviewers told Micro USB Lanyard concept is really nice to keep the headset around my neckHowever1. The Micro USB connector is not secured to hold backbeat 903/903+ against gravity .So Backbeat 903/903+ is little heavier than to hold it via Micro USB connector on Lanyard.Easily take it off !!!2. Lanyard is short  should be little bit longer for my neck.I am not Giant but When I wear the lanyard with backbeat 903(+) the lanyard is little short...I love to have Backbeat 903(+) and keep update if any ...CheersT.Aoki
0	MY EARLOBE TURN RED AFTER WEARING IT FOR 1 HOUR. THERE IS NO PADS TO PROTECT THE EARLOBES. EVERY TIME WHEN YOU TURN YOUR HEAD THE WIRE STICK TO YOUR SKIN AND PULL ON THE EAR PIECES. SOUND SYSTEM CUT IN AND OUT. YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE EAR PIECES TOGETHER WITH YOUR HANDS ALL THE TIME IF YOU WANT IT SOUND CLEARER. WHO IS THE IDIOT THAT DESIGN THIS ?
2	I had previously tried both the Motorola S9's (failed after one use) and the S-9 HD's (failed after about 3 uses).  I replaced them with the Jaybirds and I have to say they are truly sweat-proof.  After several weeks of use now they are going strong without a hint of a problem.The sound quality is however a little disappointing compared to the Motos.  It's good enough for workouts and I will admit that I was aware that they have a reputation for mediocre sound quality before I bought them.  But I was a little spoiled by the excellent sound quality of the S-9 HD's (for half the price of the Jaybirds I might add).  I also bought a pair of the Acoustibuds mentioned in another post - they do help somewhat by providing a better seal in your ear but they don't attach very securely to the Jaybird speakers so I am sure it is just a matter of time until my little $15 pieces of rubbery plastic fall off and get lost before I have to go back to the stock ones.All in all I am happy with the Jaybirds because they do what I need them to do (i.e. allow me to listen to music while working out without failing every week).  But they aren't a particularly great value for the price.
2	Here we go...+++ The Pros+ Sweat and moisture resistant+ Comes with mesh pouch for easy carrying+ Charge stand uses standard mini-usb connection (easy cable replacement if lost)+ Pairing is easy and reliable+ Design is sleek and minimalistic+ Great sound and isolation--- The Cons- Buttons are hard to press- Frustratingly hard to get the earbuds to seat and even after they're seated they don't stay that way*** The DetailsI've gone through noise-cancelling headphones (Sennheiser PX200) and sound isolating earbuds (Shure E3) The Senns are nice but I find that carrying around the extra heft of the noise-canceling unit and wires to be more hassle than worth. So into the product researching fray I went and re-emerged with the Shures.The Shures are also great none of the heft and plenty of isolation (being ear-canal phones). But again WIRES!! Rolling them up when not in use untangling them when ready to use and the extra hassle in cold weather of figuring out how to stay tethered to my music player. Back into the frary...After some more product research I decided to go with the Bluetooth wireless option and at the time the only products that I could seem to find consistently decent reviews are the Jaybird JB-200 and the Motorola S9. Finally deciding on the Jaybirds based on all the positive media reviews on their website.Unfortunately I've never been able to get a good fit and I've read through the manual numerous times and watched the you-tube video with the CEO showing how to put them on all to no avail and the set ended up serving no other purpose than to waste space.The problem is the actual speaker; where other earbuds have a narrow speaker and the earpieces that fit over them are flexible material that compress into your ear and then flange out...The Jaybird has a flat and wide speaker (like 1/4 diameter) and with the earpiece on now you're looking at trying to shove something about 5/8 diameter far enough into your ear so it stays there.Sadly I'm not someone with an ear makeup that can accommodate that. And instead of Jaybird literature pushing how important a good fit is (which is incorrect because not everyone has the same ear opening) maybe they should try also suggesting that folks that can't pre-try the headphones find something of the same dimensions to test the fit first.
2	First let me say I like it but if you plan on using it with your iPhone and your iPhone has protective hard case (and some rubberized cases) it will not fit into the iPhone unless you remove the case.  I solved this by purchasing an adapter for $25-so add that to the cost of the 3G Juice if you use a hard case or a rubberized case in some instances.  It definately will not work with an OtterBox case.
2	It's hard for me to gauge the sound quality on this because it never stays in or close enough to my ear. That's due to the fact that the ear piece is much too large and slips off of my ear frequently. I made the mistake of buying two of these one as a gift for my husband and his keeps falling off his ear too although he is larger than me. We both went back to our Motorola bluetooths which are so comfortable you forget you're wearing them.
0	This was not worth the money spent it worked well but no quality on the design and durability. I asked for a refund but could not after 30 days.
2	I've tried a few bluetooth headsets over the last several years and suspect that the hype of bluetooth headsets is overrated across the board.This one is the best I've tried so far and it is worth the price.Pros: It works. Keeps a charge for two days even if I work in an hour long convo or two with family.Cons: Sounds tinny to the other end sound canceling feature doesn't do much for wind (but does work for road noise on highway).The on-headset controls don't thrill me but I also find that I don't need them. ymmv.I find that if I move my phone while it's connected to the headset that the person on the other end gets a ton of static. Also I can't keep my phone in a pocket and do housework or yardwork or something- the headset and phone have to be in close unobstructed proximity. Like the dashboard or the table next to where you're sitting.That said it's a workhorse headset that has increased my on the road focus and saved me some cell-to-brain radiation and definitely saved me some neck cricks. I use this headset almost daily have for the last two years and it's still going strong. I'd buy it again.
2	I'll keep this brief.Other headsets I've used: Several cheapos from woot.com Jawbone (original) Invisio G5 Jawbone Icon Jawbone Era Plantronics Voyager ProPROS1.) Comfortable2.) Battery life seems decent3.) Sound quality out of earpiece is fine4.) Handy base station for charging5.) Mostly performs like it's supposed to i.e. doesn't display any kind of buggy behavior (my biggest critique of my Jawbone headsets)CONS1.) Mediocre range2.) I get lots of static when I move around with the phone (tried it on a Palm Pre and a Samsung Galaxy S II) both with the phone stationary and with it in my pocket3.) My callers complain of static and background noise4.) Proprietary (i.e. not mini or micro USB) charging cable5.) A bit clunkyCONCLUSIONWhile this may have been a quality headset when it was released it's simply outdated now.  You can do better for the money.  I have snow tires on my car and the noise is loud enough that I can't use this headset while driving because my callers complain of the racket. My cheapo (&lt;$15) headsets perform equally well as this one.As of this writing (11/21/2011) I recommend the Jawbone Icon with Jabra eargels as the go-to headset.  If you want to throw more cash at it the Jawbone Era (also with Jabra eargels) is a better headset but perhaps not worth the premium price unless you plan to spend quite a lot of time using it.  The Plantronics Voyager Pro is also a significantly better headset than this one.Chris
2	I bought this product based on all the positive reviews I read but I was pretty disappointed by the product. First if you wear it on the opposite ear from where your phone is clipped you get a lot of static which never happened with my Motorola headset. Second having to fit the thing in your ear is a MAJOR hassle (it is designed to fit just inside your ear canal). Third it seems to have VERY poor battery life. I get about 1 day of standby and 1 hour of talk time. I was actually on the phone with someone a day after the thing was fully charged and hadn't used it to that point but yet it died out less than an hour into the conversation. The sound quality is decent but it doesn't make up for the shortcomings. I will say though that Amazon has pretty amazing customer service. I forgot to enter my new address into the order so it got sent to the wrong address but Amazon promptly overnighted me a unit free of charge.
2	My experience may be atypical but the battery on this headset stopped recharging after 6 months. I use two different types of charger bought at different times so I know the charger is not the cause.
2	I have purchased several headsets trying to find one that really works for me.  Most have not had a fit that was comfortable and solid feeling.  this one was different.  I do like the way it feels secure on my ear and the comfort is a good fit for me.sound is middle of the row.  It certainly is not as clear as my cell phone directly used but I get by with it.  Others say they can hear me ok but sometimes they report that I sound like I am speaking from the bottom of a fish tank.  For those few times that I need and use this device it meets my needs pretty well.  If you are looking for very good quality audio I would suggest looking elsewhere perhaps at a more expensive Jawbone or something.
0	I was told this was an excellent product by someone who owns it So I tried it. After trying two other bluetooth headsets before this I wanted one that people could finally hear me without background noise. This is not it. Everyone had trouble hearing me on it saying it was static and scratchy. I think its time to bite the bullet and get a jawbone.
0	When this product showed up it looked used. and by that it was not in the box properly it was missing the manual and the box was ratty.  Did not seem new at all.
0	Large ear piece did not fit in my ear. Very uncomfortable. Ear piece was broken upon receipt. Charger is not standard. Recommend that you keep looking.
2	I get noise when using this device. Also the people I talk to tell me they cannot hear me well. I'm returning this and ordering a different type. Except for the noise it works well. It holds the charge it was easy to pair with my phone an LG Rumor touch. It looks ok I can answer hang up and redial the last number without having to use the phone.
2	I had been very happy with thePlantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headsetwould have kept this one for years as it perfectly satisfied all of my needs. But I had an accident with the one that I reviewed here in 2009 so I decided to see what other Plantronics Bluetooth headsets were available.Picked up thisPlantronics Voyager 520 Bluetooth Headsetas it had been recommended by a friend as a reasonably priced alternative which it is.  It's certainly better than my older Motorola H500-series Bluetooth headsets but not quite in the same league as the Plantronics Voyager PRO series and for a number of reasons.Likes:+ Very simple setup and pairing; couldn't be easier+ Excellent battery life; easily meets 8 hours of talk time+ Comfortable earloop; swivels to fit either ear+ Excellent and clearly written instructions+ Works with Skype through the computer+ Good one-button controlsCompromises:* Wind noise higher than expected; oyager PRO series is far better* Moderate noise cancellation; Voyager PRO series is far better* Claimed range of up to 33 feet was rareDislikes:- High static levels; annoying to parties on the other end- Proprietary plug on the charger; should be a standard Micro USB- Junky plastic desk charging cradle; not worthy of the Plantronics name- Soft plastic separated on the earloop; had to fix with SuperGlue more than onceRegular Use:As noted in the beginning this was picked up as reasonably priced alternative to the Plantronics Voyager PRO series. I'm neutral on the design of this Voyager 520 though the chrome look could have been muted and not so glitzy but it was the ability to communicate and sometimes for extended periods that was important. In that this headsetdid well except for the occasional high static levels experienced where none had been there with the older Voyager PRO (and more on this later).But... the two-piece ear loop separated and had to be glued together and this had to be done a few times. Once I lost the soft plastic part for a couple of days and luckily found it. The last time I cleaned both parts carefully with isopropyl alcohol before using the SuperGlue and so far it has held. This is apparently a common problem as I found on the Plantronics site when I went to see if they had a tech solution. Plantronics needs to go back to the drawing board on this.But my biggest complaint is that this Plantronics Voyager 520 requires a proprietary plug for charging in a world that has gone to Micro USB plugs. In fact the Plantronics Voyager PRO HD Voyager PRO+ Discovery 975 Savor M1100 M100 and even their discontinued Explorer 240 360 and 390 all use the universal Micro USB plugs for charging so why should this model be different?  Plantronics needs to work on their charging connector.It may not matter that much but note that this Plantronics Voyager 520 Bluetooth Headset is listed here as Item model number: 75859-01. On the Plantronics site it's listed as P/N: 75859-01 and according to them  the Product is Discontinued so be aware of that.All this being said I moved on to thePlantronics Voyager PRO+ Bluetooth Headsetearlier this year and like it's earlier PRO series sibling it's a 5-star offering. The Voyager 520 has been set aside as a backup and so far it hasn't been needed.  I could have gone for thePlantronics Voyager Pro HDbut in truth didn't know if I would have used all of its extra features. There are other more economical models to pick from such as the highly-ratedPlantronics M50(which does have micro USB charging) but as a loyal fan of this company's products I would suggest steering away from this Voyager 520 Headset... you'll be happier with others.7/28/2012
2	Extremely disappointed in performance.  Literally would have to either hold the phone next to my ear or set it on my shoulder for the bluetooth to be clear without static.  Also if you moved more than 8 - 10 feet away it would literally disconnect itself from my cell. I took the cheap way out to buy an inexpensive bluetooth and I guess I got what I paid for and less.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!  The only positive thing I can say it was comfortable on my ear.
2	I have had many Bluetooth headsets and this one is one of the worse. So far my favorite is still the Voyager 510. This one is really terrible in that it picks up even the slightest background noise despite what Plantronics advertises it as a noise-cancelling headset it is completely the opposite. I even called them and they claimed it was defective and the replacement was no different. I will stick with the trusty Voyager 510.
0	Got it September 2012 the background noise was always horrible and became really bad when the phone was not close to the bluetooth device. If the device is in my right ear and my phone is in my left pocket the noise is unbearable. and after three months of use this thing dies under a minute of being connected to my phone.Guess you get what you pay for. I like how chunky it is because it stays put in my ear not like the new light ones that you don't know if they are on your ear or not.
0	Returned it It looks like and OLD HUGE Star Track headset ! Out dated Large and tacky draws attention thuggish looking . I didnt realize it was soo gaudy looking its HUGE the only reason I gave it 1 stars is it does work but I would not wear it to work or in public.... It should be taken off the market  I think but to each his own!  Huge and Shiney! lol!!!!!!!!
0	this itiem is terrible plenty of back ground noise and static. I ordered 2 and find this to be a hugh mistake.
2	I enjoy listening to Sirius Satellite radio on my old bluetooth headset but the volume was too low.  Since the Voyager 520 has a volume control I purchased it.  Unfortunately I didn't research well enough.  It lacks the feature of switching between calls and listening to media on your cell phone.
2	my wife did not like this headset as much as her old 510  no one really uses blue tooth headsets anymore though i stopped once i got my iphone.
0	It never felt good while wearing it.  Just painpainpain!!  Don't waste your money on this thing.  You can have mine for 1/3 price.it was very hard to pair.  As well.
0	Purchased 3 in retail pack.  The packaging has NO &#34;Plantronics&#34; name logo or part numbers.  This product may be chinese counterfeit.
2	MY HUSBAND HAD THE VOYAGER LEGEND BUT TWISTED IT THE WRONG WAY AND BROKE IT. I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE THE SOLUTION BUT HE SAYS ITS NOT NEARLY AS COMFORTABLE SO WE ARE GOING BACK TO THE LEGEND!
0	I spent the extra bucks to buy a Plantronics. Unfortunately I quit using the headset after my callers complained about the call quality.
2	It is good headphone. But after using it some days the ear covers are gone. I did not like that. Given another chance I will not buy it.
2	The Nokia BH-503 Stereo Headset (Black) is cumbersome and really not worth the purchase when there are other headset products with similar price points that also include FM radio.If you do decide to order the Nokia BH-503 Stereo Headset (Black)you need to consider purchasing extra ear pads.The headset isn't adjustable or comfortable.The only positive that can be submitted regarding this headset is that the music is clear and the phone calls are equally clear.
2	I use bluetooth headphones constantly while working or just around town. I do not like the huge over the ear type so I look for something behind the neck like these. I had a set that I liked for the last couple of years but they finally broke. I purchased these to replace that set which was a different brand from a local box store.The first thing I noticed about these was the weight. They weigh at least twice as much as my previous Bluetooth headphones. Putting them on I notice that the headphones just don't fit the angle of my ears like they should. It feels almost like they should be angled in on the bottom more. I get a pressure on the top of my ear lobe but it is not tight against the bottom of my ear lobe.The next thing I noticed was the sound quality it is not great but adequate. They definitely do not have a ton of range or depth to the music but they can get pretty loud.For the positive stuff... I like the button layout. Everything is easy to press and the volume rocker is nice and big. The battery life is great. I can easily get a couple days out of them before I need to recharge.Overall I am not blown away or even that happy with them. But I may keep them because the price is reasonable.
2	They are a bit heavy and I was concerned they would fall while I jogged. They do stay on my ears (barely). The best use would be if you were working at your desk or sedentary. I do not think they the best for an active person. The sound quality is ok. It doesn't have memory; once you disconnect or pause you have to adjust the sound to the previous level you set. The controls are tactile and easy to use/find. Pairing was simple and the blue light is not annoying.
2	I got these last week and I've tried them out on 2 different smartphones and 2 different computers. The sound quality for music is really good and I've been comfortable wearing them for multiple hours. Using them with many devices can be a bit of a pain because Bluetooth does not transition between devices very smoothly (takes a few extra steps - which result in missed calls and other inconveniences).I can walk around most of my small apartment and still hear the music. When I walk behind a wall it usually gets staticy and cuts out until I am back within sight of the device. It seems unfortunate that I can't use them in the whole house since apartment isn't much more than 900 sq ft.The major reason that I bought these was to do high quality voice calls over Bluetooth. This has been hit-or-miss. Many times (especially when listening to music when the call arrives) the voice quality will be terrible and I will need to call the person back. The quality also suffers a lot when I am sync'ing the phone over Bluetooth and trying to make a voice call at the same time. But even when not syncing and not listening to music just making a simple call and nothing else the call quality will be bad (I hear static and the other side hears me like you are in a tunnel - reported by 3 different people).It seems like the phones (N75 EVO) may not have proper noise canceling like Skype or other VOIP products. So far I've had fairly good success with these over VOIP. Callers have not complained and I have not heard the static that I get on cell calls.So in the end I'm happy to keep these and use them for listening to music and VOIP calling on my desktop. But I am unfortunately going to have to find another solution to use with my smartphone :(
2	This works great.Pros -You can watch movies from netflix youtube quicktime TV.com or any other movie player or video app from your iphone to your tv. You can even watch your images on the big screen when you look at them through a slideshow.Cons -It doesn't come with a power cord and it's not a standard USB plug. I'm still trying to figure out what type of plug I need for this. Until then I just make sure the iPhone is fully charged before plugging it into the TV.UPDATE: 2/25/12 - It still connects great to the iphone and we did find a cord to plug into it. The problem though is that the soldering on the power cord plug is weak and from just hanging it easily jiggled it loose. We can no longer charge our Iphones while watching videos from them. This means we need at least a little bit of a charge before watching shows :( This really lowered the effectiveness of this product and has changed my rating from 5 stars to 2.
0	Don't waste your money.  This will work but at what cost.  You pay $25 more than it is worth.  Unless you plan on watching the video on a screen smaller than 20 inches I would not buy this.
2	At first this cable did what it said.  It connects your iphone/ipad/ipod to a video or audio device through an AV connection.  (I.e. one yellow cable for video and a red and white cable for left and right audio).  It has a micro-usb power input so if you have a micro-usb cable you can power your device while it's running video or audio.Within a week I was no longer getting a reliable connection - I would have to wiggle the cable or carefully put things under the cable to raise it relative to the iphone or wouldn't get output.  A few weeks after that and I can't get a connection at all.  I don't know if it's a manufacturing issue a design issue or if the weight of the cable just degrades the connection after a while.  Maybe a dock would be a better choice.  If you buy this I would recommend saving the packaging in case you need a return.Another word of caution: under the standard Apple operating system not all applications support video out through the port at the bottom of the device.  For example Netflix currently supports video out for the iphone 4 and ipad but not for earlier iphones or for ipods.  So you can't take a factory spec device and expect to mirror the home screen or anything like that but you can play the stuff that the Apple operating system wants you to play.I have a jailbroken iphone 3g running tvout2 mirror a non istore app that mirrors all output to the cable.  Using that Netflix runs great on my 3g with this cable at least when the cable is working.  (Google for info on jailbreaking or tvout2 mirror but proceed at your own risk).
0	Well at first it did work like for the 1st try then it got bad didn't work at all I bought for nothing don't even buy it...:
0	We had ordered this for Our daughter for her phone. Looking at picture and according to description it had a hard case with rubber outer print. Needed something sturdy for our teenager. Useless because its plastic and the first time she drops it  it will break because she had one like the one we received and it had already broke  the first time it was bumped. Would by from seller again but will pay closer attention to desription and picture
0	The look is cool! But getting it on and off was not easy! So now it sits in a drawer collecting dust!
2	It was a very tight fit onto my phone and once it was on it was a struggle to get it off made me break multiple nails... kind of a hassle but if youre going to keep it on for awhile might as well get it
2	The new Nokia N96 phone reads like a powerhouse smartphone packed with features. It is a full color unlocked GSM slider phone with a 5MP camera stereo sound music and video features. While it is a quad band world phone here in the US it works on T-Moblie and AT&T; networks (although AT&T; is recommened for its faster 3G network). Let me start out by describing what you get. Nokia has packed quite a bit in the box. They include cables to hook your phone up to you TV to watch video a car charger a sync cable to sync your phone to your pc for updates video app and music downloads battery travel charger a remote that hooks into the phone along with earbuds that hook into the remote (no you can't use the earbuds without the remote and you cannot hook alternate headsets into the phone or the remote)an invitation to use the OVI service (an online backup service with tiered features to backup your phone) a User Guide Get Started Guide the Nokia PC Suite CD an NGage free game offer warranty info and of course the phone.Now for the phone. It is a beautiful full color lightweight device that promises much but delivers less. Since this is a GSM phone after calling to switch service you only need to add your SIM card to start using it. The battery was partially charged out of the box so it did not take long to charge. Despite what I have read from other reviews I had no problems adding contacts from my SIM card to the phone. Since this phone IS NOT a touch screen everything is menu driven. Nokia did not do a good job of letting you know where all the menus are. While a User Guide is included the full version of how to use the phone is included in the online version of the guide that can be found at the Nokia product page. The buttons on this phone do not stand out as much as I would like. The call and end keys are on opposite sides but are not as prominent as they should be. The Power key is on top and it takes a few minutes to turn it on. There are media keys that work for video or music playback that surround the larger scroll key. The scroll key is used to navigate the various menus with the usual Nokia context sensitive Selection keys above the Call and End keys. The scroll key is very sensitive I kept hitting selections that I did not want and it is also used for navigating web pages. There is a menu key that is usefull and a multimedia key which isn't that helpful. The display is beautiful and call quality is excellent. You slide the main section up to bring up the keyboard and number pad. This phone should have had a qwerty keyboard as the typing on the keypad is time consuming pressing keys until you come to the one yo need.  This is also even more frustrating for the Internet. While the display is very clear the browser is only a WAP mobile browser not the full Internet browser that an iPhone or iPod Touch would have. Using the scroll key to move a too small arrow around is a pain. While this phone offers YouTube the Internet video quality is very spotty. The stereo sound in 3D is very clear and you do not need a headset to listen. This phone is one of the few compatible with the Amazon UnBox service. To try out the service I installed the Nokia PC suite. It installled a software updater Video suite manager photo app PC suite app and a Map loader for the GPS function. The installation of the apps was fast though starting the PC Suite app took a very long time. The Amazon UnBox service is a video on demand portable player to watch video on you PC or mobile device. It was very easy to download the player and install it. Amazon has a nice selection of videos and I downloaded a Stargate SG-1 episode to view on my phone. Purchasing was fast and easy although downloading took a very long time because of the extra option for portable files. The UnBox player interface is nice but I had a difficult time trying to transfer the files to the phone. The help files say that you can just copy files to the phone but you actually transfer the files by clicking play. After finally getting the files to transfer to the phone I was able to watch the video. The video playback on the phone for the Amazon purchase was clear and of excellent quality. Playback on the phone is in the widescreen format. It will play in both portrait and landscape mode although queing up takes a while unlike an iPod or iPhone. You can slide the main phone the other way to show the video keys in landscape mode. The main 5MP camera with the Carl Zeiss lens is outstanding the best camera I have seen on a phone so far. It has a flash and is located on the back. There is also a lower resolution camera on the front. Both can capture images and video. Photos look fantastic. The N96 is also supposed to broadcast TV signals through the LIVE TV service but like most of the Nokia service options it is not available in the US. Neither is the Nokia Music Store and the Nokia Maps turn by turn service. The phone will play music via the Windows Media Player (no Apple iTunes formats) and podcasts. It also has an FM radio and Internet radio playback capability. The radio feature will only play with the remote and headset attached. You cannot listen to the radio without the attachments another boneheaded manuever by Nokia. The Maps feature which is the GPS function to me was useless. After the app opens you see a 3D image of the planet. You have to install the Maps software before the actual street level option will work and as I mentioned before the turn by turn doesn't work in the US. My iPod Touch handles GPS faster and easier than this. The N96 is also supposed to be Bluetooth compatible but I could not get it to discover my Bluetooth headset despite numerous attempts.This phone has a lot of quirks. While it does turn on fairly quickly and you can make calls quickly Using many of the features means responding to a number of silly requests such as go on Internet now? after selecting the web option. I personally prefer touch screen phones because it is much easier to navigate than having to drill down through numerous menus. Some shortcut options are available but not for a lot of features. I did not try the OVI service since I already use a wonderful service called Dashwire to backup my phone. The N96 does have a large 16 GB storage with a memory card addition available it does leave a lot to be desired. This phone is better engineered for the overseas market rather than the US. It would a good option for those who use the Windows Media audio files for music and radio and camera and video fans. It is a good effort but falls short especially for the high price.
2	SummaryThe Nokia N96 is an expensive phone that competes against many rival companies that have done their homework over the years to provide competitive products against this phone-dominating firm. The N96 fails to be able to be a leader in its phone class with issues that are problematic of a phone years older.  The few positives of the N96 do not command the high purchase price.Background:I used the N96 with AT&T; service in the US.  My local areas has extensive 3G coverage so I was always able to get a solid 3G fast connection (Note I do not have any LiveTV service in my area).  My normal phones I use are the Iphone 3G and the Samsung Blackjack II (windows mobile).  I am a rather geeky person who enjoys tinkering with phones and computers so I will provide an assessment from a user-experience in comparison to the two phones I've cited which I use often on the same 3G service; for those who aren't aware GSM phones have sim cards that can be popped into different phones so aren't tied to a specific piece of hardware (i.e. Verizon Sprint).Unboxing:The N96 comes in a very nice retail box.  This is typical of Nokia's products placing a high degree of emphasis on packaging.  It sets off a nice first impression of the product.Build:Overall the phone has a mirrored surface for its LCD and a shiny black glossy surface for the rest of the phone.  The black does attract fingerprints and at first this tends to put people off.  However after a while the fingerprint effect psychologically diminishes upon itself so you do not really care.The keys are only average in tactile feel and comparable to a regular $200 phone.  This is surprising since I thought a top of the line phone would have quality keys with a firm solid response.  Not so here.  The keys spacing are not conducive to one-hand dialing without looking at the unit.The LCD is beautiful with crisp text and accurate color display. If there's anything that's very well engineered on this phone it will be the LCD and camera (more on that below).  Truly world-class I haven't quite seen an LCD look as good as on this phone.The camera is really good on this phone. Quite a far cry from the iphone and other Windows mobile phones.  Pictures come out reasonably sharp in daylight.  Low light is poor but again that's nothing unusual from any camera phone and the quality is still leaps and bounds better than the iphone. The camera does have a very bright LED that can amazingly light up a dead-dark environment a few feet ahead at max range.The exterior speaker is loud enough but only average in quality with a slightly tinny output.  I believe that my blackjack II's speaker is louder and cleaner in output not significantly so but enough to be noticeable.The rear kickstand a widely marketed feature is a pure gimmick that is poorly designed. Because it is not directly in the middle of the unit the weight is not properly balanced. This means that an uneven surface or a slight breeze could topple the unit over.  Tacky I was so full of disgust when I tried it myself.  Needs to be completely reengineered or gotten rid of entirely.The ports are that of a micro USB headphone and power port. Nokia has decided not to use the USB port for power however so you have to lug around the power plug during travel if you take your laptop with you.  Not cool!There are no rubber boots for the ports on the phone.  Not a good sign - -water seepage can end up being a problem here.  And for those who say those boots tear off anyway that is not necessarily true.  My old Blackjack II phone never had any of its boots torn off even though I heavily abused it for a year by inserting an removing countless times.Battery life is mediocre.  I could get about a day's worth of use with heavy web browsing and a few phone calls.  The battery gets much hotter than a normal smartphone does when in heavy discharge/charge mode.  It would be nice if Nokia could address this issue by producing a phone that doesn't feel like a mini hot plate to your face or hand.Accessories:The included car charger is a strange size.  It could not fit into my cig lighter.  Fortunately I had a car charger from a different Nokia model that was compatible.  There is a proper USB cable included which is a good thing since not everyone has a microUSB ported type of cable.  The travel charger is small enough.  There is no MicroSD card included but these are cheap enough to buy for anyone who needs more than the regular 16GB of built in memory.  It's really nice that the memory is expandable like this compared to the iphone where you are locked out from expansion options.  For music lovers this means you can have a max of 24GB of memory and 16GB microsd's are on there way over soon so that would mean 32gb of storage.  Not bad!Interface and response:The user interface is typical Nokia sybian.  That is the menu set is fairly straight forward in operation.  The phone however has a sluggish feel to it.  Programs load sluggishly making you wonder if you pressed the right button to launch it.  After a bit the lag finally catches up.  I expect such typical behavior from a Windows Mobile phonebut the fact a Symbian phone does this is clearly unacceptable.  I'm not sure why the phone is so slow in execution; supposedly this phone lacks a multimedia processor and is clocked very low.  Regardless it simply is slow and that's all that matters to the end-user who will feel upset waiting at the response times.  This issue likely extends into the browser.The built-in web browser is much better than IE for windows mobile.  However it is much worse than the Iphone's browser.  Pages render fairly well but loading is slow and scrolling stutters.  Although the phone was capable of launching youtube videos from the regular youtube site there was so much stuttering going on that it was useless. Resource intensive sites like CNN are too slow to load making it painful to view.  Zooming was horrible and nonintuitive. Again this was a common issue on old phones from the early 2000s but a top of the line phone for 2009?  The Iphone by comparison breezes through the most intense sites with ease.  This is sadly not a good web browsing phone. Since a 3G data plan with AT&T; is so expensive some of us would like a phone that's capable of browsing like an Iphone does.  Can't do that here.The phone does not support an international character set out of the box.  If you want to to view Chinese for example you cannot do this unless you mail in your phone to a Nokia service center.  This is a ludicrous option (did we timewarp to 1999?) in a time when extras should be downloadable from the manufacturer even for a fee.  Since there's only one Nokia service center in the entire USA you have to wait a long time for the turnaround.  To go without a phone that long is unacceptable.  The Iphone by comparison supports International characters right out of the box!The java stack on the N96 is awful.  It's too sensitive to security prohibitions and runs sluggishly again.  I tried running Opera Mini a java app and it kept giving me security warnings every time I launched it with no way to bypass those warnings.  The Opera mini program ran much slower than on my Blackjack II a reflection again on the slow processing speed of the N96.The included GPS program was incredibly slow (do I hear an echo?) compared to the free Google Maps I've used on the iphone and the Blackjack.  Scrolling just to browse a map was painful and not something I could have any fun with.  In contrast I love being able to just browse the maps on my other phones because it's quick and efficient.The N96 does have an auto position that uses the accelerometer.  It does work (disabled by default) but not all Symbian programs support it.  Therefore you are left with a rather quirky feature that may not activate when you expect it to.The T9 system is fast and pretty accurate. Honestly it's not going to get any better than this for input with a numeric keypad. The next step is have some hard alpha keys or an onscreen keyboard.As for phone quality it sounded pretty good on both ends. Then again a 3G connection provides the crisp quality so the network infrastructure is more to the reason here.Conclusion:Nokia's N96 feels like a step back into time. It is sluggish in response has poor included utilities and its construction is not as good compared to its main rivals -- The iphone and the various Windows mobile platform phones.  The high price is not commensurate with its ability.  In particular web browsing is awful.  A complete redesign is needed to make this phone faster and more intuitive.
2	I was extremely excited to open up the Nokia N96 because from its specs it looked to be one of the most powerful mobile phones on the market.  It certainly lived up to its expectations in some areas and exceeds them in others but fell short with some very common issues.For anyone looking for a camera/media device that also does phone calls this might have been a serious contender.The media player works well for audio the built-in FM tuner is great and the internet radio feed was easy to use and loaded with content.  This phone does everything well but not nearly well enough to justify its astronomical price tag.------------------Things Done Right:Browser - The browser on the phone rendered the pages I tried perfectly and it was very easy to navigate using the device.  Bookmarks and other features you'd want were all there.FM Radio - This worked like a charm!  It was very cool to have this in a mobile device.Light Weight - The phone weighs considerably less than my AT&T; Fuze and Tilt.Massive Storage - The phone's best feature is its internal 16 GB of storage.Looks - Trust me when I say the phone looks even better in person.---------------Half-Way There:Mapping - Rather than relying on a live internet feed for maps it had very detailed maps of the US right on the phone.  This is great if you are in an area with patchy service and need directions.  But it's no Google Maps.  I've been spoiled by having Google Maps on my Windows Mobile phones for some time now and while the mapping application on this phone is good it's not Google Maps.  Plus many of the advanced features of this application require an extra fee such as turn-by-turn directions and traffic reports.WiFi - Connecting the phone to my home wireless network with WPA/PSK was a breeze.  HOWEVER many of the features  on the phone such as the mapping tool internet radio and others required use of data plan even if you were connected via WiFi.  And despite trying I could never get it to connect to my computer for WiFi Sharing.Help - The phone has online help for nearly every menu most of which was well-written and useful.  Some of the more rare settings had no help however.Camera - While this phone won't replace your $200 digital camera it's better than what I've seen on most mobile phones.  I especially liked the on-screen menus for making adjustments on the fly.  The flash on the back of the camera is great for close-up subjects.Voice Command - There is a utility which reads you your messages to you which was pretty neat.  And you can dial your contacts through voice command plus launch applications.  Unfortunately that's all.  Voice command apps on other devices allow you to dial numbers as they are spoken play specific media or dictate text messages.-----------------More Work Needed:No Keyboard - This device lacks both a keyboard and touch screen limiting all input to the numeric pad and a plethora of other buttons.  If you are a heavy text/emailer this is going to be a deal-breaker for you.IM Difficult - The phone includes an IM application but it was intimidating to configure with settings that I had no clue about.  Other phones include apps which are preconfigured for Yahoo AIM and MSN but that was not the case here.  The manual and help were useless here.Micro USB - Every portable device I own uses Mini USB for sync and charging but the Nokia N96 introduces the even smaller Micro USB.  That means that I need to carry yet another cable.No USB Charge - To make it worse you cannot charge via USB.  While the phone comes with an AC charger and a car charger its proprietary and means yet ANOTHER cable to carry.WMV Playback - Despite being touted as a media player the phone would not play any of the WMV files I copied to it.  These were non-DRM files that worked fine on other phones.AGPS - The manual claims that the phone supports Assisted GPS (to speed up your positioning) but it would not work.Other Annoyances - There were a few other things that bothered me about the phone.  For instance the music playback stuttered while using the phone for text messaging or mapping and there was no option to disable the power-saving features while on AC power.--------------In Conclusion:For the price that this phone sells for and comparing it to other devices on the market at half the price I find it very hard to justify recommending the phone to anyone.Its only real saving grace is the 16 GB of storage although some of its competitors will support memory cards with 4-16 GB of capacity.If the price came down considerably and they issued a software upgrade to fix several of the above issues it would probably beat its competitors hands-down.  But until then I recommend passing this phone up for any of its half-priced competitors.
2	I return the item because it did not give me all it says will do.
2	I was excited to try this phone out as I have been using Windows Mobile devices for awhile (currently using the AT&T; Tilt) and never been completely satisfied with their performance. A 16 gig phone geared for music and video looked right up my alley. Having used this phone for several days and tried as many features as possible I'm not nearly as enamored with it as I hoped. For a $600 phone I expected something far more polished. This seems to have been rushed into production and has quite a few bugs and problems. Let's run down the good stuff first.PROS:- Light compact form factor. Considerably lighter than my Tilt.- 16 gig of memory. Excellent amount of included space and can take a microSD card for even more media files.- Beautiful screen. Video is sharp and colorful although it could be a bit brighter. But hard to complain with the quality of the picture. See below though for more comments on video playback. It also is much more visible in sunlight than my Tilt is.- 5 gig camera with flash and video capability. I debated whether to include this under the pros as I didn't find the quality of the images produced by the camera all that great particularly indoors. But having a flash and being able to record video with it is still at least better than not having it at all.- Excellent sound quality and nice loud speakers. Includes two speakers for sort-of stereo playback. This phone can really produce some serious volume I was quite impressed. Granted the sound quality out of the speakers is not going to blow anyone away. But it's pretty good regardless. And make sure you turn the volume down before using the headphones it will totally blast you away! If you regularly try to listen to music in noisy situations where volume is crucial you will know how important this can be.- Excellent multimedia features included. FM radio internet radio podcasts etc. Most of these I could do on my WM phone but great to have them included for seamless integration right on the phone.- Good included accessories. Includes a remote with speakerphone car charger TV out cables free game etc. Better package overall than most phones.Now for my fairly long list of negatives.CONS:- Lack of fullsize keyboard and/or touchscreen. I was surprised to see there was no touchscreen on this phone that makes it really hard to compete with other smartphones in the same class like the iPhone and any Windows Mobile phone. With my Tilt I not only have a full QWERTY keyboard (which granted is not the greatest way to enter text for most people but nice for things like passwords and WEP keys) you can use a wide variety of entry methods that work with the touchscreen. I personally use ones like Fitaly and Touchpad which can give good speed and yet still easily handle non-standard text at any time. One of the things I particularly find annoying with phones like this that use T9 is that you often have to turn it on and off which requires going to the menu. Likewise with the multi-key entry of letters and numbers you have to constantly switch back and forth which takes far longer on this phone than just about any other smartphone I've used. It's incredibly tedious and if you use your phone as a PDA or anything other than quick texting you should probably look at better options.- Problems using Wifi versus AT&T; data plans. I personally use pay-as-you-go currently as I don't need to pay for monthly cell phone service and almost always have access to Wifi networks. With my Tilt it's a simple matter of a one-time configuration of the phone for any Wifi network and it will use that automatically versus accessing the AT&T; data network. This phone just would not cooperate with that. It often would switch over and use the data plan and charge me no matter how I configured it even going into the settings and making my Wifi the default. Worse you would have to do this *every* time you access a new Wifi network setting it up as a default and then switching it back and even then it seems to randomly hit the data network and charge me for usage without warning. And to make it even more annoying just about every time it needs to access the internet it has to ask me what network to use the Wifi or AT&T.; Why bother setting a default (and configuring it for automatic) if it's not going to just use it?? It's almost like the phone is trying to get you to use the paid data plan whether you have access to Wifi or not. Just about everything else on this phone I can kind of deal with or work around but this is so frustrating for me and COSTS ME MONEY that it's a total dealbreaker. So if you want to use Wifi as your primary data access network and not pay the significant cost of a monthly data plan you will probably want to use a different phone.- Bare-bones email and web applications. The email and web apps that came with the phone didn't do much for me. Emails with HTML were not properly formatted at all and the options for handling email as well were very limited compared to what I am used to. When I tried to adjust my settings it wiped out my custom POP settings and I had to enter them all over again (which due to the lack of keyboard is particularly annoying). The web browser was not quite as bad but navigating the pages without a touchscreen is slow and tedious and it kept popping up the overall page view when it was inconvenient. The back button brings up little thumbnails of the pages but for some reason they were often blank and kept skipping the actual page I wanted to get back to. I was easily able to load on the free Opera Mini browser however which gave me a far better experience. If you use a smartphone I highly recommend grabbing a copy of it. I've not yet found a free email replacement I'd probably have to pay to get an email application that just does the basics that I would have liked to come with the device.- While there's certainly plenty of games on Symbian and for N-Gage the library of applications is a bit more limited. Also just the fact that it doesn't use a touchscreen makes game play often more limiting and somewhat more tedious as it relies totally on keystrokes particularly the types of games I prefer (card games adventure games etc.) Still the games offered were decent enough and the graphics top-notch for a mobile phone and I do notice more places offering Symbian versions of their software. Both my Hava player and Roboform mobile apps had versions that ran okay on the N96 (although not flawless).- Performance issues. My main hope was that this device would be zippier and less prone to locking up than the Tilt. Unfortunately this was not the case. The processor is downgraded from the previous N95 model most likely done to allow them to also downgrade the battery as well but I can't say if the problems I saw are a result of this or typical for Symbian phones. While the video was sharp and beautiful to look at I still experienced pauses and skips...particularly with the sample videos included! Almost all of the ones included with the phone did not play smoothly all the way through. I had better luck with some small videos that I synced to the device and a couple TV episodes that I downloaded from Amazon Unbox. While they did not always play perfectly they were at least watchable for 95% of the time. The phone itself also often temporarily pauses and/or freezes and a few times locked up on me completely. Unlike the Tilt which has a reset option I could not figure out how to unlock this phone when it froze other than to remove the back and pull the battery out. Very annoying.- Camera image quality. It's important when evaluating cameras to realize that megapixels means little about quality. So getting 5 MP with the phone means mostly that the images it takes will just take up more space on the phone. They certainly aren't of a quality that I would be interested in printing them out which is where the 5 MP would be of any use. They are of similar quality to most cellphones...which means only good for snapshots when you have nothing better on-hand. And indoors in anything other than very bright light they were definitely worse than what my Tilt is able to take even though the camera includes a flash.- Battery life. Barely passable no better than my Tilt which was equally a battery hog. You definitely need to charge it every night and if you use your phone much you may find you need to charge it during the day as well.- Voice control. This is one of those phones that you don't really train it just recognizes the names you speak and picks the default phone. Also some basic application control. This type of VR can be problematic if you have people with similar names and I just much prefer training my own names and commands as I can with the software on WM phones. And of course there's nothing in the manual about how to even use this feature.- Live TV. Touted as a feature but won't work for most people due to very limited coverage right now. You're probably much better off just getting a Slingbox or Hava which will work with a wide range of phones these days including this one.- Non-standard USB cable. May seem like a small nit but things like this just annoy me. Why not use a standard mini-USB cable which most people have multiple ones of and also a USB cable that will simultaneous charge the device? It's really annoying when you are syncing the device moving videos etc. and it runs out of juice. Using this new micro USB cable means I'll need to buy another one for travel....and probably another cable for charging in different places.- GPS. I only tested the GPS briefly as this was another area where it seemed to insist on using the data plan rather than Wifi. But I just don't see the benefit in using a GPS on such a small screen and paying monthly fees for it when you can buy dedicated GPS units for as little as $100 these days that are larger and easier to read while driving and with much better features. This GPS didn't work nearly as well as my simple Garmin unit and didn't even compare with running TomTom on my Tilt which I don't pay any fee to use (other than the purchase cost of the software).- No case or screen protector. For the price some kind of cheap case would be nice. The device comes with a plastic skin covering the front and back that would do nicely as a screen protector but for some reason they plastered a big NOKIA over the front so it can't be used. The screen and phone itself really shows fingerprints and smudges pretty readily so a screen protector would have been highly appreciated.- Nokia PC Suite issues. I didn't have too much trouble syncing my Outlook contacts but had various issues with other parts of the PC Suite. Forget using the music application for some reason it didn't read 99% of the tags in my MP3s so had to use Media Player to sync music to the device. The video manager as well did not work very well for me. It handled small videos okay but as soon as it got to anything with length it locked up on me. Took me several tries to convert videos of more than 100 meg in size. I want to try and do some conversions myself and see what videos it really can handle as I have other mobile video conversion software that does a good job but I know already it doesn't seem to handle Divx video which is a shame.- Bare bones user manual. The manuals included cover the basics but you won't find much help in them if you need more than just getting started information. For instance I was trying to figure out where I turn on T9 predictive text but there's absolutely no information in the manual on text entry whatsoever. I went to the Nokia site to see if the support section had a better manual to download but nope. You better be good at figuring stuff out on your own to use this phone (and yes I did figure out where the T9 setting was).- Other issues. I seem to just run into random problems with this phone. YouTube videos for instance would not play at all regardless of which browser I used. It doesn't seem to like most of my album art in the music player and does not always play smoothly if playing in the background while doing other activities on the phone (web browsing for instance). The microSD slot is harder than most to get the card in and out of. The build quality is very plastic cheap feeling. And there are just some things that make it obvious it was kind of rushed to market. For instance there's a settings screen for a scroll wheel even though the phone doesn't even have one! Would be nice if it did but to have settings in there for something that does not even exist on it makes me wonder how much testing they really gave this phone before releasing.To summarize this is a phone I really wanted to like. It's got huge potential as a portable media device and phone but there are just too many problem areas to recommend it over other devices in the same price range.
2	I anxiously awaited the arrival of this Nokia N96.  Its included features are enough to make anyone drool.I am using the device with AT&T; Wireless in the United States.  I quickly found that your basic phone functions are more or less easy to use.  Slide down the bottom keypad and you're ready to dial a number.However the other features I was so excited to try on the device were somewhat less easy to use.  The small indented power button on top of the device is even a bit confusing.  You have to depress it for a fair amount of time.  This can be a bit of a challenge with large fingers.The web browser is quite quick and the silver navigation ring on the front of the phone made it relatively easy to move around webpages.  However somewhat less easy was figuring out how to connect it to the Internet.  I added my home wifi network which wasn't too difficult but I imagine would be a challenge for some users.  However now whenever I try to use any Internet based application or service I have to select what connection I want: my home wifi the mobile carrier's data network etc.  It doesn't just connect you have to confirm and select information every-time you go to do something  Want to listen to Internet radio get ready to confirm you want to do that and that you want to connect to the Internet and what connection you want to use. Want to use Nokia Maps?  Get ready to select your Internet connection.  It's really troubling.The phone is also setup by default in metric measurements.  I changed a setting from metric to imperial but my maps still calculate everything based on kilometers rather than miles.  This does not bother me for the fact I'm very comfortable with metric measurements but I imagine others might find this confusing and frustrating. Surely there is setting to change this but it is not obvious.Turn by Turn Directions is a bright spot for the Nokia N96.  Nokia will give you a 3 month trial of Turn by Turn Directions.  Then all you need is a connection to the Internet with your mobile provider and you can get turn by turn directions from your current location to a destination of your choice.  You can also search for businesses restaraunts or anything else you might be interested in driving to.  Walking directions are also available.  I would give the maps and turn by turn implementation on this phone a 4/5.  It works quite nicely once you get it running though it is still a bit cumbersome.The camera included with the N96 is another bright spot. For a mobile phone camera it's one of the best.  It is 5 megapixels but more importantly it has a good camera lens that take solid pictures under good lighting.  It has an autofocus as well.  Perhaps even more impressive the video you can shoot with the Nokia N96 is the best quality setting is also very good.  The video recording capability is one of the things I plan to use the N96 for the most.Connect the N96 to your computer for some exciting options.  On a Windows computer you can use the Amazon Unbox service to sync the mobile copies of your purchased TV shows.  This can be good if you need to watch a show on the go.  It's also easy to use popular music applications (except iTunes obviously) and included software to sync your MP3 files to your phone such as the ones you can purchase from the Amazon MP3 store.  Videos from Amazon Unbox look quite good when viewed on the N96 and the sound from the Internal speaker and headphones were both impressive.I also tried connecting the N96 to my Mac.  Surprisingly selecting the mass media option from the handset after connecting it via USB even my Mac could sync with iPhoto the photos and videos I recorded on the phone!  That is fantastic.  Mac users can still use the N96 to pull the photos and videos they take.  A nice feature.3G - The N96 can connect to AT&T; 3G network where available.  This does allow faster map searching and internet browsing though drains the battery somewhat quicker.FM Radio - A surprising feature of the Nokia N96 is that when you connect standard headphones you can listen to your local FM radio.  It may sound like something of the past but when your device has the capability it is more convenient than you might think.Drawbacks - Again a big drawback of the N96 is that it is not always easy to use.  You'll spend several minutes if not longer the first time you try to do anything.  Furthermore without a dedicated QWERTY pad typing messages emails or web addresses can be a challenge.Overall the Nokia N96 brings together a tremendous number of features.  You have a solid phone camera solid video recorder multimedia player music player FM radio calendar web browser 16 GB of included memory and more.  However there is a high learning factor to use many of the features.  Furthermore with the power and capability of the phone you sometimes find yourself wishing for a QWERTY keyboard or a touch screen.The N96 has some amazing capabilities but for the several hundred dollars the device requires to purchase I am left wondering how many people should pay that much money for it.  If you really believe it's the perfect phone for you I would not discourage you.  However if you are not completely against getting a contract phone an offering from Blackberry or the iPhone may be a simpler to use solution.
2	Here in starts my multiple day review of the Nokia N96.Background: I am an IT person and like to be at the bleeding edge ofgadgetry... I currently use a Blackberry Bold 9000 and an iPhone 3g 16gb. Iwill soon be getting a google g1 and a blackberry 8900.I am no stranger to mobile technology and 3g networks....Day One is Today: 1/11/2009I charged the battery overnight and inserted an AT&T; sim card to get itrunning. The N96 walked me through a quick setup wizard for the usual dateand time etc... We were up and running in less then 5 minutes. GREAT!...nocomplaints there.I went ahead on an exploratory mission. Having used Nokias in the past thiswas easy for me. I set up my wireless network at home which is usually atabout 80% signal in most of our home. Setup was easy and I was online withthe N96.I started to do the obvious - I kept navigating through the icons to seewhat features were available what ringtones were included sample videosetc. So far so good....I thought the speakers on the phone were a bit out ofshape...but I didnt expect home theater sound either....I setup my POP3 email account again very easy and began to test emailmessaging etc.... This is where my woes began. Every few minutes the phonewould ask me if I wanted to use AT&T; medianet to connect since it had lostinternet connection to the wireless network. This kept happening....forabout 30 minutes...until I finally gave up. I went and checked my router etcand there were no internet issues. I rebooted the router just in case andstarted to test the phone again about 15 minutes later. Again...it would geton our WIFI and keep dropping it every few minutes...this time I was about25 feet away from my router.Day 1 is over - Day 2 is tomorrow and I will update the reivew then. Pleasedo NOT Vote for me until you have read my entire review for this phone...I am disappointed thus-far.Day 2 01/12/09One note of caution before I begin day 2 of testing. This is a dual sliderphone....from the bottom up you get the keypad for numeric dialing...fromthe top down you get media controls play/pause etc. I find that the balanceof the phone is thrown off when revealing the keypad and thus dialing is abit difficult on the go....I am a cross platform computer user but prefer to use a mac for most digitalmedia related solutions. Today I will attempt to get the N96 connected tothe mac and do some downloads. I will also be attaching the phone to mywireless network in the office to see if the problems from yesterdayre-appear. (i will update the review as I see fit during the day).I have downloaded the iSync plugin and the Multimedia transfer software from[...] So far so good...easy to install and get going.The N96 seemlesly integrates with the mac in that iPhoto launches showingthe device and images that are on it. It also allows for synchronizing allphotos onto the device....I like this so far. The Nokia Multimedia Transfersuite allows transfer of iTunes music to the device...and now that iTunes isDRM free this will be a nice feature considering the N96's 16gb of memory.The iSync plugin allows you to launch iSync on the mac and add the N96 as adevice...very easy. I can now sync all of my contacts and calendars from mymac to the N96. I dont think too much detail is required on the above twotopics...they are very easy and work well.You must remember to download the software from [...] asit is NOT included on the CD's in the box. The phone can then be connectedvia micro usb and or bluetooth. (Did I mention my gripe due to the fact thatthey chose micro usb instead of mini usb...now we need all new chargers...)My opinion of the phone seems to be improving a bit due to the connectivitybut the wireless lan still remains as a challenge...I have had to turn ofthe WLAN so that I can test and review the phone.Now on to some other features: (brief one liners)FM Radio - Excellent Feature and very clear reception in and around New YorkCity.Camera - Great 5mp Resolution and can be used as a pocket camera whencarrying a 2nd camera is not feasible. However it should be noted that evenin bright daylight the images show some noise..Allows for music and podcasts which I love. I am a podcast listener due tolong 3-4 hour commutes.(NOTE that the Nokia Software must be running at all times when phone isconnected via usb or bluetooth)Great applications out of the box not to mention the very refined SymbianOS which allows for great flexibility.Capacity at 16gb is amazing and allows for all of your media to be stored onthe phone.Application/Game downloads from the phone are easy...when the WLAN works.Now for the final portion of my review - Amazon Video on Demand.First things first...you have to use the Amazon Unbox player which is onlyPC compatible for the time being. The VOD service is awesome and the pricesare great. I have seen friends using this in the past but have not tried itmyself until now. The download of unbox was very quick and installation wasperfect. I was able to install the player on Vista 32 Ultimate login to myamazon account and download my rented copy of Hancock to watch on my newN96... My first experience with this type of service (other then itunes) hasbeen great. I have always used AMAZON For mp3's but never for Video....I ama blu-ray type and thus enjoy my home theater experience...however I nowhave an alternative to getting movies for viewing while travelling etc....Conclusion:I feel that this phone has a lot more to offer then what I am seeing as aresult of two days of usage. The overall feature set is nice but it isfrustrating to use at best. Considering the $600+ price tag I am sure thatthere are other smart phones out there that can do what the N96 does andmuch more. The iPhone 3g is a perfect example.The 3g service while in its infancy in the US is definitely working wellon the N96. The iPhone 3g and Blackberry Bold will drop out on occasionwhere as the N96 is still showing coverage. I think this is because Nokiahas years of experience running on 3g networks and this phone shows it.I apologize for the long review but I felt that an item like this was worthyof a detailed test run...not a quick and dirty review.Pros:CapacityFootprintStyleMedia Syncing AbilitiesCamera (5mp - a bit noisy)Cons:Bad WLAN UsageBad balance while using keypad.Over priced.Controlling the phone is somewhat difficult.Box Includes:Phone.Battery.Chargers for both AC and Car.Headset for use alone or with adapter that has media controls.A/V Cable to attach to TV etc.USB to Micro USB Cable for Computer hookup.Documentation and software for Windows.Overall I would say this device is worthy of a great review...but I left itat 4 out of 5 because of the unsatisfactory wlan performance. I love thefact that the software Nokia provides makes it very easy to synchronizemedia and contact/calendar data from both a mac and a pc. The price tag is abit on the steep side.It is very hard to review a product with so much power in a short period oftime thus I am sure I will be updating this review as time goes on. I amhopeful that a firmware upgrade of sorts will fix potential issues on thisdevice and that the future will be bright.Features I still need to test include GPS and Applications.....updates will be forthcoming.
2	This phone aims to be an upgrade to theN95 8 GB but it falls a bit short of that.  The feature set is only very minimally upgraded (mainly more included memory plus a SD slot a pullout kickstand around the camera lens and a newer software release) and instead it introduces some new shortcomings.The first thing that struck me was how much of an underperformer this phone really is.  Using the included music player to stream audio to myPioneer Car Stereoover Bluetooth (A2DP) it would stutter every 11-12 seconds making for a less-than-stellar playback experience.  I attributed that to its slow processor though it is possible that a future firmware upgrade would fix this issue.  Either way i ended up returning it after a few days' use in favor of the slightly newerNokia N85 which in contrast performs much better and feels snappier overall.  (And by the way looks much more modern and sexy thanks in part to its gorgeous AMOLED screen).Secondly a couple of other shortcomings from the original N95 (interational version N95-1) are reintroduced in the N96.  Both use a 950mAh battery compared to 1200mAh in the subsequent N95 models as well as the N85 and coupled with its larger 2.8 LCD screen it means that it must be charged daily with any extended use.  Also although it does include 128 MB of RAM (runtime memory) only about 45MB or so are available for applications at startup so like the N95-1 it is subject to frequent out of memory errors if you leave a few applications open.Thirdly although Nokia have resolved their long-standing WCDMA patent dispute with Qualcomm this phone still only supports North American UMTS bands (850/1900 MHz) whereas the newer N85 has tri-band UMTS (850/1900/2100 MHz) and so will be able to get 3G speeds worldwide.  (Conversely the international version of the N96 will not get 3G speeds in North America).  In particular if you plan to travel to Japan or South Korea this phone will not work at all wheras the N85 will.  (All these phones support quad-band GSM though and will work on 2G speeds everywhere else in the world).The distinctive new feature of the N96 is its support for the DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcast for HandHelds) standard; however this feature is not enabled in the U.S. version since carriers here have chosen to use MediaFLO instead.  The price however remains as high as the international version (actually higher for most since they would get a carrier subsidy in most countries) so you end up paying a premium for a feature you cannot use.On the positive side this phone has much better support for different video formats/resolutions than other phones (also N-Series ones); it will pretty much play any movie you throw onto it without the need for transcoding or resizing.Also it built relatively solid (mine did not have any creaking sounds wobbly slider or the like) and if you are concerned about build quality you should definitely choose this over the N85.  Or you could choose to wait for the recently-announced N86 8MP (which upgrades the N85 with a 8MP camera 8MB of built-in memory in addition to a SD slot and more attention to build quality).One note worth mentioning about N-Series and other unlocked phones in general is that although you pay a higher price upfront when compared to other smartphones that are subsidized by the carrier (mainly AT&T;) you end up earning that back over time -- at least if you include a data plan.  The reason is that AT&T; charges higher prices for their smartphone/PDA/iPhone etc. plans than for the standard data unlimited plans.  For instance the data portion of the iPhone plan is $30/month wheras data unlimited for Symbian S60 phones like the N96/N95/N85 is $10 or $15 per month (depending on whether you also have unlimited messaging).  Over the 2-year contract period for the subsidized phone that's a $360 or $480 difference - more than enough to offset the initial price difference.  (So basically compared to the iPhone you get a lot more capabilities at a lower price).Secondly unlocked means that you are free to insert a SIM card from any GSM carrier in the world not just those from a given carrier.  If you travel abroad for instance you can go into a local store to get a prepaid card with local tariffs whereas with the iPhone you are forced to pay AT&T;'s international roaming charges ($1 - $3 per minute depending on country).Finally regarding carrier compatability: This phone is optimized for use on AT&T;'s network with support for the 850/1900 MHz 3G bands.  It will also work with T-Mobile USA albeit at 2G (GSM/EDGE) speeds.  It will NOT work with CDMA carriers such as Verizon Sprint Alltel US Cellular MetroPCS and so on.  For those carriers there is no such thing as an unlocked phone.
2	Shipping:Ordered this case on a Monday from Boxwave. Was not shipped out until Friday.  And that's after I had to email Boxwave customer service on Thursday to see what the hold up was.  It was shipped in small white envelope.  How long does it take to put it in an envelope and mail it?  Apparently 5 days!  It's so hard having a Amazon Prime Membership and paying for crappy service when Prime isn't offered.Case:The case is lightweight and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone.  After the first night of use I noticed that the USB cable didn't really fit in the slot.  The USB cable will not fit in secure enough to stay.  After looking at it closer looks like the space below the USB slot has plenty of space cut out but the space above the top just barely clears the slot.  So I'm guessing you have to make sure it's in there or it will just fall out.The power button is a little hard to press with the case on.  I bought this case as a temporary solution until Otterbox comes out with a case (in Blue on July 14th).  Once I get a better case I will be putting this case in a drawer.Edit: 9-28-13The case has completely fallen apart.  The black ring has come apart from the clear back.  And it seem as if the clear back didn't protect the phone as much as you would think.  There are scratches on the back of the case.  And the only times I took it off was to pull the battery or add a memory card.
2	I like that it has some hardness to it but the case is not idealIt is very slippery on the backthe sides are ok very hard feeling knobs but will not slip.alignment is perfect!The plastic back also is not perfect has blemishes from material
2	I've ordered many cases for the S3 so I have many to compare with.Pros:- Looks good- Transparent back is nice for a white phone- Side texture adds grippinessCons:- Bad buttons cover. No clicking feedback from the button and buttons either would not respond or get stuck.If this had a better button design it would be a keeper.
2	I like how its clear but weeks later it began to get beige on the white part i didnt care for it
0	I had a dash mount holder for my Garmin which I loved so I thought this would be great for my iPhone.  However I have the Otterbox Defender case on my phone (which I do love!) and I guess with the case it's just too heavy.  The mount won't keep the phone upright enough to see it.  Also I have a Honda CRV and the dash is slightly curved so it doesn't sit well on it.  Might be good for other people but it didn't work for me.
2	I had high hopes for this product as it was reviewed very positively .I tried it out without the phone and the suction did not stick at all. It lasted about 10 minutes and then fell right off the mount.  I tried several times under normal weather conditions and it absolutely does not stay together.I haven't put my phone in it yet because it isn't secure at all and am considering using some super double sided tape to rig it together but should I really have to rig a product like this in the first place.I'm getting an extended battery for my Evo 4g which will increase the weight of the phone and honestly don't this this mount can handle it.I've got a few days to think about it before I return it.I can't recommend this at all.
2	8/3/11:  I no longer have confidence in the base unit.  Re the problem I noted below with temperature changes I noticed that the problem did not occur if I suctioned the unit to the windshield instead of the base so that's what I had been doing.  Now that it is summer and the temperature only goes from hot to hotter here in Fla I decided to try the base again but it keeps falling off.So...I would say the part that holds the phone and suctions to the car is very good.  There are a lot of positions and angles you can adjust to make it comfortable.  The base is not worthwhile.______________2/2/11:  Now that I've had it for a little longer I want to mention that the suction does not last when there are temperature changes.  For example if you put it in your car when it is 70 degrees then park and let it sit while temps drop to 50s and then you get in the next day it will tend to fall off which is a problem.  I notice it more when temps drop than when temps increase if that makes sense (it was a problem in the winter; not in the summer).Re my problem attaching the product to my dash what I did was take a section of wire hanger bend it into an S shape and snake one part throught he available loop and the other through a vent that shoots air to my windshield when in defrost mode.  Holds it perfectly!_______________I bought this because when my new car did not come with a built-in nav system I decided to use a navigation program that came on my blackberry.  I like that if I ever decide to get a navigation system I'll be able to use this base for it.This is a very good though not perfect product.  The contraption that holds the phone is excellent - I really like how maneuverable it is. By attaching the phone holder part backwards to how it is shown in the picture I was able to place my phone right along the top of my dash so it doesn't block my windshield.  Doing it this way makes it a little harder to remove the phone holder part from the base but I haven't had a need or desire to do that.  The suction cup holds very well.  The weight of the base is also good.The negatives relate to securing the product to my dash.  I could not use the mounting hook - the lip of the base is up a bit and it pulls the hook off the dash.  I'm thinking about buying some thick foam tape and trying to build up the hook a bit.  Without it the product did not seem secure enough and actually came loose while I was doing some serious accelleration.  This might be because the bottom of hte base curves a bit so the middle was not 100% touching the dash (so there is less friction than otherwise).To fix this issue I took a gel pad that I already had (a 3x5 piece of jelly-like sticky plastic that you can buy almost anywhere - they advertise it for placing on your dash to hold your cell phone flat or keys or glasses) and placed the base on top of that. It seems very secure now and has not budged.  I think the gel pad can be purchased for about $4.
2	It works fine for the intended purpose but the only place in my car that the suction cup would hold was on the windshield. I ended up replacing it with their mount that sticks on.  Much more reliable.
2	The suction cup sticks well to the window. The cradle seems loose on the arm and I worry it will bounce off. Need a different connector from arm to cradle.
2	It must have been a good product since i have not heard anything bad to the person i gave this product...
2	I bought this as a replacement after my iCarpus stand began to fall apart in less than a month. It costs almost twice as much but looks alot tougher.The stand looks like it's made of hard rubber and appears fairly durable. You assemble the stand by sticking a rubber on either side. You can adjust the width/height of the stand somewhat but that requires you to dissemble/reassemble the stand again.The stand is for my preschool child who uses a iTouch. So far he seems to greatly prefer the old iCarpus stand that he could attached and adjust himself. The iZel stand is not getting much use and I may have to return it and go back to the old stand.
2	For the price I am not happy. It does as advertised just feels like it will break. Plus that it folds flat for travel minus that for a piece of molded rubber(?) it is [...] bucks.
2	Right out of the box the Morphie Juice Pack does work as advertised.  I was able to get the case charged up and ready to go with no time flat.  The battery light indicators on the back of the case easily make it so you can tell exactly how much power you do have.My main complaint is that the case doesn't protect the iPhone's top edges.  It's a sleek fit on both sides and works well.  But the top is exposed.  So if you drop your expensive iPhone and it lands on the top you might have a problem.  Same with the edges.  You've got a sleek fit so you might have a problem if you drop it wrong.My only other complaint is that I got used to charging the iPhone with the stock Apple adapter.  With the case on you can only charge it and sync with a USB cable.  This might work well for some people but it just didn't work that well with me.  Just be prepared if you decide to try this case.
2	I bought this before I bought a battery pack with the initials RS.  This offer no protection for the phone.  I later purched the battery pack by RS and a Clarifi case and am so mad I spent the $100 for this.  I would wait for it to go below $50 and then it would be worth buying.
0	looks alright but didn't fit on my grandpas iphone 3G.  it fell off when ever he took it out of his pocket.
2	While the privacy aspect serves the purpose well this screen cover darkens the screen dramatically.  I had to adjust the display for a brighter screen but it does not improve much and also shortens battery life.  In addition it dramatically diminishes the clarity and the screen looks slightly blurred.  You can see the diagonal lines running across the screen.  I've had no issues with screen touch sensitivity.  I will more than likely go back to my regular screen protector as I miss the sharp bright screen display.Update: Removed this filter half hour after writing this review ... it's that bad.
2	Not a product I would buy again as it left bubbles all over the screen Lint free cloth was good to clean my eyeglasses
0	I agree with what others have posted. The protector applies easily and the privacy works well without dimming the screen too much. Unfortunately the protector is so thick that the touchscreen no longer works after the screen is applied.
2	I liked the idea of a screen protector since I constantly carry my iPhone with me and didn't want it to get scratched.  That said the screen protector became so gross overtime that I HAD to peel it off.  What do I mean by gross?  The edges of the sticker seemed to attract makeup dust and other gunk making the phone look VERY unsanitary.  Even when I tried putting my phone in a separate clean pocket it still picked things up whenever I put it up to my face to talk.  If you're purely using the headphones or a bluetooth device this may be less of an issue for you.  However as someone who wears make up and was constantly picking it up this was a big issue for me.  It especially had a tendency to collect around the button and was virtually impossible to clean off.Now that I have removed the protector this is no longer a problem.  I find that it doesn't seem to attract makeup anymore and even when it does I can easily clean it off with a gentle cloth.  I also haven't had any issues with scratches and dents despite regular use making the think the screen is durable enough on its own.The bottom line is that I would recommend this if you are putting it up to your cheek to talk and wear makeup because it can get gross pretty fast and is hard to clean.
0	I didn't expect the quality to be this bad.  Out of the three that I got one has an uneven circle shape for the home button.What's really bad is that once you've put the screen protector on you won't get a clear screen protector.  You can actually see the SOAP FILM like that on a bubble all over the screen.  I waited for a few days but the soap film are still visible.  It's extremely irritating and unattractive.  I would not recommend this item at all! I
2	a lot of money for just one piece of plastic but it works and at least they've made the installation simpler...
2	This protects the screen but doesn't really look all that great.  Oily shimmer to the screen when looking at your reflection can be a little irritating.  Also I tried over and over again but I couldn't get this to fit the phone.  I got it perfectly centered and every edge of the case was bubbled up because it was overlapping the silver bezel.  I hair smaller on each side and it would have been perfect.As it is the one I got wasn't that great and I can't recommend this to anybody else based on the one that I got.
2	One speck of dirt on one of the three screens and they're done. Unuseable.  Wish it was a 5 pack.  I went through a 3 pack in 20 hours.Boo.3/5
2	The short of it:-The ringer has an inherent flaw in it and if it turns off on its own it will not turn back on without a hard reset.  This has happened to my phone and the ringer will only stay on for a couple of hours. Thus every few hours I have to hard reset my phone if I want to hear it ring. Palm refuses to replace the phone and refuses to create a fix for it as it is a registry issue from what I have read on the Palm Forums.-Once the phone goes on roaming I practically  have to reset it to get it off roaming.-I consistently use the comm manager to turn off and on wireless/cellular due to flying all the time and I often have to go through the motions two or three times to get it to actually execute.-The battery is ok for a smart phone.-The on board internet browser gets the job done for me.-The call quality has been fine and it rarely drops calls on me.-All my messaging capabilities work ok though I can't figure out how to timestamp incoming texts annoying.I'd not recommend this phone to others due to my issues with it. If the ringer worked I'd probably give it 4 stars but since it is a phone and it is supposed to ring it's kind of a pain in the neck.
0	The Palm Treo breaks.  Then the replacement (refurbished unit) breaks and then the second replacement unit (refurbished) breaks.  The overall design is good but the manufacturing appears to be lacking.
2	I got this phone from a friend because my Samsung Rant died on me. It's not a bad phone I like the fact that you can use Wi-Fi certain apps and it's like Windows on your computer. The downside is the battery power on it is horrible I have to charge it twice a day. Also it freezes on me a lot so I constantly have to take the battery out to restart it. Sometimes it sends old text messages randomly to people so it's kind of odd. I'm glad I got it for free because I'd be upset if I spent money on this low grade Blackberry.
2	This could have been an excellent case.  It could have been but isn't it's just sort of fair.It's a simple zippered case (as in the picture -- inside dimensions roughly 3x2x1.  But it's not really designed with some thought about headsets so you have problems like the headset power button being pushed on closing.So it sort of might do the job -- it barely does it for my BlueAnt Z9i if I put it in sideways and carefully.  But I'm not sufficiently pleased to make a recommendation.Construction seems good enough for something like this and it came with an attached snap hook (for what?).I sure don't get the wristband thing.
2	Didn't work for my needs. Price was so low that it didn't matter. Still looking for right fit. It is my fault. product and delivery were excellent.
2	The product works as expected. Using this along with a standard MicroUSB cable I can transfer files to and from my Samsung Fascinate as well as charge the phone. However because the fit into the phone is tight a fairly hard tug is required to disconnect the cable. I haven't had this problem with other MicroUSB cables that I've used with my phone.
0	This battery arrived on time and was visually identical to the original OEM battery.  However it quickly lost the ability to retain a charge and requires daily recharging when the original OEM battery lasted 3-5 days when new.  It's no better than the worn out 2-1/2 year old original battery that it replaced.
0	once charged this battery lasts about 6 hours without mush usage.  First we thought it was great nice fit appeared to charge just fine.  Maybe I got a lemon maybe it's the generic brand.  I would buy this one again
0	I don't know if I just got a bad set but all 3 were way off on the cutting. To line up the ear hole it causes the button hole to be misaligned and on top of that the whole thing was too large. it caused bubbles around the whole rim because it would not fit inside of the rim which is slightly higher than the screen. Horrible QC to say the least.
2	These just didn't lay as well on the screen as other brands I've used.  There were more bubbles and it curled on some edges making it hard to fit into my case.  If I ever decide to use protective screens again I'll spend more money for a better product.
2	This cover protects the screen nicely from scratches however it smudges something fierce.  Maybe I only feel this way because I bought the 3GS with oleophobic screen but when it smudges signifcantly more after you put a screen on it you tend to notice.  Other that that it does keep the screen from getting scratched it does not negatively impact the touch sensitivity of the phone and it doesn't cost a lot of money.  Well worth the investment.
2	Kind of a pain to apply. Maybe I am not that savvy however they stuck good for about two weeks and then got dirt or whatever underneath and ended up scratching my screen or peeling off in the corners. Good price though.
2	I ended up buying these to use on a different phone then an iPhone. Just cut them down to size and stuck them on they lasted about 3-4 months before I would want to switch them out.
0	I bought these from wal-mart and all three screen protectors are bigger than the iPhone 3g screen.  They were intentionally made that way so that the screen would peel and wear off fast.They produce a lot of glare compare to other screen savers that I've used in the past.Scratched easily finger prints etc...  The point is that these screen protectors suck!The best ones that I've used are the protectors that bought from Fry's electronics made from Japan.  Unfortunately Fry's doesn't sell those anymore.
0	JMHO; They'll never look as good as the phone's screen itself; everyone I know who try to put them on wind up with stuff stuck under the screen protector creating bubbles that will make your phone's beautiful screen look like crap. Watch with wonder as your 'gift' drives them nuts trying to re-install the product over and over again winding up in frustration as they can never get it on quite right. After a month I gave up on screen protectors for my iphone; a year later still no scratches (but then I carry mine in a holster not my pocket or just tossed in a purse so YMMV) and the screen still looks pristine; I guess that's why they used glass and not plastic for the screen.
0	I purchased this bluetooth and it would not charge.  I emailed the company and they re sent me another one and it wouldnt charge either.  i purchased the same blue tooth from another online company and it would not work either  so now i am having to go through motorolla.
2	I had to return this item because I received too many complaints from people on the other end of the line.  I wanted it to work because of the small size and flip shut down but it had to go.
2	Compared to my old bluetooth that I never used because people could never understand me it is much better.  It does actually block most noise in the background.  My issue is that I like to have my windows down on the freeway when it's 80deg or less.  With my windows up and the radio on medium while driving on the freeway people can hear me clearly but once I roll down my windows are turn on my air condition on full blast people only hear my voice breaking up.  So it only does half of what it says I've heard other people say it works for them even in the wind but apparently not for everyone. I'm a bit disappointed.  At least my old bluetooth allowed me to listen to my music while exercising but that one a little more expensive then this one.
0	Though when this headset works it is fine audio and comfortable to wear I do not recommend it because it does not hold a charge for very long. Previous headsets that I have owned have lasted at least a week with only one hour a day use on average. This one requires charging every other day.
2	I like the style of this headset but I have had to purchase two of these.  The first one barely lasted past the first year before breaking so I am not sure about the quality of these.  They seem to have gotten cheap on the ear pieces now as they are proned to breaking easily or getting caught on something in your pocket and getting flung out of it which I have done before.
2	I got this to replace my Plantronics Voyager 510. I found the Plantronics over-the-ear piece to be too bulky always pushing the top of my ear far away from my head. Also I found the Plantronics to be uncomfortable for long periods of time. However the boom mic was superior. It picked up the voice very easily and clearly at the other end. The Motorola does not pick up my voice unless I hold it firmly against the side of my face pointing to the mouth. [The boom tends to swing away from the face.] I tried all of the ear fittings hoping I would find one that more securely held it in place to no avail. It is more comfortable for me to wear but inferior regarding its functionality.
2	Fitment is near impossible and the thing will not stay on my head. Sound quality is average at best. Plus it completely plugs your ear so you hear nothing out of that ear. Really sorry I bought this and getting something else.
2	2 good things about the Jabra SP700:  Price and the speaker works well for the user.The bad:  It cuts out on the person on the other end delivering jerky speech and partial words.
0	I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my brother in law - it arrived on time but in a clear plastic bag.  No box.  Considering the cost i was surprised and now may return it.  Without the box it makes me think it feel off a truck and i don't know how i'm supposed to gift it as planned.UPDATE:  difficulties with the shipper he offered to send a box and did but it was not a gift box and i had to go out and find another.  irritating but the real problem came out when my brother in law tried to use it.  it never worked!  he even took it to the apple store to try to get them to help no good.  i sent it back and requested a refund AND NEVER GOT THE REFUND.  i complained to Amazon who gave me a store credit and apologized but i never heard back from the seller!
0	The materials and design of this product are far inferior to the Cliphanger which comes without the light Cliphanger stick and adhesive pad CLEAR orCliphanger-Universal Caddy for Handheld Devices Colors May Varyor with an LED which is available at the Cliphanger site.  Don't be fooled into thinking that these are identical.  The Deluxe SmartClip's light is difficult to use and very dim.  The adhesive is faulty.  I dropped my phone 3 times the first day (and I still had the SmartClip in my hand).  Avoid.
2	We've been using Clip Hangers for years & LOVE them!  This one is OK the light on the NEW ones we bought worked about twice so getting one with a light on it is not worth the money.  I went back to the regular Clip Hangers.  They now have Clip Hangers that you can swivel out of the way if it needs to be placed in the way of your cell phones camera.  But the Deluxe is just not worth the money
2	I got this a couple of months ago. One thing I did notice was that if you don't use the screen protector that comes with the case. there is a good chance that the case itself will push up against the bottom of your protector. This will cause a bubble that can't be pressed down since the case is in the way.A few weeks ago the thin piece of plastic at the very bottom cracked. Just today I found out that there was another crack on the circle part of the case on the back that holds the 2 pieces together. I just found it ridiculous that this case got such good reviews initially so I decided to write this to help even things out. It's good at first glance even in person but after a few short months you'll probably end up needing another case.
2	Get what you pay for with this case.  Its hard to put on hard to take off hard to keep on.  Don't waste your money here.  Buy a neopreen Otterbox or an &#34;in case&#34; that is similarly designed but better built.
0	Upon first receiving the case I realized the bottom half would not fit snug into the top.  However since the slight gap was not a big deal I proceeded to use it as my primary case.  Unfortunately have less than a month of use the case has broken and cracked in numerous places after just regular use (I did not obviously throw my phone or drop it several times on the ground).  The color is fading and chipped in certain areas.  This case is absolutely horrible.  I do no recommend this to anyone.  Even the low price isn't worth it.
2	My husband loved this at first; however his love was short lived.  The case started not closing properly so his phone would fall out.  This is a big concern since you can't fit a case on the phone when in this.  He ended up switching to an Otterbox which provided the protection and convenience.
2	The case is sturdy and the right price but thestiching is starting to fray. It is not coming apart justfuzzy at the stichings.
2	QuickFlipCase for iPhone 4 and NEW iPhone 4S (AT&T;/Verizon Versions) Grantwood Technology's Premium Leather Horizontal Flip Case (Black)The Quick Flip Case is well made reasonably priced stylish has a soft protective interior lining and my iPhone 4S fits perfectly even with the CDMA bumper attached.  The plastic belt clip has a ratcheted pivot and the end of it is molded to securely attach to a belt.  The case remains horizontal rides close to your side and the magnetic cover flap stays put yet easily lifts out of the way.  Grantwood Technology did a great job designing this case.This holster is exactly what I was looking for. If there's anything negative about it I haven't found it.  Five stars all the way!07/15/2012 UpdateAfter the third plastic belt clip snapped off my Quick Flip Case Grantwood Technology was nice enough to replace it with a more durable case sporting a metal clip.  Grantwood said this replacement is an older version but I like it just as much as the Quick Flip Case.  The only real difference I can see is that the clip doesn't swivel so the case stays in the horizontal position.  Since this is my preferred carry position this doesn't present a problem for me.I do want to add that Grantwood Technology has been wonderful to deal with.  They stand behing their products 100-percent and their customer service is top notch ... Five stars all the way.06/20/2012 UpdateThe bad news:I'm now on my third Quick Flip Case.  The plastic belt clip hinge broke off the first case; and the plastic belt clip assembly seperated from the back of the second replacement case.The good news:1) Grantwood Technology is excellent to do business with; they stand behind their products and guarantees completely.  Grantwood immediately shipped no-cost replacements to me without requiring the return of the defective cases.2) Before doing so they gave me the option of a full refund a replacement or an upgrade. I like this case so much I chose the replacement over the refund.3) Grantwood Technology had the manufacturer correct the problem on the newest release of this case so the clip assembly shouldn't seperate from the case again.Although I took one star away from the original five star rating I still really like this case.  And if this one should become defective I know Grantwood Technology will continue to do the right thing and offer a full refund.
2	I would return it except it would cost that much just to return it.The thing charges.  I'll give it that.But* when charging it causes the iPhone to emit a very noticeable high-pitched sound during play.* the cord is laughably short.* the craftsmanship is well I guess what you should expect for a few bucks.  I had to push and wiggle it into my (Dodge Ram 1500) lighter outlet to get the proper connection.  I took it out and in my bag for a day or two and it fell apart (the tip fell off).I bought this as an alternative to the $30 AT&T; one but I guess I'll have to cough that up to get something with a little quality.I think this product should not be on the market even granting the caveat you get what you pay for.  It represents itself as an alternative to the brand one; it isn't.
0	I guess you get what you pay for.  This thing worked initially but it gradually started to smell like a small electrical fire.  After 6 months of occasional use the thing burned out entirely.For S&Gs; I took the thing apart.  It's not horribly made but it does have a design flaw that is practically guaranteed to cause electrical failure.  The failure won't burn up your car or burn out your iPhone but it will stop working.
0	I bought three of these things about a year ago.  I gave one to my girlfriend one to my brother and I kept the other one for myself.At first they worked great.  But within less then a year each of them failed.  None of them work now.In short these things must have some kind of design flaw resulting in a failure after a few months.  Don't waste your money.  There are many other similar products on the market for a similar price.
2	I bought this with the hope i can finally charge it on the go in my car.....but to my dismay the plug is to fat to fit through the case opening.  I went with a USB cable instead.  If you have an Otterbox don't waste your money on this.
2	This product worked great for a couple weeks but after I while I noticed the phone was no longer charging. The red light still comes on but the phone does not receive a charge. Tested it in another vehicle with same results. Not sure if recent iPhone updates had anything to do with it or if it just died. Looks like I'll have to spend the extra $ for a name brand charger.
2	This is a very cheap product in cost and quality. Poor design and very cheap plastic. I bought 2 and only 1 of them works.
0	Amazon shall remove this product or vendor from their list.The connector does not fit the 3G or 3GS IPhone pure trash.I should have requested my money back too much waste of timeand energy. Shame on you Amazon for not having a better quality controlover the products that you list or the vendors you do business with.If you want to waste your time and money buy this product.Thanks
2	It works very well never had any issues with it well worth the money used for quite some time but now have iPhone5.

0	By pass this thing and get an iPhone!Freezes frequently and requires a reset.Little ball thingy you use to navigate is a joke.Small screen.Fails to connect to WiFi hotspots too many times.Teeny tiny keys.Update software from RIM is a farce. No Shortcuts anywhere after install. No way to find the program executable as there are no Entries anywhere to get to it. No where. Once you trick it right after install or re-install or re-re-install the update process stalls several times and then times out and you are stuck.FORGET IT. LIFE IS TOO SHORT.GET YOURSELF AN iPHONE!!!
2	It is Good but the Camera is of very poor quality.. It has lot of functions but sorry to say the phone was lost due to my negligence...
2	I bought this as a replacement for a Plantronics Voyager 520. (Lost it so needed a quick replacement.) I found the 520 to be very comfortable. The way it channeled sound into the ear worked very well.Pros:* Has a mute function. I listen in on lots of telecons for business so I really needed this.* Sound quality is very good both for both ends (if you can keep it in your ear)* Buttons are easy to access and operate.Cons:* I have not been able to find any way to make this fit me. With the tips that is came with it managed to be both painful and yet fall out easily. any turn of the head and it would be hanging there in space. I also had a hard time hearing it because it would end up too far out of my ear. I could use the oblong tip and get it wedged to where it would stay better but it hurt terribly. I tried a 3rd party ear gel and that holds it a bit better but still hurts. I end up having to push it back in every couple minutes especially if I'm moving around at all. And for the record I've never had any problems with stereo earbuds or ear-canal phones.* Related to fit when trying to stuff it back in your ear it is really easy to accidentall hit the big call control button and cut off the call.I really can't imagine how anyone can use this for any time at all. I've made it work for several weeks but I'm looking for a replacement.
2	The answer switch is too close to the off switch and sometimes is hard to answer.. Sound quality is OK nothing to write home about.. overall it works as indicated but not a super duper product to write home about...Also is kind of hard to tell which way increases the volume or decreases it...
2	The main reason i got this case is because i loved how you could see the chrome edge around the screen. It shows it this way in the pictures and even on video reviews i've seen. Well it seems they have changed the design of the case and the chrome edge is no longer visible. The case looks pretty cool but it does not have as much grip as i thought it would and it is a lint trap!
2	it has a good design. but dont fit well the iphone.was a mistake. but i already get another otter this really fit.
2	OtterBox is a good brand but is simply huge is great for when you have small kids it protects you phone but otherwise it's just to big.
0	The product did not work as promised...it did not fit my iPhone 3G so had to return it back. Amazon was prompt in returning the refund..
2	So I've had the case for about two months now... Yes it does protect your phone from anything the Fort Nox of iPhone cases but it has its down sides too:Pros:Great fit great design ultimate protectionCons: the built in screen protector get bubbles in it frequently the bottom where you insert the usb is positioned so far up that it makes it not work with almost every cool iphone accessory out there.For example: I have used the Liquid Aux car adapter for over a year (which you simply slide your iphone into it and it charges and runs the music through your aux port) With the Otterbox the port is so far up in the case you can't plug your iphone into anything that play music or charges your phone (except the original apple charger).It is hands down the best for protection but unless you beat your phone into the ground on a daily basis I wouldn't recommend this case.Functionality always wins and this case doesn't cut it.
2	heavy duty box for and outdoors person.Is moisture resistant and has saved my phone from moisture damage at least twice.The clear cover sticks to your phone screen giving an oily contact appearance.  I fixed that by drying really well and putting a tiny pinch of powder on it then blowing it off.  Put it together no more oily spots.Is bulky and doesn't fit well in the windshield mounted iPhone holder.The holder that comes with it is terrible.  The phone falls out easily but since the case is so tough your phone won't break your phone.  Since the holder is so bad you'll put your phone in your pocket which works good however lint will build up on your camera lens which the Otterbox seems to 'hold'.  Occasional swabbing with a q-tip cleans your camera lens.Don't substitue with another brand.  If you are an outdoors person you need this protection.
2	I had high hopes for this product because this was recommended by the dealer as the best protection for my iphone. Within the first few weeks my iphone popped out of my holder at least 4 times and caused it to drop onto concrete floor. Fortunately the inner shell was hard so my iphone did not break. Don't buy this product if you want to wear it on your belt because the clip on does not work!
2	I am very dissapointed with this product.....The day i received it i thought this thing looks great and with the built in screen protector to it makes it even  better for little over $12.00 i paid i thought this is a steal. Well fast forward over a week later the outer layer of the black silicon skin starts to rub off make it look like some dirt that needs to be wiped off. Worse this thing is a lint magnet it's like I'm holding a furry kitten against my ear every time i use my iphone.....As the saying goes you get what you pay for..........
0	Don't get me wrong this is a good case but not any better than a couple others on Amazon for half the cost with free shipping if you are a Prime Member.  I contacted Otterbox Customer Service and they were very unresponsive and abrupt.  I have three cases (two iPhones) and I would rate this behind a popular one on Amazon.The case offer good protection but the screen protector makes it difficult to view the phones apps in bright light.  Also the snap on holster does not hold the phone if you are wearing a jacket.  The clip style holster barely hold the phone in place and the jacket rubbing against the phone is enough for the phone to fall to the ground.  You need to be careful because if you are on grass snow or in a loud area you will not hear the phone fall.
2	I purchased a Defender for my wife (the pink/black one) when she got her iPhone and eventually got a black one for myself. First the good things: it offers excellent protection from drops scrapes and the occasional rain storm. When your phone is clipped face-in on the belt clip it's pretty much impervious to most shock and any kind of screen damage.About the only thing it won't protect against is getting dropped in a body of water. It's water resistant but NOT waterproof. Most of the phone is covered by plastic or silicone except for two holes on the bottom for the speakers and a cloth cover over the part where you put your ear. I've had my iPhone in the Defender for about 3 months and it looks as shiny as the day I bought it.A few caveats: the plastic film that covers the screen has a weird oily pooling effect that's distracting. I've found that a light dusting of corn starch on the side that contacts the iPhone will get rid of it for a while.The silicone outer casing picks up dirt and lint like nobody's business. I have to wipe it down with a damp cloth several times a week or it's a phone-sized fuzzball. A minute in a blue jeans pocket will coat the thing. This is true for any case with this kind of non-shiny silicone though.The case adds a significant amount of bulk to the iPhone so if you have small pockets or don't like the idea of clipping it to your belt all the time look elsewhere.
2	Case fits phone well but is a little bulky.  Some of the features were more difficult to work with. It gives the phone good protection.
2	Bought this for my iPhone 3GS for use on the golf course.I've had a couple of drops but it protected my iPhone without any problems.  What I didn't notice at the time was that a couple of grains of sand got into the case.  The phone moves just enough inside the case for the sand to get inside and scratch up the back side of my iPhone.This leads me to my next issue.  The rubber outer cover is too tacky.  I believe the sand problem was caused by the tacky rubber not releasing all the sand when I tried brushing it off.  If you keep this phone in your pocket it will pickup every lint and crud from your pocket.Finally The plastic film that protects LCD causes an oil slick effect.  There various ways to prevent this from happening (search Google) but Otterbox could have used a different material to prevent this happening in the first place.Good case for protection against major drops & hits.  Not too good against sand...
2	My otterbox came with no instructions but it was fairly easy to put together.  The otterbox does keep the pone safe.  I even got to test out the protection the Otterbox provides.The belt vlip is completey useless.  After I placed my phone in the belt clip several minutes later it just popped out.  Later I went and sat in the car and before I could shut the door the Iphone Popped out  I dropped my iPhone more times due to the belt clip that I ever have dropped my iPhone(s) since the iPhone came out.  I even placed the ottherbox belt clip w iPhone attached to cup holder in the car and agian it popped out.I placed the iPhone in backwards into the otterbox belt clip and was able to keep the iphone engaged with the belt clip in the car as above but  when standing outside the car and not moving the iPhone popped out again.Now the case does a great job protecting the iPhone... good thing because the belt clip is really bad.
2	I purchased my case in April 2009 and was very excited to receive it. It installed fairy easily and I had installed an Apple screen protector directly on the phone before installing the case to cure the oily film problem. That fix works great and gives you an additional layer of protection. The problem I had with the case was the echo. Callers started to complain that they heard themselves talking back in their phone. I dismissed it the first couple times I was told about the echo. Blamed it on the wonderful AT&T service. However the complaints kept coming in and it got to the point callers were hanging up on me. I Googled iPhone echo and returned some results about dust & dirt in the microphone and even called Apple & AT&T neither were helpful. I never suspected the case until I removed the case and swapped out a thinner leather case while on a trip. Much to my surprise no more complaints. As a test I had a friend call me from 50 feet away once with no case & no echo then with the OtterBox and sure enough an echo. Now the case sits in my desk drawer.
2	I bought the Defender and dumped it. Everything I liked about the iPhone was gone once it went inside the Defender. The oil slick effect on the screen protector was an absolute disaster. The iPhone's screen sensitivity was severely reduced by this case and you can't easily get to the keyboard characters near the edges because of the Defender's bulky construction. You may be able to run over it without destroying your iPhone but you'll never get used to the shortcomings this case presents you with. Take my advice: BUY the COMMUTER case instead!
2	I purchased these because I've owned Sennheiser products in the past and I've always been very impressed with what Sennheiser offers.First off these do work as advertised and these do work very well with the iphone. They're a great hands free set and the mic and control button work very well. People will have no trouble hearing what you're saying as the mic works very well. I've yet to talk to anyone who realized I was using a hands free set.I did expect more sound wise from these ear buds. The low end is just so weak! Highs are very good mids are okay but sadly the low is just not present. I've experimented with all different size earpads and had no luck.Bottom line if you listen to acoustic rock modern rock classic rock or jazz you'll be pleased with the sound these put out. If you're more into pop and hip hop or classical you'll likely find the low end really lacking. The overall clarity of these buds is very good but for the price of the buds I found the audio performance to be unbalanced. I don't like overwhelming bass but if your ear buds cannot produce any decent low end bass notes then you're really not hearing all of your music.I've yet to hear a better iphone hands free set but I'm still looking.
0	Sennheiser used to be reputable; now I must agree with those who say these earbuds are junk.  The shorter earbud worked intermittently at first (plugging and unplugging sometimes cleared the problem) and I like the asymmetric form so much that I kept hoping they would 'break in'.  Instead they just broke with the shorter earbud not working at all.  Too bad back to the kludge-but-robust Sure adapter with old Sony earbuds.
2	First things first make sure you are ordering the right headset.  These fit a 3.5 mm jack NOT the old 2.5 mm that you would find in most other/older phones.  Easy way to test if you're not sure take an iPod headset (or any headset you use for a mp3 or CD player) and see if it fits.  If it does than you are looking at the right headset.Before getting into too much detail let me first give a concise Pro/Con summation:Pro:Best earbuds on any headphones I've ever used.Con:The microphone is as equally bad as the earbuds are good.Despite being slightly shocked by just how good the earbuds were these are of no use to me if the microphone is unusable.The Sennheiser MM50 iP Earbuds / Headset have the most outstanding sound I've ever hear from a headset but an incredibly BAD microphone.  Also the Sennheisers were engineered to keep the microphone close to your mouth by placing it at the Y of the headphone split and making on line short enough to pull the mic close to your mouth.  This is an awful design that should never be repeated.  I found myself constantly having to repeat myself when talking on this headset.I can say though that with the Sennheiser Earbuds I could hear details in my music that I never heard before.  A simply amazing sound with outstanding isolation capabilities.  In a very noisy gym I could keep my iPhone at a low volume and still hear great detail to my music.In comparison the Ultimate Ears MetroFi headset keeps the normal symmetrical Y shape to the earbuds and places the microphone on one of the lines close to your mouth.  Having my wife call me on her Chocolate 3 phone I was at first disappointed. Did you forget to bring the headset with you? I asked.  Nope she had them on.Over the years between the two of us we've probably used about a dozen different headsets between the two of us and the MetroFi set was the clear winner when it came to microphone quality.  Funny thing is to look at them you wouldn't think it.For earbud quality test I compared them to my Sony J2 Metrofi 170vi and iPod earbuds (all noise isolating except the iPod).  Sound quality places the MetroFi 170vi down by the iPod headset and sadly they were probably equal to the iPod headset for noise isolation as well.  The Sony and J2 earbuds were roughly equal in both categories far behind the Sennheiser and slightly less far ahead of the MetroFi 170vi and iPod set.Comfort wise I would rate the four as follows: Sennheiser (again by far) MetroFi 170vi Sony then J2 (So bad they caused one of my ears to be sore for days)Durability could probably be a little better but they haven't failed me yet.  So far just one of the 1 1/2 inch sleaves attached to the earbuds has come off.I would recommend the Metrofi 170vi set over these.  IMHO when wearing headphones that are also a headset microphone quality trumps headset quality.edit 11/28/2010I earbud died shortly after this review. It kills me 'cause for comfort and sound quality nothing beats these... nothing even comes close to these. Unfortunately a crappy mic and poor durability make this a lousy product.
2	These sound a lot better than the Apple In-Ear earphones with remote and mic. They have more bass and sound pretty good for the price. They work with the iPhone as they have a mic and button but no volume controls unfortunately.That's where the praise ends though. The mic housing is a bit heavier than I would like and I don't like how the right cable is made to go behind your neck. Also no case is included. Also talking on the phone with these is not comfortable at all because of the seal they make in your ears you can't hear yourself talk! You therefor have to pull out the earbuds a bit when talking on the phone.While these do sound pretty good for music I regret my purchase and wish I had just bought some better audiophile earbuds without the mic instead.
2	Bought this to fix it to my Honda Civic dashboard. Front Window is too far at the end. It doesn't fixed as I liked on the dashboard. I am using it at the front window close to the mirror. Not so good but useful. Provider sent it without any problems.
2	I just received my BoxWave TinyMount.  I can tell from the build that this mount is much better than the ones I've tried from Fry's or BestBuy.  So the first thing I noticed is that the suction cup seems super flat there is a lock mount that you twist when you place the mount on a flat surface (like the windshield or on the included flat coaster adapter).  I did not have a need to use the coaster as I already have a flat surface to use the TinyMount at first it did not seem like it would stick but I simply added a few drops of water to the suction cup and attempted to attach the mount and it has been solid.  I drive a truck and even on bumpy roads this unit holds without issue.  I like how easy it is to mount my iPhone and how well it holds a grip.if anything changes I will come back to update my review but at the moment it's fantastic and exactly what I was looking for.  This mount is so easy to adjust angles so it faces you easily.EDIT -- 1/29/14So the mount broke in almost 1 month from owning it.  I contacted the seller via amazon and they sent me a label to mail them back the broken mount and they refunded me my money.How did it break?  It was a very hot weekend on Monday I got into the car and I went to try and pull the arms apart to fit my phone and the tiny neck leading to the base broke with almost no effort.  I did get my Money back and maybe this mount requires you to remove it from your car on a hot day.--Since then I bought new car mount from a local chain store from manufacturer: ADURO (u-touch) renamed to u-grip now.  but what I like is that I've owned the new mount for over a month and it's been really positive.  it is not compact like the boxwave but it has a feature: side buttons that effortlessly expand the arms that hold your phone so you can remove it quickly and easily.  you can drop your phone into place there is a button that holds your phone into place nicely.  I think if boxwave adds something like this I may buy another product especially since they were so nice to refund my money when I had a product that did not survive.
2	No frills but it works.  I have since taken to using a different mount that doesn't require clipping the phone in.
2	It works great after you glue or velcro it to the dashboard.  I did not expect to have that problem.  next?
2	Feels like cheaper plastic and I feel hard to insert iPhone 5. Had to use both hands every time. Expected much better quality. Won't recommend.
2	Made of cheap plastic but will do the job.  I don't think it will hold up for the long haul so if you looking for something temporary...then go for it.  It's cheap but functional.
2	I have this mount and have used it a few times and will say that it does a good job at holding the iphone 3G. The extension arm is very short but that does mean it doesn't have a lot of movement like other brands have. It's a solid product.My only real issue is that it's a little difficult to get the phone in and out of the mount. If you have any type of a case this will not work for you. I now use an otterbox case and there is no way it will work with this mount and to be fair it doesn't say that it will.This mount is a great mount only if you have an iphone 3G or ipod touch and don't have any type of protection on it. If you do you will want to look for another option.
2	Item is compatible with both my Ipod Nano 2nd Generation and 4th Generation Ipod Touch. Cheaply designed but does as said.Overall for price I am satisfied.
0	I bought two of these one worked and the other never worked at all.  Very poor quality but I didn't expect much so. . . .
2	I purchased this to go in my docking station at home. It connects just fine to all Apple devices I own (iPhone 3GS 4 various iPod nanos and minis). However the AC part of the charger eventually failed after about 2 years of moderate use. Cheap construction and certainly not Apple-quality. You get what you pay for.
0	this cord did not workit broke too quickwaste of money  dont buy it not even worth spending money on it
2	Its so weak it dont charger faster sometimes dont detec the phone its cheap but have a lot of inconvenients
0	I bought three and will need them. They fall apart. The part that goes into the touch falls apart into four pieces and is apparently impossible to get it back together so it charges. I have one that is still together. I will super glue it along the seams so it will last until I order some good chargers.
2	It's ok for what I needed it for. I would buy again if needed to have another. Thanks for your help.
2	I love this little headset it has so much going for it.  I want to give it 5 stars except for one fatal flaw...  Read on.FIRST IMPRESSIONSThe packaging was elegant and the headset immediately fit my ear perfectly with the earpiece that comes with it.  It comes with other earpieces including two sizes of ear hooks.  Pairing it with my iPhone was quick and easy.  The on/off switch is terrific; with myPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging] you don't know if it is on or off you need to just hold in the power button to find out.  The speed at which it connects when turning it on is incredible!  The talk button is easy to find with the finger and use along with the volume buttons.  I wear the headset on my left ear so I have to remember that up volume is the bottom button and vice versa but that's no problem.It comes with a cigarette lighter adapter to a USB port which is great for any USB charging and an AC adapter.LISTENINGI found the audio quality to be decent and it got fairly loud although at highway speeds or in a crowd it can be hard to get it loud enough without smashing it into my ear canal.I would shocked to find that it plays my music podcast audiobooks and most any other audio from the iPhone (called A2DP).  HOW GREAT!!  This is the greatest feature of this headset.  You can be listening to an audiobook while no one notices!  Other headsets in its class are just starting to add this.TALKINGAt first people didn't complain about being able to hear me but upon talking to my doctor he said he could hardly hear me because I sounded like I was in a tunnel.  This started happening more and more.  I tried turning off/on the headset phone; re-pairing but nothing seems to have a lasting effect.  I don't know if this is related to the iPhone itself or if a firmware update could help (I haven't found any available firmware updates as of May 2010).If someone couldn't hear me I would switch over to my Plantronics Voyager 510 and they would tell me how much better they could hear me.I called Jabra support for advice and the gentlemen recommended resetting the headset and then re-pairing to the phone.  Here are the instructions from the Jabra website:It is possible to reset and test the headset by 'pressing and holding' all three buttons at the same time. The red blue and green light will light up in a white light. In this mode the pairing list is reset and you can test if the headset works as you will be able to hear audio in the speaker from the microphone.  The headset will automatically turn off after approx. 10 seconds. The next time you power on the headset will go into pairing mode as the first time you powered your new EXTREME on.While callers could hear me for the first call or two after that it returned to unusable.  This is making me carry two bluetooth headsets; one for audio one for calls...FITIt fits very well although it has fallen out sometimes with bending over or chewing. By adding the ear loop it has a great fit.  Everyone's ears are different so you'll just have to try...BATTERY LIFEI was surprised that I could get a whole day of calls and listening to audio with a device so small!  I have been charging each night.  The standard micro-USB-B connector is fantastic for charging.  I'm so thankful that we're getting away from a unique charger for every piece of electronics.  I bought some micro-USB cables for cheap and can charge at home car or office now.SIZEI love how small it is so that it looks discreet but I am so afraid that I will lose it since it is so small and black.CONCLUSIONSI love this little headset for how small attractive and the A2DP features but the fact that people can't hear and understand me is so disappointing.After pouring over reviews and wanting to find a perfect version of this headset I bought the Aliph Jawbone Icon Series - The Thinker Bluetooth.  Hopefully I'll post a review there soon.  Briefly I found that my voicemail test sounded good; it has an awesome battery-level indicator on the iPhone but there are no volume controls for the Jawbone so I can't adjust A2DP volume levels!  Oh no now I'm going to have to carry three bluetooth headsets!!!
2	When I first got this headset I was really excited because it was sleek looking and promised to be be a great noise reducing headphone. But the more I worked with it the more disappointed I became.One of the things I liked about it was that it came with a nice little charging stand which is good because while I always remember my phone my bluetooth headset gets lost in the clutter and is usually forgotten. Pairing with my Samsung smartphone was a piece of cake.But then came trying to stick it in my ear. The picture shows you a plastic clip to help it stay put in your ear. Unfortunately that clip comes off so easily that I could not get it to stay on and around my ear at the same time. So I figured that it was small enough that if it was properly seated in my ear and I wasn't moving much it would probably work. But then I couldn't figure out how to get the earpiece to settle into my ear. It came with several and I tried all of them but again I guess I just have these freakish ears that are hard to fit.I finally got the best fit I could so came for the moment of truth of actually using it to make a call. The sound quality was ok but not significantly better than other headphones and not better than using my cell phone directly. I went outside where there was more noise and while you could tell there was some noise cancelling it wasn't EXTREME like the name would imply.My biggest complaint though is with the controls. The size of this headset is probably the smallest I have seen which is great because it has a very low dork factor. However the buttons are so small and close together that you are constantly fiddling with it to find the right one. More often than not I just didn't. I suppose if you used it all the time you would get used to it. But I'm unusual in that I really don't use my cell phone that much so I never really got comfortable with it -- though I tried very hard! I used it for over a month.To summarize:Pros:------- very low profile and sleek form factor... virtually no dork factor-- easy to set up and use-- Battery life as good as it comesCons:------- hard to fit in my ears-- clip doesn't stay put making for an insecure fit in your head.-- controls are hard to use because it is so small-- while there is some noise cancelling it is not what I would consider EXTREMEI really wanted to like this headset but it just wasn't a great fit for me.[NCJVR]
2	Pairing my phone with the Jabra was extremely easy.  I like how the unit has a flashing LED to let you know that it is on.  Comfort wise I had no issues and it did not make my ear canal sore after prolonged use.  The noise reduction feature is supposed to be the highlight of this Jabra.  This holds true as the listener on the other end of my calls did not hear much wind or interference.  The main problem was that I could not hear them.  They ended up sounding muffled and even though I had the earpiece volume up at max I still could not distinctly make out what they were saying.  To remedy this I kept having to shove the headset into my ear or cup my hand around it. The big plus is that it charges via a micro USB so if your phone uses that then you can charge your headset with it also.  The unit comes with both a plug-in charger and lighter plug/USB charger.
2	Product worked great for the first couple months since then the uplink audio on mine has deteriorated to the point that people cannot understand me very well even in quiet environments.  My friend also purchased one and is saying his downlink audio will deteriorate while on a call as well as the uplink audio.  I believe the uplink audio issue is due to the noise canceling failing because people have a hard time hearing me while driving where they didn't previously.Even in the first few months when the product was at its best while in a quiet environment I have to cup my hand to channel my voice to the microphone when giving information such as spelling my name or giving numbers for account numbers.  The audio doesn't seem to be very crisp.  Sometimes I just disconnect the bluetooth and use the handset to give these details to which I am told  That sounds much better which isn't what I want to hear after spending $70 on a BT headset.I wouldn't recommend this headset after several months of use as it appears the headset degrades in performance.  This isn't just my experience my friend who bought one at the same time is experiencing the same issues.
2	While the Jabra Extreme Bluetooth headset does a decent job with sound quality standby-time and connectivity it fails for me in a big way when it comes to the charger. If it had a better charger I would likely have rated it with four stars rather than three.The charger is only a foot long. Yes 12 inches. This means it cannot be plugged into an electrical  outlet that isn't next to your desk if you mean to lay it on the desk while charging. In fact I placed a power strip under my coffee table which is considerably lower in height than a desk. I still could not set the headset on top of the coffee table while plugged into the power strip under the table - the cord just does not reach.So unless you want to charge this headset in the bathroom or kitchen where there are outlets at the level of the counter you will have to lay this headset on the floor while charging it. In my home that makes it fair game for a cat to play with. I'm guessing the same may be true of homes with dogs.Sure you could stretch a power strip so it rests on top of a table or desk but this is unsightly and uses precious real estate on that surface all for the sake of a headset that should have been designed better.The second area where Jabra failed on this one is that they only provide a full user manual on their website. When I read this in the manual that came with the device I wasn't overly concerned as I thought it would be no issue to download that manual.That's where I was wrong. The manual is on the website sure but it is not in a standard format that can be downloaded to a PC or Smartphone for use offline. No Jabra only provides the full manual in an interactive online format so you must be connected to the internet and view it on their website. That is all well and good when you have internet available to you but I don't want to have to rely on internet access to look at the product manual. I want to be able to store the PDF on my PC and my smartphone so that I can refer to it any time I need to.The sound quality is decent as I said before. The device seems to have a good stand-by time. I've left it off the charger for days at a time and it still had a charge. I haven't yet run out of charge when talking which is a great indicator that the talk-time is good since I use my cell phone frequently and only with a Bluetooth headset.But the two failures are big enough for me that I can't rate it more than three stars which is generous in my opinion. This is my third experience with a Jabra device and while this headset was better than the first two I owned it just isn't good enough to compete with stellar devices like the Aliph Jawbone series or Plantronics Discovery 925 headset.
2	The Jabra EXTREME Bluetooth Headset is a pretty good Bluetooth earpiece that comes with a surprisingly nice accessory kit for a modest price. The Jabra EXTREME is pretty comfortable in my right ear and usually delivers good reception with my BlackBerry Storm 2 smartphone. That said reception/call quality isn't as reliable as what I've grown to expect from my Plantronics Voyager Pro Bluetooth Headset. The Jabra EXTREME is more comfortable to wear than the Plantronics headset I own but sometimes voices drop out when I use the Jabra and I have to ask people to repeat what they've said.On that note the volume buttons on the Jabra are pretty small and that makes it difficult to adjust the volume while driving without taking your attention off the road. The biggest thing I love about the Jabra EXTREME is the overall kit that comes with it. Not only do you get a typical wall charger but you get a car charger that also doubles as a computer/USB charger. That means you've got three ways to charge the Jabra EXTREME Bluetooth Headset that come FREE with the purchase of the headset! Most of the time you have to pay extra for additional charging methods so that makes the Jabra a better value.If it wasn't for the signal/reception issues and the tiny buttons I'd give this headset 4 or 5 stars out of 5. Again the included accessories are a terrific value it's comfortable and the price of this headset is pretty good. Just be aware that other headsets might provide better call quality/reception and buttons that are easier to use.
0	I have used and own several BT head sets..Motorolas Jabras and Plantronics. My weapon of choice is the Plantronic 510.Large and hearing-aid ish looking but gave great performance until the dog got ahold of it.Introduce the Jabra Extreme.Packaging- very pleasing to the eyes.. it was impressive looking and made me excited to open it.First glance - SMALL.. im talking small enough where i was concerned i might loose it (which is a pro and a con I guess)Headset - small in size and that equated to small buttons (hard for me to use with bigger hands at 6'2 and 225..i DID like the feature of a dedicated slider -on/off switch. i didnt have to sit and wait to hold a button to power it on. the tiny little volume buttons made it hard to find and hard to push when it was on my ear..accessories - only a few atachments offered. It has a HARD and i mean hard rubber ear piece... and THATS IT. no soft gel or cushion option replacement earpiece.there is this tiny paperclip thin HARD plastic piece that slips over your ear to hold it in place and it felt like it was stabbing me behind my ear.the power accessories were nice. i was VERY impressed it came with a USB adaptor plug that could charge in a PC at my work or fit into the car charger it came with. VERY NICE!!fit - uncomfortable at best. while the weight itself was very nice and often i forgot i was wearing it it just didnt fit my ears. and im no dumbo by any means..performance - not so great. sounded muffled when i would call a land line and a cell phone wasnt much better. i have Verizon Wireless in the Washington D.C. metro area (30 min north) so VZW has full service just about all over. it was the headset. if in the middle of a call id switch to my plantronics 510 the problem would resolve itself.despite the nice car charger/usb adaptor and nice look/color of it it just falls short due to the horrible fit/feel of making my ear just hurt after wearing it and the horrible performance during calls.
2	After an extensive search for the best headset for my husband to use in noisy conditions (delivery truck) we finally found the Jawbone Prime which is perfect for him.My situation is more typical I just needed something that would sound decent with regular car background noise for the occasional on-the-road phone call.Not willing to spend another $100+ for the Jawbone I was happy to see this tiny Jabra Extreme.After spending a few weeks with it these are my conclusions:Good:+ Ultra-compact design: fits anywhere.+ Includes car charger: Most require you to purchase this separately. Charger style is also nice and small.+ Real on/off switch: No wondering and waiting to see the light to be sure the unit is powered down.+ Pairs quickly and easily with my Motorola W385 and works with the phone's voice recognition.+ Fits my ear comfortably. I have small ears and the smaller in-ear loop is so comfortable I forget I'm wearing it.+ Sound quality on my end is good and loud enough in the car even at 1/2 volume.Bad:- Microphone requires very loud speaking voice for the other party to hear you.- Tinny annoying-sounding voice quality your poor callers have to deal with.- Didn't fit my husband's ear no matter what configuration he tried.----------In the end no matter how nice the features are on a bluetooth headset it all comes down to what it sounds like - to you and the person you're calling - and this headset fails at both.
2	If you look closely under a lens the tiny writings on the device reveals that this isJabra BT 530 Bluetooth Headsetin disguise.The JABRA Extreme has nice industrial look and blends in well in my ear the sound quality is pretty good and paring was very easy with myNokia 6085 ATT Cell PhoneComes in a display plastic box which is attractive looking but beware that it is hard to get the headset out unless you push a plastic tab see the pictures that I have posted on Amazon to give you an idea of what to expect.The Jabra Extreme has typical features like hands free answering calls of course that is what the headset is supposed to do :-) also ending and rejecting calls voice dialing support last number redial call waiting support placing a call on hold It also has a couple of advanced features like multipoint technology which is the capability to connect the headset with two different devices and A2DP compatibility which allows for streaming music.I have music files on my Nokia 6085 and as soon as the paring is done with the headset the music starts to play automatically. If a call comes in the music is interrupted and I was able to accept calls and once the call is complete the music starts to play back again! - Cool!The call quality is pretty good but on the louder side I tried it in a busy street intersection and I was able to hear things clearly the others reported that my voice is coming thru' loud and clear. The usage of Jabra in my old noisy car proved good use of the noise cancellation technology Even though the caller on the other side was able to distinguish that I was taking inside my car they had no problem in hearing my voice - Good!PROS:[+] Nice looking tiny Bluetooth headset[+] Car Charger included which is a bonus![+] Very good noise isolation[+] Mono Music streaming is possible.[+] Dedicated ON/OFF switch to save battery![+] Comparatively cheaper with loaded featuresCONS:[-] Volume is too loud even when turned down to minimum[-] Music quality is not that great
0	No body could hear me or understand what I was saying.  That is using the Jabra in my office at home with no background noise.  It went right back to Amazon.  Save for time and money.  I like the Plantronics Margue 2. Crystal clear on both ends
2	Jabra Extreme is very low profile and good looking headset with some great qualities strongest being very good noise cancellation. I tried it with iPod Touch 2G iMac & Motorola Droid. It's PROS & CONS are as follows.PROS1. Excellent noise suppression: the party at other end could not hear loud blaring music or wind noise.2. Low profile.3. Nice finish and construction quality.4. Good ergonomics with well placed controls.5. Can pair 8 devices to this headset and connects to 2 simultaneously.6. Very clear sound.7. Easy to pair: I paired with Motorola Droid iPod Touch 2G and iMac without any hitch.8. Ubiquitous mini USB charger and the headset comes with both car and wall charger.9. Automatic adjustment of volume.10. Comes with two ear gels (one for each ear) and ear hooks.11. Long lasting battery charge.12. Range of about 20 feet.13. You can receive and reject calls. I have not tried voice dialing.14. Works flawlessly with Skype on iMac (but not on iPod Touch).15. Comes with wall and car charger although micro USB cable is very short. But retractable micro USB cables are not very expensiveAmzer Micro USB Retractable Data Cable (Black).CONS1.  Sometimes it does not connect automatically on turning it on with Droid or iPod Touch and I have to go into Bluetooth settings to establish the connection. This happens about 20-30% of time and for me is the biggest glitch in this headset.2.  Relatively expensive because you can get Bluetooth headsetsMotorola H270 Bluetooth HeadsetandMotorol H500 Bluetooth Headset (Silver) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging] for about twenty bucks. And you can get stereo New Samsung  WEP870 Mono + Stereo BT Headset for thirty five bucks.3.  Cannot fast forward or skip music tracks. This headset is made mainly for the cell phones. Although you can use it with MP3 players like iPod touch it lacks the music navigation capabilities found in many stereo A2DP headsets/headphones.4. Takes a minute or two to fit it in the ear but very comfortable once it is placed. After a while you forget that you are wearing headset.5. Comes with big clear plastic storage box what is needed is really a small pocketable storage bag.6. There are some other glitches and I am not sure who is at fault there the headsets or the gadget or app software. For example it works great with Motorola Droid phone part but not the Music app that comes with the phone an app called Recorder (just the microphone) and sometimes not even with Listen the Google podcast app. Similarly with iPod Touch: works fabulously with music and podcasts but the Jabra Extreme microphone does not work with Skype & Recorder apps. So far I have been unsuccessful in fixing these snags by playing around with settings.7. The earhooks keep falling off and are easy to loose. A pack extra gels and hooks is avilable only at the JABRA website for ten bucks with ten buck shipping!Except for these glitches this is one of the best Bluetooth headsets I have used when it comes to noise cancellation. Although there are other less expensive Blutooth headsets I am not sure if they have such good noise suppression and clarity of sound that thisJabra EXTREME Bluetooth Headsethas.
2	There are some things I really like about this bluetooth headset but unfortunately there are also some things I don't like.First the good.  It is fairly comfortable and comes with two sizes of ear loops.  I had to replace the smaller loop with the larger loop and then it fit quite well.  There is also an option to just stick it directly in your ear with no loop but I did not try that option.  I previously had a larger Motorola headset and I like the smaller size of this Jabra.One of my complaints with the Motorola was that it was too hard to hear even with the volume at max.  This one has a much better speaker and I found both the volume and quality of the sound from the other person to be excellent.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the quality of my voice to the other person but I'll get to that.I also liked that it was very easy to pair with my iPhone as the headset goes into automatic-pairing mode the first time you turn it on.  You just ask the iPhone to find it and voila!When you first put this headset on and start using it it seems fantastic.But then I did a test of my voice quality by leaving myself several voice mail messages and then playing them back.  I like doing this since it lets me hear my voice from the headset immediately after my voice from the greeting so it's easy to compare.  This test failed miserably.  Even though I was speaking loudly into the headset my voice played back to me sounded like I was in a room speaking into a speaker phone and far away from that speaker phone.  It was tinny and hard to hear.  If the caller on the other end doesn't have good volume on his/her end he/she may not be able to hear you.  On the other hand it's not much worse than speaking into a Bluetooth hands free car kit but I expect better from an ear-mounted unit than from my car's built-in mic.My other complaints are minor compared to the quality and volume of how other callers hear me.First the length of the included power cord is quite humorous.  To give you an idea of how short it is I plugged it into a household wall outlet and the cord is so short that the headset doesn't even hit the floor when hanging down from the outlet!  Imagine if you need to charge this via an outlet in a typical office you will have to have the headset dangling from an outlet under your desk!  Hopefully you have an outlet up on our desk.The good news however is that it includes a USB adapter so you can simply charge it from your computer instead.  Still I got a laugh out of the world's shortest power cord.  Not sure what they were thinking.If you care about the environment you will be alarmed at the product's packaging.  It is irresponsibly packaged inside a large clear hard-plastic case that will never break down.  When you buy this headset you are sticking a large plastic casing into a landfill.  I had no idea that companies were still using this type of packaging in the 21st century.Bottom line is I still haven't found a Bluetooth headset that provides as good of quality as using the iPhone's wired earbuds.  And that's a shame since it would be great to ditch the wires.This one provides you with good audio but not the other way around to your caller.
2	Nice and sleek but a bit slippery. I would not buy it again but then I am very hard to please.
2	What I really didn't like about this case was 1) the way it recesses the controls so they are harder to push and 2) the difficulty with which the case goes on and off the phone. I prefer the Elago case -- easier controls and easier to put on and remove but not as much protection as this. Very thin cases such as this and the Elago are for keeping a good grip on a slippery phone not protecting it in a fall.
2	I knew before I purchased this that the SHIELD case wouldn't provide much protection for the front of the phone but I didn't realize how much of the front silver lining of the phone was left uncovered. I changed my case from the iCase Slider to this in the morning and five hours later I tripped with my phone in my hand and scratched up the bottom corner of the phone. There's a big scratch along the edge of my phone now because the SHIELD left so much unprotected and unfortunately my sleek new iPhone is now a scratched up iPhone.I guess for the much more careful this is a fine case to buy. It covers most of the back and provides a firmer grasp on the phone when you're using it. For me it always feels like the phone is going to slip right out of my hand when I don't have a case or cover on it so this was a good case in that aspect since it doesn't add any bulk. However don't count on much protection for your phone even on the back where the Apple logo is exposed -- one wrong move with your car keys in your purse or pocket and you'll end up with a big scratch along the back too.I've since changed my case out to something with more coverage and I'm happier using that instead.

2	I loved this dock for the Bold at first. Worked great.  Very handy way to charge without plugging and unplugging. Moreover a handy feature (controlled by options you can choose on the phone settings) can automatically shift the Bold to clock mode when it is charging.  So you drop it in the dock and it become your night clock. Great.My problem is simple: after a couple of months it stopped working reliably. I put it in the dock but the phone does not charge. Or it does charge but then twenty minutes later it stops.  Easy to tell because if it is not charging it also does not shift into clock mode. So it sits in the pod not charging. And because it isn't in clock mode it will ring if someone calls not what you probably want in the middle of the night (especially if you are traveling and your caller does not realize the time zone you are in).  Somehow or another the phone stopped connecting reliably to the dock.I am still using it but instead of leaving the charger connected to the docking station I plug and unplug the charger's cord from the phone itself each time and use the docking station as just a stand. Still kind of works but not the way it is supposed to and not so handy.  A disappointment.Perhaps I just got a bad one as I don't notice this complaint from others.UPDATE:  The problem was the phone not the charging pod.  I replaced the phone on warranty on another issue and discovered that the new phone charged just fine in this pod.  I would now rate the pod five stars.
0	Well it's consistent.The stock cable that came with my BlackBerry is a micro-USB on the BB end.  The base needs a mini-USB connection.  So that didn't fit.But then my BBBold didn't fit either; it wasn't at all secure and it looked like the charging nibs would have had a dead short through the metallic band around the rim of the case ... so perhaps it's just as well I didn't have a cable.Anyway it's going back immediately.
0	The description was incorrect and the product  did not match my device.
0	I thought this was for the 9900.  I ordered the wrong product.  This was my error not the error of the company or product...
2	It does the job I guess we will have to see how long it lasts.  It was a good product for the price.
0	Storm comes with  a screen protector already. Unless you want to replace the orginal bubble-free protector with your own there is no need to buy this.
0	This battery looks just like the photo and says it is a RIM Blackberry but it will not hold a charge.  Fully charged it does not even last eight hours. This battery was made in China the ones that seem to work better are made in Japan.  The battery I am replacing was made in Japan and after years of useit is actually still better than this new made in China battery.  It's not worth any amount of money - don't buy it.
2	For the price it serves the purpose.  Will last a day with little usage.  Needed a battery for on non-used blackberry for traveling overseas.  I give it 5 starts for working but take away 2 for amount of time it holds a charge.  For this price you could buy a couple.
2	First impression that you get is worth a thousand words right? So when the package the battery comes in says BlackBerry Standard Battery 9000 Bold New--- I think that means new not almost new not a take out new not sorta new not it was new at some point in its life new... but NEW. With that said the contacts are dirtier than my original 3-year old battery the case is scratched like someone played hockey with it and every other battery I have ever purchased was semi charged when I got it--- this one was not. The charge state of the battery does not bother me the other definitely does.The only thing they have going for them so far was that it shipped quickly and I got it when I was supposed to. As far as the actual product that will either take it down to 1-star if it turns out to be a used and bad battery that will go back to them for a full refund or remain at 3-starts if it works like new. I can't go higher than 3-stars as right out of the gate as it was not clean and shiny new as it should have been.This is the third smartphone battery that I have bought on Amazon and the first one that was not as it was supposed to be. My reviews are usually positive and as long as it works as it is supposed to I give it full credit. I should know by Christmas if it is good or bad as I heavily use my Blackberry and know exactly how it is supposed to react.Jan 2012 update. After using it for a number of days even though the case looks like it is well used it does work much better than my last battery. So for this one--- 3-start it will stay and it should carry me over until I get my new Blackberry in the coming months.
0	bad battery is ded when it reached mei again i should call and get one morei recomand dont buy BlackBerry Standard Battery 9000 Bold
2	Great idea but very low quailty.  Lasted about three months and the clip that holds the phone in place broke rendering it useless.
2	I got this case because Seidio makes awesome blackberry cases.  It's thin it's light it doesn't get in the way.  I also got the belt clip because I like not putting my phone in my pocket.  The problem with this case is that for some reason it was designed to go face-in only.  Now when I get my email I have to pry my phone out of my clip and check my email and then awkwardly put it back in the clip.  It's not an elegant solution.I know the face-in is supposed to protect your screen etc. but what's the point of that if it renders your phone completely unusable?  It should have been designed to go in either way.  It sucks that I dropped [...] on 3 of them - only to go back to the flimsier griffin clip with no protective shell.
0	The spring clip broke after 40 days of use. Can't even return it since it's 10 days past the 30 day Amazon return policy. Yes Seido will ship a replacement for free. But this doesn't address the design flaw - the spring clip attachment is so brittle that it will break again after a few weeks. I've been using holsters like these since 2000 - from the original Palm Treo to the Blackberry to the iPhone. This is the first holster I've used where the the design itself is flawed. Save your $30 and get another one.
2	Works and looks great. However if you have any type of screen protector on your phone you might as well take it off because putting this case on will peel it right off the case is that tight otherwise great design.
2	They put all their effort into creating a phone (without a mouthpiece) and added a really cheap headset onto it. If you want a lot of dialing features to carry around the house with you (caller ID auto dialing etc) then the phone part of this is okay (my portable phones all do these things and are only a bit heavier). But I wanted really good sound and this doesn't have it. It has one of those mikes that doesn't make it all the way to your mouth and the volume control is in the phone with only 3 levels - not enough to help.I followed another reviewer's idea and called into my voicemail from this phone and from several others in the same call. Then I listened on different phones. This one is slightly better than the $20 headset I was trying to replace but worlds worse than just talking into a regular phone. Not worth $100!
0	I got a CT12 (unless it was a CT10) back in 2000.  I loved it: it saved my neck from the pain associated with tilting my neck to hold a phone between my shoulder and my ear.  The sound quality was great.  The phone worked whether docked in its charger or while roaming the house.  The sound quality was exceptional.  the only problem I ever had with it was that I dropped it all the time and finally after years of abuse I killed it.  (In fact I had two of these phones between 2000 and 2010 when I finally decided I couldn't squeeze anymore life out of the second one also a victim of falls.)  Compared to the older models this CT14 is a terrible disappointment.  I'm using it in the same location yet now there is a constant irritating sound in the background.  And it cannot be used while docked in the charger.  May not sound like a big issue.  But to answer these phones one has to get the headset on then press the talk button before the call goes to voicemail.  With the old model those were the only steps.  With the CT14 there is a 3rd step -- pull the phone out of the charger get the headset on then press talk.  It's not so easy to do that quickly especially when the headset plug can pull out of the phone quite easily.  Also if you're using the phone and inadvertently put it back in the charger because you're using it while sitting at the desk where the charger is the phone disconnects the call.  If it does this because of some danger of the phone blowing up or giving me cancer while in use and in the charger I'd be interested to know.  Otherwise it just seems like a design flaw.  My rating of this phone is particularly low because I loved the older model so much.  It was a revalation.  This one is terrible by comparison.  (If you never had the older version this one might not frustrate you as much as it does me.  But really I am not okay with the terrible sound quality.)
2	Good Stuff+ The phone itself has all the typical features I need+ The battery is NiMh so less memory effects and less environmentally unsafe than NiCad+ The unit is small and very light+ The headset sits on top of the antenna when not in use and I think that's pretty coolBad Stuff- The audio quality is just ok. It's not as good as my regular old cordless handset that has jack for a headset- Buttons are small- Build quality seems to be pretty flimsyI think it comes down to value. The Plantronics Cordless Headset Phone (CT14) does what it's supposed to but at almost $100 it doesn't offer any compelling features and may in fact provide fewer features and poorer quality at a higher price than a good cordless handset and a headset (purchase separately).
0	There is a low-grade static buzz sound that one hear almost always. This is not audible to others but significantly diminshes the usability of this product. This item is also corded another significant hamstring. 1 star - unusable unsatisfactory quality and poor technology.
0	I use this in my home office and it's done the job so far. A little staticky in places but I haven't isolated if that is the phone Vonage or  the conference service I use.Setup was straight forward and setting the time and date are easy. I haven't used to many other options on the phone except mute and conference and both are easy enough. The headset is flimsy and cheap feeling especially if your used to Plantronics quality but it does it's job and the sound quality is good.Overall a nice travel phone that stays out of the way.Update - June 23rd - More than one year later it's breaking.Close to one year later. I reduced this to one star because after daily typical office only use the headphone is starting to crackle and drop audio. It seems the connection into the carry on base unit is somehow dropping the connection which makes this essentially useless. This carries a one year warranty so this is just past the point of help. It was very rare for me to actually take the headphone out of the base which could have caused some connection issues so I'm not certain how it lost it's audio.
2	Very nice soft leather case big so you can have a case on your phone only thing is it slip off easy from your belt. They need to work on that.
2	gave it has a birthday present they really enjoyed it fits most of the their phone easy to carry thanks
2	Its an ok case but without any belt loops the whole case slides off your belt when trying to remove the phone from the case.If it had a way to stay on your belt I would rate it 4 stars before seeing how long it would last.I've had some no name brand cases last days and some last years...I gave this away to a friend who had a thinner phone - hopefully it lasts him a long time.
2	This case would work best for those who have a larger case such as an Otterbox on their phone.  With a TPU or silicone skin only there is enough room for a second phone.  The magnet closure is not very strong and I'm afraid that if the case were to fall off my belt/waistband that the weight of the phone will cause it to fall out.  Other than that the quality of the case is okay and does provide reasonable protection for a phone.
2	[Update]After giving it great reviews i'm gonna have to retract my earlier comments (see below). I have never dropped or abused the case but now i have three cracks (two of which have cut all the way through making the plastic come apart) at the top of the case one near the headphone jack and one near the on/off button. I really liked the case but i guess it's not built to last. My best guess as to how it happened is that over time when you take the phone out of your pocket or something similar the plastic catches and it stresses the case. Once you get a crack (i had the crack near the on/off button first) it's just a matter of time before you get another one as the crack will open the case up to getting caught on something more often. It's not possible to fix with adhesives (i tried); it may appear to be holding but because the case is so tight when you put it on the phone the fixed crack will open up again during the process.It's really too bad... i was really hoping it would last longer.---If you're looking for a case that will protect against scratches from everyday use (putting the phone on the table for example) this is the case to get. It's light sturdy and has got a nice feel with minimalist design so it's not changing the look of the phone. If you're a total clutz and need a case that will protect against multiple drops and you're the type who doesn't know whether the phone is up or facing down when you set it down on hard surfaces this is not the case for you. In fact any case that can take that kind of abuse will not look nice on ANY phone so you should curb your expectations in that regard.As with ANY case you're gonna get discoloration and wear over time so to minimize this effect i would suggest getting darker color cases - and stay away from any shiny or clear finishes. I got the flat black colored case and scratches are not noticeable and i can use my phone without having to worry about whether i'm gonna scratch the case badly or not. After all they're meant to take the scratches so i don't understand people that complain about why protective cases get scratched up.Anyways product is solid. It also comes with a protective film - i would recommend watching instructional videos on youtube on how to apply them as you only get one try with this package (i messed up and had to get another poorer film product). The protective film seemed to be of good quality also.
2	UPDATE2- apparently there's no way to differentiate (or link) product reviews on Amazon to a particular seller (or a particular batch of product). So as I mentioned in my original review Incipio Feather case is great (or I wouldn't be buying it again!). However the case I bought recently from a particular seller/batch on Amazon has a peeling issue- clearly a lemon. I'm revising my rating to 3 stars as the case is otherwise great (deserves 5 stars actually if not for manufacturing quality control issues). This is the thinnest slimmest lightest whatever-estest case I've ever seen for the iPhone- it's almost not there while protecting your iPhone (and I've dropped mine plenty !)The replacement I bought at Tekserv is still on my iPhone 5 months later and has no issues whatsoever.UPDATE- I just browsed through other reviews and clearly I'm not the first one to notice the coating peeling off.ORIGINAL REVIEW-I had one of these cases which cracked so I bought a replacement from Amazon. The one I received from Amazon looked almost identical to my old case but has major quality issues- the matte finish coating started peeling off almost instantly. In fact it peels off by simply scratching the case with a fingernail revealing a glossy plastic base.Which leads me to believe it's either-1. A manufacturing defect affecting only a certain batch of these cases2. A knock-off case of inferior quality (I did notice a slight difference in the typeface of the word Incipio on the case between my old case and the one I ordered on Amazon- go figure)I went to Tekserv in Manhattan today and bought yet another one of these (I bought my first case there as well)- it has no issues and the coating is scratch-resistant
2	I liked the idea of a light case for my iPhone but unfortunately this case not only broke but the outer pair coating began to chip within days of purchase. I guess I'll deal with bulkier cases!
2	This is a nice thin case and mostly I like it. When I get another one I'll get a darker color.Pros:1. It's very thin. When I want extra protection I put my iphone incipio case and all into a Belkin leather flip caseBelkin Leather Flip Case for iPhone 3G 3G S (Black)2. It adds a nice rubberized grip to the phone. I feel I'm less likely to drop the phone and that it'll be a bit protected if/when I do.3. The color is interesting and unusual.Cons:1. I can't figure out how to clean it. It's picked up a lot of dark smudges and looks like crud but neither soap and water nor 409 will remove the smudges. (Hmmm. And I just got a little more aggressive since the case is sort of ruined to me anyway at this point and tried isopropyl alcohol and even nail polish remover and no luck.)2. I agree with others that the color is not as vivid as I see on assorted monitors. I think of the color of the one I got as dark turquoise. It's greener and grayer than the picture I see here. It's an unusual color but a bit ho-hum as compared with what I thought it would be.I haven't had any problems peeling.I do plan to buy an incipio featherweight case again but a darker color because of the smudges. (And also because this one just doesn't have the zing I was expecting.)
2	This is good looking case and when I read reviews elsewhere that most people that work at Apple use this case for their iPhone I was sold.The case is feather light and thin which is the best feature.  It fits around your iPhone as if no cover was there.  Also it has a rubber-like feel to it so when you hold the case it's not slippery which is another bonus.  Again no complaints on looks.One flaw is that the case doesn't cover all the chrome around the iPhone.  Therefore you'll still end up with scratches all around the front chrome part.Perhaps the biggest flaw with this case is that it is too delicate/flimsy/fragile.  Call it what you want but if you even drop your phone once the case WILL CRACK.  Yes you don't want to drop your phone but really isn't that what a case is for?  To protect against damage correct?  Well unless you put your phone in another case i.e. a leather one then you're bound to have some wear and tear on your phone so be warned that this case will not hold up.  Mine is in bad shape after just 2 months and I dropped it once on a counter - not even on the floor - when the phone slipped out of my hands and it cracked the case in two places.  Now I have to look for another cover which is too bad since this one cost me $20!
2	I was one of those that tried to purchase on launch day but had to order and received it bout 5 days later.  This is my first time owning a Blackberry and purchased it for $100 including rebates and plus I was an existing customer.  I was pretty disappointed with this phone but ended keeping any ways.  I had a LG Voyager and loved it and waiting for the new one to come out and I will jump ship as soon as the new one comes out.  I updated the new software but still the same.  All I can Say is even though all the experts are saying the Iphone is better.  I will never ever buy anything from Apple cause I just think their products are garbage.  I still can't believe the new 3G Iphone still does not support music streaming and the Itunes software is trash.  Well enough bout my babbling on the piece of crap Apple products. I just hope RIM fixes all the bugs or they'll lose many customers.
2	If this phone worked as it should it would be acceptable at best but a number of software problems make it something you will probably want to avoid.The email feature is very good although it only checks for email from most ISP servers every 15 minutes and there is no way to force it check for new mail at your convenience. To get around this you must have all your email forwarded to a service like Hotmail or Yahoo which means you will get copies of your email immediately. However if you want to reply you will not be able to change your reply-from account from Hotmail to your main ISP email provider. You'll have to wait 15 minutes until the original email comes through.When you are in a call the screen goes dark quickly and it requires a lot of maneuvering to get a keyboard up if you have to press keys during your call or even if you want to switch to speaker phone mode.Trying to type an email or text takes real perseverance. The default Sure Type mode that suggests words is cumbersome and changing its suggestions can be maddening. Even in landscape mode with a QWERTY keyboard an auto-correct feature takes over and requires constant vigilance. And just TRY to use the touch-and-click screen to reposition the insertion point and make a correction several letters or words back; it's really frustrating.The manual that comes with the phone and the various online tutorials don't begin to cover what you need to know to use the phone's features; you will need to attend a Verizon workshop.All of the above assumes that phone actually works as it's supposed to. After spending hours with Verizon and BlackBerry support staff I finally got the phone to the point where it works much of the time which is a giant step up from the way the phone came out of the box.Here are some of the problems all of which BlackBerry acknowledges as known issues and which Verizon will tell you SHOULD be addressed in a long-promised and long-overdue software upgrade (think Windows Vista):* Voice-command dialing (e.g. via Bluetooth headset) sometimes results in a white screen that locks up your phone and requires one or more reboots (a reboot means removing the battery for 15 seconds replacing it and waiting 4 to 6 minutes until you can use the phone again).* The battery drains quickly and sometimes continues to drain when plugged into a charger; it may require one or more reboots to start charging.* Synching the Storm with Outlook can result in errors that prevent this feature from working until you spend many hours with support staff trying to find which record causes the problem; the fix will last a couple of days before the problem recurs.* The network connection turns itself off occasionally and you won't be able to make or receive calls until you notice that the network is off and you go into the options to turn it back on.In order to get around the Bluetooth lock-ups I purchased aBlackBerry HS-655+ Bluetooth Headset which the manual recommends. It has cut down on but not eliminated the number of lock-ups.The most helpful support person was a Verizon tech who had me wipe the phone and start over (choose the Options button then Security Options then General Settings then press the menu button and choose Wipe Handheld; all the software reloads automatically but you will have to reload any personal data). That helped with most of the problems including the Outlook synch problem which hasn't recurred (it's been 10 days).
2	I wanted to love this phone but having a screen that clicks just was not a good design.  The mere fact that you have to press then let go to register a click makes it inherently slow. Plus you cant type without making a lot of racket like during a business meeting or at the movies.  Maybe RIM should give you the option to turn clicking off so u can use it like any old touch screen.The device actually has gaps between the screen and the rest of the body allowing dust and dirt to get into your phone!  On some on the shipped storms clicks were not registering on the outer edges of the screen necessitating uses to stuff paper etc. in the battery compartment to make the storm work correctly.  Are u friggin kidding me? lolThe worse part of typing is actually the keyboard software itself.  Try typing any combination of numbers and letters and you are in for an experience.  Too many button presses are required to alternate between numbers and letters.  Touch screen keyboards have been around for ever.  You'd think RIM would give you something new that works well.  The storm landscape keyboard isn't as good as my old win mobile on screen keyboard from years ago.If you are use to bb's with a trackball you are going to find navigating the storm a pain.  Try scrolling any long page.  It takes forever.  Maybe they will put a trackball on the next storm or at least give u accelerated flicking like u see in the iphone.I wont even mention the slow camera check error random reboots slow accelerometer bad browser etc since those things may get fixed if they haven't been already.  Just dont expect to be able to run lots of apps like you see on the iphone.  It's simply not going to happen.I'll be using the bb curve until verizon release the bb storm or the palm pre.
2	This phone case was bought for my teenager who drops her phone all the time and this one was bought to replace another she said its working good so far though
2	There are good and bad things about the Blackberry Storm.  If you're reading this chances are you've already researched this phone a bit and you've probably read other reviews.  Obvious comparisons are abound about the Storm vs. the iPhone.  The Storm is a well built phone but the interface just doesn't compare.Pros:Organizing your life with the Storm is easy.  The calender alarm notes and navigation are a little tough to learn at first but are easily mastered.  If you have used a Blackberry before you'll have no trouble picking this up and going on your way.  Hey this is the main feature of a Blackberry...right?The build of the phone is nice and sturdy.  You don't have to worry about breaking this when you throw it in your pocket.Micro USB standard charger - this means a lot of your electronics will use the same charger.The internet is fast if you can deal with the touch screen.Jim Halpert is featured on the commercials!  Big tuna.Cons:I've used the iPhone and the LG Dare so I know touch screen phones.  The Storm is a nightmare to text on.The touch screen clicking takes a bit to get used to.  I didn't like it although I'm sure some will.  When I highlight an application I expect it to open...I don't expect to have to highlight something THEN click it again.No built in internal memory - you'll need to pick up a micro SD card if you want to put videos or music on there.The screen isn't as impressive looking as either it's touch screen counterpart the iPhone or it's AT&T; brother the Bold.The bottom line is - if you can get used to the touch screen this will be a fine phone for you.  I didn't like the touch screen so most of the features didn't do what I needed them to.  This phone is just too young - wait for the next version.
0	I got this phone thinking it would be a lot better than it was. It is so annoyingly slow. It has lots of bugs and drives me crazy. Nearly every day I want to beat it with my hammer. I would rather have one of those old brick phones than this piece of junk. Don't waste your money!!!
2	BlackBerry Storm is like a beautiful woman with a personality disorder: It will charm you with its gorgeous screen but make your life difficult with slow & buggy software that constantly freezes! Like you have an urgent call to make and phone is locked up for 2 minutes!BlackBerry Storm has hung up 3 times in one week that I have had it compared to my previous Palm Treo 755p which did that only twice in last one year. Once it freezes you have to remove the cover  take the battery out and put it back in and then it takes 2-3 minutes to boot up. Buggy & sluggish software feels like Windows Mobile rather than Palm or iPhone.Pros:1.Beautiful high resolution screen2.Very Good email device3.Great Verizon coverage and better voice compared to other networks.4.Fast 3G compared to iPhone although browser is not as good.5. Bluetooth modem tethers and works well but I got download speed of 198 Kbs compared to 700-900 Kbs that I used to get with Treo 755p through the cable.Cons:1.Half baked software that freezes a lot.2.Very sluggish software takes a while to respond - compared to Treo 755p & iPhone.3.User interface nowhere close to user friendliness and slickness of iPhone or Palm Treo 755p. You have to go through several menus and taps to do simple things for example you have to go through two screens and taps to put phone in vibrate mode.4.Voice quality inferior than Palm Treo 755p but better than iPhone.5.Poor desktop sync software. On Mac it either syncs contacts & calendar with PocketMac; or the media with iTunes with MediaSync- not both. And once you install MediaSync you cannot use PocketMac!6.Only syncs playlists not Podcasts.7.Unable to play audiobooks from Audible.com as of February 2009.8.Does not fast forward or reverse audio or video.9.Long shutter lag with camera and even though it is supposed to be 3.2 megapixel picture quality is not very good.10.No Wi-Fi.11.Fairly heavy at 155 gm and not easily pocketable like Palm Centro.12.Bluetooth plays stereo but constantly disconnects.13. Accelerometer very sensitive keeps changing keyboard from portrait to landscape and vice versa even when you do not want to.BlackBerry Storm replaced my Palm Treo 755p which I really liked except for its bulk browser and lack of Wi-Fi. I was hoping to replace  2 devices - Treo 755p &  iPod - with Storm but its software is buggy & sluggish and voice quality poor compared to Palm Treo 755p; and media player does not sync Podcasts and play as well as iPod.  After using BlackBerry Storm for 2 weeks I returned it in my 30 day trial period and replaced it with a snappy Palm Centro that responds instantly to pressing the button. And now using Storm seems like a bad nightmare!
0	I anxiously awaited this phone for a couple months the day finally came and the phone arrived and what a disappointment it was!I spent about a week trying to get used to the feel of the phone i really gave it every effort but the phone just didn't work the way it should have.  I know there have been software releases to make the phone work the way it was intended but I just didn't have the time to invest in it.I'll make this short and to the point if you're a business/power email user then this phone will cramp your style try it out for a week or two and you will see.  Numerous times buttons on the screen were accidentally touched and the camera would come on and different things would activate.The screen rotation system was horrible with a 3-5 second delay from landscape to portrait mode not to mention the phone is just awfully slow.And keep in mind this wasn't just my phone i ordered over 5 of these and everyone complained about the same thing all were sent back.  Even now a few weeks after the release people that have them still seem disappointed but are stuck with them.This would make a great phone for your teenager still in school but if you use a BlackBerry to make deals happen and to manage your day then this phone is a sad disappointment!!
0	I am going to keep this short since I'm about to go to the Verizon store to replace the Storm (aptly named) with a Curve.  This phone is a disaster.  Very buggy which while the bugs can be fixed with upgrades will never fix the really (for me at least) difficult to use touchscreen keyboard.  The problem is that it is nearly impossible not to touch a nearby key on the keyboard and that slows one down considerably.  I've tried I really wanted this phone to be great given all the features but can't stand it.  Also if you want to use the keyboard you have to go to menu scroll down (should be a top menu choice) and then select Show keyboard.  That's an annoyance after being used to having a keyboard (a real one) right on the device.  When entering information into a field on a webpage the keyboard does automatically come up.  But you have to tap exactly into the field data entry box on the page (good luck in doing that; you can magnify the page but then have to demagnify the page to view it after entering your text).  Just too user unfriendly and an enormous missed opportunity by RIM to create something great.
2	There is nothing wrong with the service or the provider but the magnets in this phone will ruin your compas in the phone. I heard it from other people and I didn't know if it was true so if you're the same way try this.. Go to google maps and turn on street view with compas mode. hold the case up to the phone and it will change the direction drastically. The service was awesome. great delivery but since I already purchased it I cut a small slit under all of the magnets and I took them out. I put a small button on it that I got from walmart with some super glue.
2	The case itself is a great fit for a G1.  The magnets do a good job holding the flap securely closed and it doesn't look bad on the hip.The design of the cover for the belt clip however doesn't appear to have been well thought out.  Constantly being pulled and re-clipped to my belt after a couple of weeks the stitching holding the leather covering over the metal belt clip gave way thus leaving an exposed sharp metal clip.  It's not dangerously sharp but it will let you know if you say accidentally clip it to your pants rather than the belt.  I have been looking for a replacement holster ever since and a soon as I find one that will fit my G1 that *doesn't* have this issue I'll be dumping this for something a little less pokey.
2	Nice case but it is built way too tight to fit smartphone with a sturdy rubberized protective shells only accepts phone with extremely thin cosmetic only shells.
2	Good:-1. So so sliding keyboard though not nearly as large and useful as touch pro2!2. A 3.5 jack for standard earphones! Reason that I bought this phone!3. Smaller and lighter size than the huge HTC Touch Pro2 and HTC HD24. Love the panels! Especially the clock panel with so many apps that I use such as WiFi5. Windows 6.1 Pro (this is my 6th WinMo device)6. Easy to set up WiFi and has both IE and Opera browsers.7) Google Search screen in the front.Bad:-1. Resistive touch screen meaning you still need a stylus most of the time. (I use my long nails as a stylus).2. Tiny onscreen QWERTY Keyboard for a person  that has tiny tiny tiny fingers!3. It said it accepts up to a 16g SD card and yes it reads the card but when you have a 16g card in the phone the phone will NOT open Mobile Office! Had to take out the 16 g and place a 8g in the phone then Windows Mobile Office worked.4. Comparing it with HTC Touch Pro2 the Touch Pro2 WINS except the TouchPro2 does not have a3.5 jack and the Pro is so bulky and heavy!I am rating first the PRO Stars that I give to this phone below:1) A 3.5 Jack  - 1 Star2) FM Radio - 1 Star3) WiFi - 1 Star4) Windows Mobile - 1 Star5) Compact Size and lightweight - 1 Star6) Easy to use panels (especially the clock panel with weather and other apps - 1 star)The CON Stars I took off are shown below:1) Will not hold a 16g SD Card and open Mobile Office at the same time - minus 1 star!2) Stiff hardware keyboard and horrible onscreen tiny QWERTY both very cramped - minus 1.5 stars!TOTAL RATING I GIVE THIS PHONE IS: 3.5 Stars
2	I got this as a replacement to my ATT Tilt. I also have a Sony W880i which I really like. I picked this one up for slightly below $600. While the build quality on this phone is fantastic compared to the ATT Tilt in all other respects it is almost identical to the Tilt albeit with a much better screen.I also have an itouch and I have to say the itouch multimedia capabilities really blows my Xperia out of the water! I am mentioning the itouch here since I guess that is what the iphone must be like as well.The problem here is the Windows mobile OS which has a terrible touch screen interface. Also my phone requires rebooting on a daily basis especially if I browse the web.Overall there is nothing wrong with this phone. If you're looking for a great Windows Mobile phone this is probably the best. However with other smart phone choices such as Blackberry Nokia and iphone I am not sure the OS here holds up to the competition. This phone like my Tilt has great stats on paper but the implementation is what really matters and that is where Microsoft has let the product down.Just to be clear I am not a Sony or MSFT basher. I love most of my sony products - and I own a lot of them but this isn't really worth it to me and I would not recommend this to anyone who is willing to look at a non MSFT Smartphone OS.
0	Easy to Google for benchmarks and details as with the Tilt this is another HTC/Qualcomm device with well-documented inferior multimedia capabilities compared to other (Samsung LG Toshiba Apple Nokia) devices.  Current Qualcomm cpus have been well-documented to be slower than even circa 2002-2003 PocketPC devices when it comes to multimedia.  It's unfortunate a class-action law suite hasn't panned out.Even with the poorly received CLIE NX/UX keyboards Sony hasn't improved their design.It also doesn't help that this device was delivered with cracks in the casing so the whole first-batch of the US launch was recalled.  Now what was a Nov 28 2008 launch has been back-ordered until January 2009.
2	Here is a review of the Xperia X1. I have owned the X1 HTC Touch Pro2 HTC HD2 Nokia E90 Nokia E72 Nokia N95 and Apple iPhone. Other than the iPhone I really hate this phone.1) Build Quality - the plastic on this phone peeled off everywhere! The finishing on this phone is very susceptible to friction. The plastic chrome will peel off. The paint on the metal battery cover will scratch or peel off. The internal housing will crack. It's like the device had an earthquake and cracked itself. I didn't even sit on the device or drop it on anything. There is no way to prevent the plastic from cracking and peeling. All of this happened within 6 months.The keyboard will also loose sensitivity. Over time you will have to press on the keys harder and harder when you want to type something. The keyboard will only satisfy you for a year. And on top of that the keyboard sucks. Don't even think about speed typing on this bad boy.2) Efficiency - the phone is very inefficient. The terrible feedback on the keyboard forces me to use the virtual keyboard on the phone. On top of that the screen is so small that using the virtual keyboard is a nightmare. This prevents me from being efficient with contact management and note taking. In deterred me from actually using the calendar and responding to text messages and emails. Unlike on the E72 I was not motivated to be organized with the software.The phone is also very very slow. Even with the latest firmware it is very slow. This made me abhor using this phone for any reason. Don't even think about installing software that runs in the background because it will eat your battery and retard your phone. The only way to make the device run at decent speeds is to minimize the software and the ROM.3) Battery - the battery life is terrible. It only lasts 12-15 hours on standby without 3G enabled.4) Camera -  the camera doesn't beat the N95 but it's alright. The camera software is sluggish and is very uncomfortable to use. The camera has bad auto focus and weak flash LED.5) Multimedia - the speakers on the phone is very weak so don't even bother watching movies or listening to music. Since this is a touch screen device the screen isn't big enough for me to enjoy videos or web-browsing.The sluggishness of this device also applied to it's Wi-Fi. That's why I avoided web-browsing altogether. It was just plain terrible. In fact I prefer the Nokia E90 or Nokia E72 for web-browsing (they are non touch screen phones).6) Phone - the call quality and loudness was at least better than my Nokia E72. However the X1 speakerphone can't even compare to the E72 speakerphone. Please recall that phones usually have two separate speakers: the speakerphone/loudspeaker and the normal speaker. Well the X1 has a very bad speakerphone/loudspeaker.8) Internet - the internet is slow the screen is small and the CPU needs an update. This should conclude everything.9) Price - at 800 U.S. dollars it was an expensive piece of junk. But now that it is sold for 400 dollars brand new it's a little more forgiving.10) Something to consider - regardless of all of the cons I have provided I enjoyed using the phone because it was highly customizable. Unfortunately it lacked everything I expected from what was advertised: an awesome keyboard perfect build quality fast processor. I tried to make the best of it by customizing it with software and 'tricks' and that alleviated some of the pain. Also so many people complemented on the beauty of my X1.11) History on X1: When the X1 first came out all of the reviewers gave the phone high marks for it's amazing build quality. Within a year everyone noticed that its cosmetic and physical condition deteriorated greatly. The phone reviewers returned the X1 to the 'lenders' before they got the chance to witness the true nature of this phone.
0	Don't know for sure if it was due to the cable or software but never got this to work. Gave up when I got a tablet (see my review for Motorola Xoom) and realized Bluetooth works great to transfer phone's photos. Price was cheap so it wasn't worth returning.
0	Bought to transfer photos out of my Samsung phone. Didn't work for anything but a charger. Save your money and go elsewhere!
2	its a really good cover for the iPhone but a little bulky and it does not have a perfect fit but works fine
2	gave to a friend not sure how they liked it but my otter box makes my phone soo much bigger :(
0	This was a waste of time buying it do not protect anything it should be called a shutterbox because your phone may breK INTO PIECES IF YOU DROP IT WITH THIS VERY THING RUBBER ON IT.
2	This was the best case I had ever had at first...then the light quit coming on on the face of the phone because the case stretched and began drooping and covered the sensors. I didn't ever remove it or stretch it so this just happened over a 2 month period. The protection this case offers is awesome and I do love the case for this reason I just ordered the defender case. I hope it doesn't have the same problem. I did contact otterbox about this problem and they were nice enough to send me a new case no questions asked. I just feel like the same problem will occur again and I wanted to try the defender. I know many people with the defender case and all of them love it and have had no problems with it so I recommend getting that one instead to have over a longer period of time. Hope this helps=)
2	This is just a rubber shell. I thought this was the whole Otterbox set....the plastic case & then the rubber case over it. Nope not this one. It's just a shell & doesnt go over my other Otterbox plastic cases so this is useless for me  :(
2	I ordered the Otterbox Impact case for my iphone 3g.. it arrived before the delivery date.. the case did not fit snug enough and I thought that was a defective product. I wrote the seller and was assured he would exchange it for another. He sent me a pre paid return label. Within a few days I had another case arrive in my mailbox.. it still does not fit real snug but is a nice case and for the money will do nicely.I would order from this seller again.. very nice person and easy to deal with.
2	In case it doesn't say anywhere else this is a silicone case.  it works alright but not as good as real otterbox.  My wife's phone shatter while being dropped in this case.  So it didn't really do its' job.
2	The Otterbox was ok but i believe I ordered the wrong item. I thought i was getting the hard case and the cover but this was only the cover. so as far as the cover goes it was what i had expected. so if you are looking for only the outside cover and not the hard case this product is great.
2	The case itself fits fine and the iphone is certainly quite usable with the case on.  I'm not doing any drop testing but like some others I'm sceptical about the claims of impact protection.I had a big problem with the clear screen protector -- it had little paper stickers on both sides (at the edge) that were to be pulled off before & after application.  EXCEPT ... they were paper and used cheap glue that didn't allow a clean peel-off so the screen protector was basically useless. (Why is it that products made in China seem to only use cheap glue?)  So that freebie ain't so great.If I were to do it over I'd probably go to a nearby discount store and get a cheapo silicone case for a couple of bucks less.  But this does the job I wanted done so I'm keeping it.
0	OK HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE? I do now. Get the Defender case which has hard plastic and rubber. this all rubber case is a waste of money but better than nothing. They are priced the same so get the better one.this is going back.
0	This case was absolutely perfect when I first received it.  It offers great protection is lightweight doesn't slide on a countertop etc and is comfortable to hold.  However after 3 months of continuous use I noticed that when I placed a phone call when I took the iPhone away from my ear to use the keypad speaker access an app or end a phone call the screen would stay black and wouldn't allow me to do anything.  I went to the Apple store thinking that something was wrong with my phone however the case was the issue.  There are little sensors near the speaker on the front of the phone in the little triangle cutout on the case.  The case had stretched out and covered the sensors so once the case was removed it works perfectly.
0	I can not believe that OtterBox puts their name on this product. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! This is junk.
2	I was torn between this and the DefenderOtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 3G 3GS (Black)[Retail Packaging] The reason I decided to go with the impact case was because I had no use for a belt-clip. The case fits the 3GS perfectly with everything aligning without flaw. It has a reassuring grip that is enhanced by the ridges on the back. The corners are well protected with extra contoured silicon. A screen overlay and microfiber wipe comes with the case which is a nice added touch. for less than 15 bucks this case is a winner in every way. The only downside I can see for some people would be the lack of a belt clip. The clip is a non-issue for me.Updated 6-1-2012The Black case is a great product. No issues whatsoever.The White case on the other-hand has had some problems. The biggest issue is that the cutouts on the face of the phone block the light sensor. So when you pull the phone away from your face it does not automatically show the end call button or keypad numbers.
0	As many recent reviews have noted this thing stretched out for me after about a month and now no longer aligns properly with the earpiece sensors and buttons.  It is not as sticky as some other rubberized cases I have used/seen but still gets stuck in your pocket and covered with a fair amount of lint.  I stopped using mine and went back to the the Marware Sport Grip case which can get really linty but holds the phone nice and snug.  The Otter is a Don't Buy.
2	It's ok but not worth the price.  I had it for a few months now the case started to rip apart.
2	I agree with the other reviewers. This completely awesome case will be nearly useless to you after a few months. Every silicone case I have tried for my iphone (about 5 separate silicone cases by different companies) will eventually stretch out of shape. In the case of this case (hah!) - it stretches out of shape and if you are trying to use the camera to take a pic the little hole for the lens no longer lines up! So you end up taking half covered shots or you take it out of the case. Either way its very annoying.I really wish someone could make a case that won't stretch. Is it really that hard? Can we send men up to a spacestation and rovers to Mars but we can't make a rubber case that won't stretch out of shape? Of course I am clueless about chemistry.
0	I have trusted OtterBox cases for years and I have relied on them. This case did not fit my iPhone 3 phone. I tried to return it but the vendor did not to admit it was a poor fit. It may be a fluke but that was my experience.
2	I really liked the protection this case offers especially on the corners. I liked the thinness of the sides as it allowed easy access to the screen along the edges. I liked the stickiness of it as it would sit on my car dash and not move. It did pick up a lot of lint and dust at first but rinsing it off once in a while helped that and after a while it didn't seem to pick up so much. What I didn't like was after about 5 months I took the case off and the material ripped in the bottom right corner. Then a week or so later when I took it off the material ripped in the upper right corner and this time it ripped way back into the thicker section. The material is way too thin around the corners and rips easily. It's a shame as I really liked the case.
2	The screen cover was stuck to the installation tab which left residue and made the screen cover itself worthless.  The cover is a stretchy silicon that offers little if any impact protection.  The only thing it does is make the phone bulkier and a little bit less slippery.  I was looking for something that would actually be protective since my husband's favorite trick is to drop his pants on the floor with his iPhone still in the pocket.  The pants offer more protection than this thing does.
0	Why when i type iPhone 4 case this comes up? There is no reason for it! Amazons Fault. Does anybody else feel this way?
2	It was white plastic it didn't come with the hard shell just the sleeve that goes over it. My daughter disliked it and frankly so did I. I will have to do a little more research next time I buy cases for my phone .
2	This case is good otter box never disappoints It did have a minor rip at the top of the case when i got it. it was the top part of my phone screen. But other than that fine.
2	I bought this for my daughter to use as a cover for her phone.  The case is rubber of course and nice but I prefer to get her a hard case next time!
2	But it also gets caught in my hair and after a while it actually started to interfere with the touch screen.  When making a call and wanting to use the functions during the call I would have to quickly pull the case off because the edges keep pressure on the digitizer and when you pull it away from your face the screen doesn't activate and light up like it should.  So if you want to mute/use keypad/etc you have to quickly pull the otterbox off and then the screen will activate.  Annoying.  I switched to a different case.
2	This case was good for a while (couple months) then it started covering up the part of the phone makes it think you have it up to your face (3 little sensors in the upper left of the screen) and since it was covered it would turn off the screen thus make hanging up or doing anything impossible.  It was annoying.
0	The cover sags a bit after sometime and it does not fit perfectly anyways. I would not recommend at all.
2	Bought this case and hoped it would be the harder version that is a little slicker and would not pull my hair but it does!  Works okay to protect the phone and for men or short haired women this would be fine but if you have long hair it will sure pull it.  Also will not go easily into my back pocket. Going to look for another case. Bummed......
2	This case was just ok for the money but it was hard to get in and out of my pocket and it collected lint really bad.The same day that I put this case on it fell out of a locker onto the tile from about 3 feet up it landed face down and made a small crack around the home button on my phone and the home button didn't work until i took it apart and reconnected it. I guess i got what I paid for though...
2	Takes very good photos though not in low light.  Hardware is sloppily built lots of wiggles not tight at all.  Keys are unusable.  S60 OS is mature and runs well.
2	I bought this to put in my car as I am on the a lot of rural roads with poor service and I like to stream music off of my phone.  I was barely able to pick up a bar of service no matter where I mounted the antenna and I still dropped calls in typical spots that I dropped them before I had it.  I couldn't ever tell a difference when it was working and when it wasn't and after 3 months use the USB power port broke and it is now useless.
2	This product was very easy to set up. The instructions were pretty simple and the function is clear. However I tried this in two locations and found no change at all to either my cellular or my wii fi. Having said that I'm still not convinced that this product doesn't do the job it claims to do. I just wonder about the locations I tried this in: a house in the country and an apartment in the city (this apartment has clear dead zones). My feeling is that this really does what it claims to if you are in the optimal environment for it. I will try it again in yet another location later but wanted to make this observation for people who are considering this purchase. It couldn't hurt to try it if you have issues with your current set up. I just wasn't lucky enough to get any benefit from it but it doesn't mean it won't work for you.
2	Hey this is pretty neat. Does what it says. You can use it in the car to get rid of the dead spots on your dirve. I tried this out streaming music and did not loose conection in the &#34;dead zones&#34; I was used to. Its also cool that it can run off a regular USB so you can power the booster off a laptop when a plug in power source is not available. It also cigarette and regular home outlet plug that the USB power cable plugs in to. I would reccomend this booster no problem. Downside is you must be close to this unit.
0	I was researching ways to boost cell signals when I found this.  After reading many reviews I realized that the issue of weak cell signals can be fixed easily and permanently with a cell phone that can use WIFI to make receive calls text and data.  A weak cell signal is a common problem with concrete and metal buildings shielding those signals out.  But we always have access to WIFI at home or in the office.  Republic Wireless solved this problem over two years ago.  It uses VOIP calling backed up by both Sprint Cell and Verizon roaming.  It also works world wide on WIFI for $5 a month.  Service is unlimited and has no contract.  An unlimited call and text plan is $10 a month and unlimited cell text and data is $25 a month.  You do have to use their phone (Moto X $299 or Moto G $149_ because they need Republic's proprietary software to work.  I have been using them for over 18 months now and it has worked perfectly. They give customers this link for $20 off when you join.  [...]
2	I have followed the directions as given and my iPhone reception is reasonable. Has it improved with the use of this device? I cannot really claim to have seen a difference but then I don't wear the Borg/Bluetooth earpiece so my phone goes with me when I talk on it. I still get an occasional dropped call or show minimal reception bars even when I sit the phone right next to the device to text message. I have used my phone both with and without the device and while not observing _strict_ scientific method I am not sure that I notice a difference either way.I have not tried the device in its auto configuration my use has been wholly stationary.Ultimately it seems like for my personal location my cell reception varies with and without the device and my benefit from using this signal booster is questionable enough so that I would not recommend that anyone spend the $200+ unless they are in dire need of a signal booster. P-)
2	I read the reviews on this and that is what sold me on getting it. But when I got it and hooked it up in 5 different locations it was not as good as they all said it was. You must keep the phone about 1' to the receiver. So you are stuck there like a land line. ! foot away it is great. I am not sending it back but don't get sold on the reviews like I did.
2	if you've been reading the reviews so far you'll understand that this device works as long as the antenna is placed in a particular way and it won't work regardless if you're out of your coverage.  I used it to get reception on my cellphone inside a shilded building where I would get 1 or 2 bars near the windows and nearly no data (which was what I wanted in the first place)The antenna's bottom is strongly magnetized as expected if you're to place it on your car.  a very solid piece.The repeater however has a poor feel as if it would break on the first drop.  The usb port which uses to be charged is loose and I had to try various usb cables i had lying around to find a snug fit.  the adapter that came with it was useless.  for the amount of electronics it contains inside I wish they had made it smaller and more dense.I've had good experience with Wilson Electronics in the past and in the very least it gets the job done without failure.  Since I moved out of that building I've ended up repurposing the antenna to the wifi router using some tape since the antenna was lost and eventually plan to throw the repeater into my car for long trips so i can insure myself a little more coverage than what verizon in road trips.
2	I've always been skeptical of cell phone boosting devices (short of picocells that use your Internet connection and are officially sold by the wireless carriers.) But given the mediocre AT&T; (yes I'm an iPhone 3G user) reception in the heart of Silicon Valley I thought this device might help. A co-worker told me good things about the Wilson Electronics brand and this device is made and supported in the USA!First of all I'm not a fan of using mobile phones in cars for the distraction reason -- and adding more lighter plugs and cords is a messy affair. So my goal of this review is to explain how the device works in my apartment sticking the antenna to the window. First of all per the instructions you do need to keep the actual device (which you'll keep near the phone) AT LEAST 8 feet/2.5 meters from the included antenna or there will be no effective coverage change (and the device will light yellow instead of green.) After doing that I placed a couple of calls with my iPhone (and still had a dropped AT&T; call though that probably isn't the direct fault of the device) and the 2 out of 5 signal strength bars didn't go up a bit. I wasn't looking for the device to improve 3G or EDGE coverage as I'm using WiFi at home for that anyway.As other reviewers have said your phone needs to be within 6in to 12in (15cm to 30cm) from the device to amplify the signal. Yes I tried that and no change. That's not real great for using a mobile phone if you truly need to be stationary. Then half the time when standing right next to it the light turns yellow which makes the device useless for boosting the signal. Maybe I'm better off using theWilson Electronics 801247 Desktop Cell Phone Signal Booster for Home or Office - For Multiple Usersfor that purpose but as I haven't tried that can't comment on whether it really helps or not.The device however is well built. All the necessary accessories are included and handily the device is powered over the USB standard so you can use whatever existing cords and adapters you may already own. Perhaps in some conditions with other carriers phones or a different location you'll get better reception and in that case it might be worth the high asking price. I'll have to try it out the next time I visit family in rural Marin County (north of San Francisco) where cell phone signals are very sparse to begin with to see if this device improves extremely poor conditions. I really wanted the product to work and the device is well documented but I can't extend a positive review beyond two stars (and perhaps that's too generous.)
0	This battery never made it through a single day's use on my wife's phone despite &#34;breaking it in&#34; with several charges. I would not recommernd this battery to anyone although I know the price is cheap compared to the OEM batteries sold by AT&T. I definitely don't know this for sure but if I had to guess I'd say these were rejects or recycled.
2	Not sure what all th hip is about. This is one of the worst headsets that I've ever owned and beleive me I've just about had all the expensive ones. The fit is just down right in the toilet. Constantly messing with the piece to keep it touching your jaw. The volume control is the worst design that I've seen. I could go on and on about the design of this bluetooth but whyJust let it die. Theres better ones out thereie plantronics 510 and the Voyager/Pro.
0	don't buy this no one can ever hear me i have to repeat everything and always just give up and disconnect.
0	I returned my Jawbone after just one very frustrating day.All control buttons are hidden from view and touch. Attempts to adjust the volume cancelled my calls.Not recomended.
0	Krusell and Amazon are playing games with product coverage. 1.5 mos after purchasing one of the belt loops came completely detached. Amazon won't return or exchange since it's over a month old. Krusell claims to have a lifetime warranty but after completing their online registration process for warranty they require activation  - which they never send! Buy at your own risk - your product will NOT be protected!
2	The material was extremely cheap and the phone did not fit with an otterbox case. I would not recommend this product if you want something nice.
2	The material is of decent quality - good faux leather with seams enforced by strong stitching.However as my title suggests it is too snug of a fit for the Nokia N900 and the Samsung Vibrant which it states it does (the Vibrant). It is fine for insertion but the problem is when you try to take the phone out - you have to REALLY yank the phone out. Since both phones are touch screens I've had too many instances where I mistakenly rejected calls trying to get the phones out.Not to mention it could be potentially disastrous when you yank it too hard and the phone ends up flying out of your hands.The inner dimensions are stated at 115x61x18 mm which do not properly fit the Vibrant's length and width - 123x64x13 mm- and the N900's depth - 110x60x19 mm (my own measurements).Look elsewhere if you have these 2 phones.MEASURE your phone first!
2	This case didn't hold the phone tightly on my belt using the clip. As one might expect the loose clip broke after a month.Fortunately it has loops too so it's still usable.
2	The case itself is nicely constructed and it is a TIGHT fit to the S3. The bottom slip is shallow for pushing the phone out and as I am by no means svelte this case is a rare use for me.
0	Bought this for my 3GS and it did not fit right.  Only came with adhesive ( double stick tape type ) that fit the top and bottom not the sides.  When I placed the glass it stuck just fine on top and bottom but bowed a little in the center.  It was not a problem with placement.  It was perfectly aligned.  Because of the way it bowed the touch screen would not work properly.
0	sO FAR i HAVE ORDERED 3 DIFFERENT REPLACEMENT SCREENS FOR MY IPHONE AND NONE OF THEM WILL STAY ATTATCHED TO THE MOTHER BOARD. THE DIGITIZER RIBBON SNAP IS THE WRONG SIZE (TOO BIG) AND WILL NOT STAY ATTATCHED. I CHECKED IT WITH A DIFFERENT ORIGINAL APPLE IPHONE SCREEN JUST TO MAKE SURE IT WASNT THE MAIN BOARD AND ITS NOT. MY OTHER SCREEN SNAPPED IN JUST FINE. THE RIBBONS ON THESE SCREENS ARE WRONG
0	My IPhone did not fit in the case - very disappointed.  Was looking forward to using the case with my phone.
0	Don't let the picture and wording fool you.  This is not a good product.  Some type of fake leather wrapped around some thin cardboard.
2	Nice quality but it won't work with the iphone's otter box so it's useless to me.  Anyone not using the outter box can't go wrong with this case.
2	
0	you get what you get for the price. The &#34;magnet&#34; to close lasted a day. Dont waste a penny on it
0	Genuine leather ..? the back piece is not leather it's synthetic and bad quality material. So the belt clip in a few weeks later is completely damaged ..It seems that poor quality starts from the factory as one of the side panels also came unstitched.A star they do not allow half placed ..
2	This is a great looking case especially considering the low price. Unfortunately the side strips that hold the case together very quickly rip at the seam leaving you with an unusable case -- worse if they finally snap while you're wearing it you could be dropping or losing your phone.I used to own a similar case for a different phone and they used an elastic material for the side strip instead of the thin band of leather used on this one. The elastic band was perfect for the job; the leather just rips within days. I purchased two of these cases and they both failed the same way.Until the manufacturer rethinks the construction of the side strip I cannot recommend this product.
2	Once again I order another case that is too small. My case on my phone is about as thin as they make them yet this was still too small for it. It fits in their but its a pain to get in and out and it's always pushing the lock button when I put it back in. At least I could clip it to my belt because most won't do that without stretching out the clip. Overall it will work for what I need as I only need it when I wear a black belt which is not often. DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU HAVE AN OTTERBOX OR A LIFEPROOF IT WILL NOT FIT.
2	For the price this product works just fine.  Especially if you want a belt carrier for your iPhone or other similar smart phone without the bulk of a protective cover.  No frills though.
2	Actually the title says it all: Contrary to the website description this pouch while nice by itself DOES NOT FIT AN iPhone 4 in a very thin protective skin (and hardly fits it without the skin). The width of the pouch is insufficient. Can't use for iPhone 4...
2	It looks nice but the quality is bad. Used only less than half year it's broken  already. Won't recommend this case to anyone.
0	The pouch looked better in picture. After putting on the protective cover for the iphone I can scarely put the iphone into the pouch. The pouch was so tight that it kept hitting the call button. I do not use it now. This pouch was meant for iPhone. Seriously who do you know do not put protective cover on their iPhone. Should have made the pouch with a little more width. Not a lot of choices.
2	I liked the material and looks good; but it is a little too tight fitting and it is not possible to take your phone out easily. I would have preferred to be large enough so even using a protector cover on the phone could easily slide it out to answer the phone.
2	For the price you get what you pay for. This item is cheaply priced therefore the quality of this case is also cheap.
2	this case looks great but doesnt really offer anything in ways of protection. i dropped it and my phone poppped out of the case causing minor scratches on the sides. i know having the sides exposed doesnt protect it much anyways but i didnt expect it to fall out of its case so easily.
2	Do yourself a favor and look somewhere else for a case for your Zune Hd. This case is NOT real leather as advertised and it's suppose to have a magnetic closing device on it and it does NOT so the case never closes. I emailed the seller and they promptly refunded my money.
2	Basic case. Doesnt provide much protection. I would suggest spending the extra money and getting a sturider case. Doesnt do much other than provide fashion.
2	The newer Voyager Pro is much much better but this was a good bluetooth device in it's day.  Not as tough as I would have liked though.
2	I used this only for a few months. It was alright....did the job....very funky looking though....not a bad price though.
2	I've tried other wallet cases and none can hold a note to this one. Other cases are made mostly of a vinyl while this is a faux leather. I found its durability is far greater. The button snap is a huge advantage vs a magnetic flap.
2	This did case did not hold up very well. Although it's really cute it got dirty and fell apart rather quickly. If I could do it over I would've invested in a different case.
0	I had one that was magnetic closure this is a snap wish I had known that its is flimsy and not up to my standards
2	I did not buy it from amazon but another site which gave me a harness to plug and play this unit.Installation with the help of a friend took an hr because of how we routed the wires.At times it has trouble connecting to my Galaxy Nexus because if I start my car using my remote starter it sometimes doesn't see my device so I have to go into the menus and manually say connect to bluetooth audio.This is annoying at times but that's all.  The addition of the ipod and usb drive options are good.What I wish the software would do is when you connect a usb drive instead of having every artist listed an alphabet can appear first and then you can select the artist.Every time I start my car if I want to listen to an artist that starts with the letter N for instance I have to scroll all the way to that artist starting from A.If playlists or if it had internal memory to remember your last song played was available in this model it would be perfect. I would then buy a 64gb usb drive and use that as my storage instead of streaming from google play during my daily commute. Audio is solid for music and a bit muffled for conversations but it could be my vehicle (2005 Ford Explorer sport trac) that has a loud interior driving noise.If you want a solid bt set that is not in your ear this is the unit for you.I may even just use this for music and use my plantronics for business calls.LOVE THAT THIS UNIT CUTS OUT YOUR MUSIC AND OR FACTORY RADIO TO TAKE CALLS.I see no reason to get the color screen because this is so low profile it's not in your way.
0	The spring in the unit pushes the two way out of the 12v socket.  I contacted the seller and got no repsonse.Update it partially melted last time I used it.  Fire hazard?  Possibly.
2	Was looking for a device to help with vehicles especially rental ones that do not have an abundance of outlets for all the electronic &#34;toys&#34; that we have.  This is okay but there are others available that have USB ports as well.  They are great.
2	They're cheap but work. I've ordered a few since they just break in one way or another. Since purchasing my last one I've invested in a more durable and reliable device. The reliability and durability of this one is not guaranteed.
0	So it is now in the closet  maybe to be sold at a yard sale one day. bad purchase decision on my part Great concept just doesn't work with older vehicles
0	I was really excited about this! I wanted to be able to charge my phone and use my radar detector simultaneously it worked great for almost a month and then all of the sudden it stopped. Nothing is broken or out of place that I can see and I never moved it but it definitely does not work anymore. I did get a refund and the sellers were very polite but the fact remains the same... It does not work forever

2	I was looking forward to getting this Wilson Electronics cell phone signal booster because I've struggled for years with poor cell phone reception in my basement. However after I hooked this thing up I noticed very little if any improvement in my reception. At first I thought I might've hooked it up wrong so I unhooked-rehooked it up a total of three times with the same results. On occasion I can see a temporary one-bar increase in my reception but that's the exception not the norm. The vast majority of the time my basement reception is still horrible. Maybe there are other factors at play (my cellular carrier house construction etc.) but the minimal benefit from this product in my particular situation is the reason for my 3-star review.
0	I tries several different spots through out my home and it just could get a good signal to replicate. I will try another brand to see if it works.
2	We live in a rural area that has spotty-to-no-coverage.  We can lose a call just by dropping over a hill.  These boosters have helped but we're not seeing a jump from 'no service' to '4 bars' or anything like that.  If we have 1-bar when we start the booster doesn't give more bars but it will help hold the call (we won't drop it where we usually do).
2	We live in a metropolitan area with spotty signals from every cell service we've tried over the years and even the satellite radio service we used to have. Come around the bend and oops! Gone. But it seems like that all depends on which way the wind is blowing. There is probably something more technical than wind direction involved in the service drops but I'm not positive there is.I hoped that this gadget would set the service straight and steady. But did the Wilson boost the signal or were we just having a good day? Hard to say. While it was engaged we never lost signal but I can't say that the signal was improved either. Maybe the bars on my phone lifted by one just because or maybe they lifted because I pulled the phone away from my head to look and happened to angle the phone just right thereby grabbing a better signal. From the Wilson? Could be.This was tough to review because it's hard to say if anything useful was happening. We will be vacationing in an area with really bad cell service and after testing at that location I will report back. Until then I leave the review at a neutral three-stars.
0	I made sure this was compatible with my phone before i bought it and it is. This did not work for me at all. I was so excited when it arrived. i followed the instructions carefully and it still did not work in fact it seemed to mess with my WiFi signal a little. do yourself a favor and dont buy this garbage. good thing i can get a refund.
0	I went to great lengths to make sure I bought the 33 dollar one direct from Amazom. It came with Blackberry packaging and authentic looking markings. 2 weeks in it's already failing to hold a charge throughout the day. I don't know if it's related or not but the unit now seems to reboot spontaneiously once every other day or so- I'm talking the full 10 minute reboot too not just a soft restart. Really unhappy with Amazon on this one. I bought a cheaper one about a month ago that was bad right out of the box. Why is it so hard to just get a real battery to replace the OEM one?
2	Nothing about the packaging or the battery as delivered by the seller would lead me to believe that the battery I received was not an OEM BlackBerry battery. I ordered this battery as a replacement for my wife's phone. She went from about 2 days of light usage before having to charge to making sure the phone was on the charger every night. After installing this battery it seemed to help a bit but she may have been having an issue with a social network updating app running in the background. She hasn't complained about it since &#34;fixing&#34; that issue so I'm giving this a fair review of it's neither bad nor good as it is exactly as described.One note my seller sent the item in a &#34;sealed&#34; bag. In other words the battery did not come in retail packaging. It was instead in a plastic bag that had a sticker &#34;seal&#34; on it.  This reminded me of the type of packaging that I receive when ordering many types of OEM computer replacement parts; they'd come in a brown box or a static bag. This battery arrived in similar fashion. As I have read on other reviews it has been described as shady this was nothing of the sort.
0	I have the white iphone and ordered a white color elago case to go with it. From the picture it looks nice but in reality it's cheaply manufactured plastic junk. IT'S PLASTIC covered in white paint and the plastic edge rough and will scratch you iphone. Spend some more money and get a better casing.
2	This case gets the job done but is not the best case I have invested in. The hole for the camera is very small which allows for a lot of back-flash.
2	the case fits great but it only covers the back of the iphone. the chrome border is very exposed and still prone to scratches. the case also makes it hard to reach for the volume buttons. decent cheap case overall.
0	Pictures would have you believe this a near mil-spec case protecting your phone from shock moisture and dirt. Not even close.  Specifics...Once assembled around the phone the unit easily falls out of included belt clip.  The two little ears on the belt clip do not securely hold the phone and case in place.  At best this is a case you store in your pocket or purse although the case makes the phone quite bulky.  With the phone in the case the charge cord cannot be connected or at least we can't get any of the multiple chargers we own to work (we own 11 I Phones).  The outer rubber housing meant to absorb shock is thin...far thinner than standard Otter Box soft phone cases and the inner yellow shell is made of hard unyielding plastic so I doubt if this case offers much real protection if your IPhone is dropped from any height.  This is one poorly conceived design meant I suspect to look tough but not much else.  The Otterbox Defender Series 3 case fails in every way and given how poorly it performs it is grossly overpriced to boot.
0	i got my money taken up and all they did was reply thats it now i can't even contact them i sent the otter back and never got the money don't waste your time buying this
2	no longer have the Iphone 3g but this thing served it purpose! I now have the Iphone 5s and otterbox just keeps improving their products!
0	Any otterbox is over rated.griffin is the way to go.period!never buy otterbox. they are not as protective as many others. but they sold a walmart so its all people know.
0	I own this and a Tilt and I provide Windows Mobile applications and video drivers in my spare time.Easy to Google for benchmarks and details as with the Tilt this is another HTC/Qualcomm device with well-documented inferior (4 TIMES slower) multimedia capabilities compared to other (Samsung LG Toshiba Apple Nokia) devices.  The FUZE actually benchmarks slightly slower than circa 2002-2003 200MHz PocketPC devices when it comes to multimedia. It's unfortunate the htc class-action law suite hasn't panned out.This does have a superior keyboard compared to the Xperia X1 but the GREASY finger-print attracting thin casing makes the phone feel like a toy.  The Diamond points in the back of the case also will wear in less than a week due to the poor plastic quality.VGA is amazing on this device albeit wasted on less than 2.8 size instead of a more useful and eye-forgiving 3.  You can actually also take photos with this versus the blurring/stuttering Tilt camera and the pictures look spectacular.  Accelerometer-enabled album viewing takes much of the pain out of portrait vs landscape.  Too bad the album still isn't syncable with Picasa or such for easy off-loading.However the new USB drive mode (directly accesses the microSD/HC and locks off access Windows Mobile) makes it easy to transfer files or use a directory-based album browser for the photos.The auto-backlight tends to be too bright and doesn't get dark enough in dark settings.  Luckily there's apps such as LevelSight that can deal with this.HSDPA is locked off until you work around AT&T;'s registry locks so 3G speeds will be quite slow.  This is either because the towers are overloaded by iPhones or the back haul off the towers are only 1Mbps max.The Push-To-Talk is useless and there isn't an obvious way to reassign the button for some other use.  Luckily there's some hacks you can Google for to reassign it to do two different things such as bring up the Comm Manager and the Camera app.Another major issue is the GPS is really slow for the initial lock.  It can take up to TWO minutes before it locks compared to a Tilt.  Turning on A-GPS (without signing onto AT&T; Navigator) doesn't improve the speed and will actually cause all 3rd party GPSs to loose their GPS lock repeatedly (in a 1 minute time span and beyond) including Garmin Mobile XT and iGo8 after finally getting that GPS lock.  Luckily again there's an app called FusionGPSFix that attempts to deal with this.It's too bad this is a One and Company Design because the design is mostly about show and not reliable usability.For instance they destroyed the d-pad.  It's almost impossible to hit left or right on the 4-way direction pad because there is no pad and the control surface is shared with 4 other buttons.  You're more likely to hit Dial or Home with a sloppy press for left.  You're more likely to hit Back or Hangup with a sloppy press for right.  These limitations hit especially hard if you want to just navigate in the Calendar program or play a game.Combined with the bad d-pad design is sharing the same surface with an iPod capacitive scroll capability.  Superficially it would be nice for one thumb to be able to scroll iPod-like through lists and then hit the center button to select.  Reality is the drawing a circle around the center button results in not very responsive behavior and moving the thumb to the center for selection can cause accidentally more scrolling.It's also inane to put the Volume and PTT button on the side of the slider face that makes it slide!  If you push any of these buttons the whole face will twist and wiggle.  This really shows the keyboard-slide was a sloppy add-on to the original Diamond design.
2	When I plugged in the earphones to this adapter I was able to hear sound but when I talked the person on the other end of the line could not hear me.  I bought it so I could use it to talk on the phone so it is worthless to me.
2	i bought this for a friend  of mine who has the samsung blackjack 2.Unlike other wired headsets when you use this you cannot plug it in before or after a call. you have to call someone and then plug it it during the call.whent he call ends you must remove it becuase when you are not talking anyone the adapter has a bad habit of constantly redialing and hanging up over and over and over.I am not sure if its the adapters fault or the phones but i dont recommend this. use a bluetooth instead or get a new phone( or cell providor)
0	Samsung's use of a proprietary jack for both charging the phone and connecting a headset is a miserable design decision from the consumer's perspective. I'm sure it adds to their bottom line. I've tried three of these adapters from two different suppliers and none work with a known-to-be-functional headset. Giving up and going back to my bluetooth earpiece.
0	I ordered 2 of these items and they shipped something totally different then they shipped the right item but neither of them worked. One of them was broken and the other one didnt pass sound wouldnt buy from here again. although they were kind enough to give me a refund thats good.
2	Great pricecame quickly but the piece in the middle kept falling apart till I ended up pitching it in the trash ;(
0	Havent gotten them yet. Ordered them November 18th and its December 9th. I emailed them and they said it is because they are out of the country and to gove it 2 weeks. It had already been more than that when I emailed them on Friday. So I guess my kids will get them sometime next year.
2	I purchased these to use with my cell phone when I'm unable to locate or haven't charged my bluetooth earpiece.  As long as you're ok with &#34;basic sound&#34; they work fine. However they are a bit cumbersome. Just remember you get what you pay for.  They not meant for constant use.
0	this is a piece of cheap junk. well i guess you get what you pay for in some cases. i bought this for my daughter and the tip broke off in her phone the same day that i gave it to her.the noise hush is real good.Big C.
0	One end is longer than the other and its mic is bad i hate it and it broke after 2 months
0	this is the 3rd or 4th pair of headphones they always stop working after a awhile. :/ and its always one side of the headphone.
2	The sound is terrible.  The mic is bad.  The ear buds are uncomfortable.  The wires are thin and very fragile.  If you have not guessed by now I would not recommend.  Spend a few dollars more and get better quality.
2	Well there is not much to say than you get what you paid for this are really cheap headphones the jack almost fell apart in my hand once i connected it to my laptop and even worse when i tried to unplug it but again... i got what i paid for.On the sound quality average... i couldnt ask for anything like Stereo or something like that... at least they worked.
2	Really good sound but my husband didnt realize that one of the headphones wire is shorter than the other. Good quality but not what the pic shows.
2	I purchased a few of these to replace some other cheap headsets that broke finally. They aren't that great but they got the job done.
0	its ok one ear phone is longer than the other after a while they will break on you u get what u pay for.
2	This type of pry tool tends to wear out quickly. When this happens it is great to have a replacement. I found a set of professional spudgers on Amazon that seem to be more durable but even so these are nice to have.
2	Went through 3 of the 10 that were sent the first day I got these. I needed these to open a HP Sleekbook also a old iPod touch. Using them on the HP I broke 2 of them and 1 on the iPod. These are disposable tools once used so look else were if your needing something that will need to be used daily.
2	I bought these strictly for the price which was a mistake. I needed them to help me replace the back housing on my Verizon Galaxy Nexus which was all beat up by the prior owner. These spudgers came as described but there's a good reason you get ten of them (5 wide 5 thin) because they are flimsy. I broke two of the thin ones off trying to get the housing free from the digitizer. Once I got it pried up the back came off with no further help so mission accomplished but only after losing two of these guys. Also they are poorly constructed. Most of the thin ones had molding flash on the business end which had to be removed by shaving it off with a knife. Further the ones that didn't break left little pieces of debris behind. In the final analysis for light duty you can't go wrong on the price. If however you do this kind of work a lot pass these by and get something more substantial say from iFixit.
2	I got this for by boyfriend as a gift.  He already had a T-Mobile sim card from a flip phone but hated texting on it.  First his address did not open up in the Blackberry.  Then we tried to open wi-fi and there is none on this phone unless you pay by the minute to T-mobile.  Since this phone was advertised as a unlocked phone and the person purchasing it would be using an already existing sim card THAT GPS THAT NEEDS WI-FI WOULD NOT BE LISTED AS A FEATURE. As far as I can tell that means the GPS won't work either without a monthly package from T-Mobile. That also means you can't load apps and no Blackberry Messenger.Otherwise I guess he likes the phone.  I however feel ripped off.
2	Adquiri este telefono hace un par de meses pero no le habia activado hasta un par de semanas atras luego que le hice la actualizaci&oacute;n del software me dej&oacute; de funcionar el edge. Lejos de eso todo bien. El empaque y el env&iacute;o bien aunque no en su caja de Blackberry original
2	I used this many moons ago but it did charge my blackberry and I used it at work as my clock.
2	This charger is reliable for about 6 months. It has recently started to not fully set into my phone tightly and unless I lay my phone while charging in a flat stable surface although plugged in doesn't continue the charge and is very loose. Probably going to have to buy another one because I don't want to wake up in the morning and realize that I have no charge on my battery.
0	I bought this as a second charger for my Blackberry Tour. It appears to charge the phone but the phone is basically non-functional when the charger is connected. Once the charger is removed the phone starts working again.
0	It worked for a couple months then just up and stopped charging my phone. I was very upset. I set it on fire.
0	I bought two as spare chargers.  I wasted my money they never charged and I actually think they ruined one of the phones.  Thank God I have the protection plan and got the phone replaced. For the price I didn't even bother returning them. It may work for some but it did not work for me and my gs3.
0	I bought this for a gift and it was dead on arrival. Maybe it was just a bad one but the trouble it takes to return something bought online is just too much so I just trashed it.
0	I DO NOT recommend it.It did not last very long is VERY CHEAPLY made. Please dont wast your money on it. Pay a little bit more and get a better one. It is a piece of junk I had I known it I would NOT had purchased!KarlaC
2	Not reliable. I bought 2 and they both don't charge very well. 50% of the time it stopped charging for no reason.
2	My last charger broke and I needed a new one. I liked the compact design of this charger so I ordered it. There isn't much to review as it is just a phone charger. The one caution I would say is that mine wasn't very durabled. One tumble off my nightstand while plugged into my phone and the charger was broken. It was super cheap so I'm not mad just frustrated. I'm guessing I'm not alone in having a phone take a small dive from a nightstand to the floor (about 3 feet). I just wish it could have taken a couple falls for it to break as opposed to one.
0	Gave it to girlfriend to use on her blackberry phone she said it got hot and it stopped working. Maybe only charged phone once or twice ???
0	Just like another item I bought from Orange Discount Center it wasn't OEM even though it said it was. My fault. I know better.
2	Bought two of these.  One failed after a year.  The other is still going and works fine.  They are cheap so no telling how long they last.  It charges slower than OEM charger also.
2	it will last about a year before it stops working and falls apart. i guess you cant beat the price for the product?
2	Although the Torch wasn't listed in the list of supported devices I took a chance since the connector is the same (microUSB).  When I plug in the charger it charges for a few seconds then stops.  It was so cheap I won't bother returning it.Not sure if it works with the phones listed.  I can't really give it a low rating since they never said they'd support the Torch.
2	I've owned these for about a year now and recently switched out to the Jaybird blue tooth headphones which I prefer over these.  These are decent enough if you want to use them indoors but they are absolutely terrible if you want to use them outside.  They are nearly worthless outside unless you're holding your player in your right hand or have it in an armband on your right arm. Any other spot and they drop out like crazy.
0	I had at least 4 sets of these. I run and they were great to run in except as one of the other commenter's said they constantly cut out. I finally placed my LG up on my shoulder about 10 inches away and it stayed in contact.Every one of them quit working after about 20miles. Company said might be due to sweat getting in. They sounded great so I was hoping the company would fix this problem. So far they haven't. So if you are a couch potato who wants a wireless head set that answers the phone these are great. 5 stars. But if your active and sweat just a little don't purchase. Donnie
0	I was given a set of these and I can't for the life of me figure out why people like them so much.  The sound quality is great but there is no bass at all but thats kind if expected for the size.  Call quality is superb and hands free works flawlessly too. Very comfortable around my head too.  Battery life is also great.  So why is it I hate them so much?  The signal!  Its terrible!  Don't expect to work out with this pair.  The more you move the more your audio cuts in and out.  And if I stick my phone in my pocket it cuts out to the point I usually get frustrated and shut them off and use my loud speaker.  Ashame really if not for the signal issues i'd give this pair 5 stars.  But its a major deal breaker!
2	I do a lot of mountain biking and wanted a bluetooth headset than is comfortable to wear and has good audio quality.  I got both with this set however I'm REALLY getting frustrated with the lack of consistency on the bluetooth connection.  Sometimes it is flawless and doesn't cut out but typically that is only when I'm not on my bike.  Working out in the gym or around the house is fine but for some reason when I start moving fast or biking with my phone in my pocket it just cuts in and out frequently.....which is a REAL buzz kill when you're in the groove!Also there is no way to tell how much battery life is left on the set.  It will just stop working all of a sudden which is also a buzz kill in mid-workout.The audio quality on the phone portion isn't really good either but that's not why I bought them.  When listening to others it can sound like they are in a tunnel and they have said they same thing about my voice on their end.  I have a Jawbone Icon HD for talking to others so this isn't a big deal to me except when people call me in mid-workout.Overall they are a nice set to have just be aware of the issues you may get when biking or running.
0	While the sound quality is awesome the limitation of not using these outside is just plain dumb. I had two sets of these- thinking the first one was defective. In smaller enclosed spaces like offices living room airplane seat etc. they work great. Try to use them in a large fitness center or outdoors like for jogging cycling etc. and the audio cuts out about 3-4 times each minute. Apparently the bluetooth receiver in this thing isn't very sensitive so it depends on walls to bounce the signal from your player to the headset. No walls = poor performance. At first I thought my first set was defective. But after getting a warranty replacement and experiencing the same problems I read the instructions. (I know I know). They explain that you should put your music player in a back pocket preferably as high/close to the headset as you can. How dumb is that? I did find that if my music player is placed in line-of-sight within 6-8 inches of the headset it works uninterrupted. I had a great deal of trouble jogging while holding my MP3 player behind my head.One more thing that really bugs me. Motorola outsourced its customer service jobs to outside the United States. If you care about this (as I do) you might want to know.
2	Bluetooth headphones seem to be an unloved niche in R&D; departments. Although this is my only pair I've owned I spent a fair amount of time researching other options and none seemed nail the product. So one has to settle and I've settled for these.These do fairly well. When I first got them I tried them out in a variety of settings. I had a fair amount of cut-outs when paired with my computer. Watching my iPad across the kitchen also was hit or miss. Oddly enough the first few runs I did with these headphones resulted in the music cutting out several times. Now I mainly just run in these but the cutting out seems to have disappeared. I hold my phone in my hand and I rarely have it cut out. The battery also lasts a couple weeks between charges (I only run 2-4 times a week). The SRS enhancement also is impressive. I have also had no problems with these malfunctioning due to sweat (I even ran with them in the rain last night).I have several complaints about these headphones though. Most importantly and I couldn't find this anywhere else I've noticed that the speed/pitch of your music will change when streaming over bluetooth. It sounds as though there is a slight buffering going on and since the connection is worse at some times it slows down and then catches up when it is better. While this effect certainly isn't exaggerated it is noticeable and degrades the listening experience. I've also had this headset randomly skip tracks. The ear pieces are decent however they constantly make a clicking noise in my ears when I run since they aren't canal buds or headphones. They straddle this awkward middle ground. Finally you cannot lie down on your back in these as is mentioned in other reviews (other than that the fit isn't too uncomfortable though they do hurt your ears at first)That all being said I would probably still get them again. Not because they are good but I am not convinced that there are really any better products out there that justify their price increase. It is a pleasure to run without wires and these do a decent job. However they certainly aren't without flaws. By the way I ordered these over the newer model due to the price and the reviews on sound quality.So if you need bluetooth headphones unfortunately these may be your best options at this time. It seems like wireless audio transfer has a bit of growing up to do before this problem is solved. For now I'll be sticking with these and pretending like those key changes were intended.I hope this was helpful. Good luck in your decision. Let me know if there are any questions I can answer for you!
2	I was so excited when I got these headphones (no more cords!!!!!).  The first time I used them walking across campus they worked great with no problems at all.  They were/are very comfortable around my big head.  But the 2nd time I used them was in a crowded restaurant and the voices from a couple of movies I tried to watch (online then a different movie on iPhone) were inaudible.  I tested it once I got to a quieter place and I could understand what they were saying but I don't think this would work while on a treadmill.  And the reason I'm returning them; today while walking across campus trying to listen to an audio book it kept losing the signal.  I don't know if it's interference from others around me or what but headphones are pretty much useless to me if I can't use them in anything other than the library or a tomb.
2	So far I have only used this is as stereo headset.  I have not yet used it for phone calls.  Sound is ok. No complaints.  Range from bluetooth device seems limited compared to my motorola s305's.
0	I had several copies of the previous version of this and they were great until they died which was typically around 6 months after purchase. I don't know whether or not this model is still sold but it is too heavy over the ears.
0	I never use them - always cutting out even as normal telephone headset.  I tried with multiple types of phones and it just doesn't cut it.
0	I have no idea how Motorola can claim this as ever being a 'flagship' of their stereo bluetooth headphones.  I had no problem syncing it installing it figuring out how to use the buttons (though they are a bit small and annoying).  However I never use it because it drops syncing with no provocation.  Compared to my much cheaper motorola stereo bluetooth headphones (S305) these simply do not work.  They sync for 3 minutes and then drop the connection.  I can re-sync I can stand in the exact same spot listening to the exact same music on the exact same phone as my S305 and the S305 works just fine and this piece of carp just skips and then drops the signal.  And this is using a MOTOROLA phone! (Z6m)Do not buy any S9 or S10 or S-anything from Motorola unless you like to curse.  My only questions how could the S9-HD be an upgrade from the S9?  The S9 must be used as a coat hook only.
0	I tried the S9 because of the reviews. A mistake!!! The fit wrapping around the back of the neck and pulling on the ears drives me crazy. I used the S9 only for iMac computer. Had a terrible time pairing.But the tight grabbing at the neck fit was totally un acceptable.Exchanged for the Jabra Halo BT650s set and have loved the Jabra Halo 100%.
2	These are great for walking or other low-impact activities.  However they were really not about to stay put on my head when I was running at the gym.  I spent much of that workout fiddling with them before I finally gave up.  Great sound quality and easy to use though; I'll keep them for use around the house or at the office :)
2	First item is not water-proof (shorted out after a light rain) so i doubt how effective they are at being sweat resistant its likely they will short out eventually with heavy sweat...2nd the function button dont work properly on it seems that the problem are unique to each type of apple device being used when I read on amazon; for my ipod touch 3gen no skip to next song button..if the price came down on these to 20-30 bucks they would be worth having but at $45 plus pass...BTW if your thinking then ill try the other models I would be highly cautions after all this model is their latest!!UPDATE: MOTOROLA NOW HAS THE S10...I wonder how long it will take these model to go down to my ideal price???
2	I wanted to listen to music on my HTC Diamond [Sprint] while exercising and around the house without wires. This unit has good sound and nice controls - I can activate voice command for hands free dialing and I can change music tracks without pulling out the phone; Nice.Unfortunately the thing is really uncomfortable after a while especially while wearing my glasses. Note however that I have a large head and the unit is not adjustable [like that would have been difficult to design in].Additionally and I knew this before purchasing by reading other reviews you cannot carry your phone in your front pocket while using these outside. I put the phone in my rear pocket if walking but I'll have to wear a fanny pack or some other trick to get the transmitter within line-of-sight of the back of the headset. This is another pain-in-the-rear [no pun intended!].I will say it's really cool to be out for a run when the phone rings and the auto-answer is turned on; the unit picks up and I can talk without having to slow down. I can dial out as well with the voice command.The bluetooth technology is limited but I think the designers could have made this more friendly.This unit may just be the best available for now but it seems likes it should still be in beta to me.
2	These headsets sound great. My problem with them is due to my usage. I use these when I go running or I'm at the gym and I tell you they are terrible for that. It starts off okay but then as you move the bottom &#34;power&#34; button becomes very VERY sensitive and gets pressed when it bounces off the back of my neck or back. This has a domino effect in that suddenly the volume goes to the max or the track skips. Lately I've noticed it hates the charging also. When I plug it in it may or may not charge. I like the idea but the execution is terrible. I would not recommend it. I'll use it until it dies and will just simply buy something else.
2	It fit my wife ok but for me now way. Had to return it. Also from what I could hear it was not very good.
0	I got Motorola S9-HD for a week now because I did not want to deal with wired headphones while running. The product I have received came in original box with authenticity hologram attached to the arm.The short of it is that when it works it does the job great and sound quality is very good. Contrary to other reviewers I have a pretty comfortable fit. Pairing is also very easy. I like the button placement etc. I had it paired with both my laptop and a iPod nano wireless transmitter (i10s (Luxurious White) Tiny Bluetooth iPod Transmitter for iPod/iPhone/iPad/iTouch).I have a couple other Bluetooth headphones but they were not suitable for active sports. While this one does better job of staying on my head there is a big annoying problem with signal cut-offs. S9-HD frequently loose signal with the transmitter. I cannot keep the iPod reliably in my pocket. I have to hold it in my hand. I thought the issue was with my wireless transmitter but these headphones do the same with my laptop when I am sitting directly in front of the laptop and also my other Bluetooth headphones do not cut-off this frequently at such a short distance.Edit: The cut-offs seems to be less when both iPod and S9-HD are fully charged. When battery starts to drain over time (say an hour or so) the cut-offs become more often. Either the battery is too small or not fully charging fully (or both). Perhaps with a few more charge/discharge cycles the situation may improve. I'll update this review if I see an improvement.Edit2: The cut-offs are continuing after over a month use. It is such an annoyance and probably a flaw of this device as my other bluetooth devices does not have this problem. Unfortunately besides Motorola S9 and S10 the other Bluetooth headphones are not suitable for active sports.
2	This was a really nice phone when i had it. i kinda wished it was a smart phone but it was okay. It worked really well and everything. It dose not take drops really well. I doped  it when it would not work at all. i lost everything. :(
2	good charger but not a fast charger.  Arrived on time and does the job.
0	As soon as I plugged an item in...nothing happened. This does not work or connect solid enough to get my car's 250 PSI air compressor to work. (I tried to pump up the tire of my wheel barrow.) And yes the compressor works fine plugged in to my car's lighter.
2	It is okay but only works if you use it with something which requires very light current.  I got a new one replaced by them but that had the same issue.  This was being upsold along with Slime COMP02 12-Volt Tire Inflator  but never worked with it
2	Of course I wanted this to run an inflator to blow up mattresses and paddleboards.  No such luck.  Its not designed for that.  You might figure that out by reading the amp rating but I ask you: What is this thing good for if not for running an inflator?  What do you have that only has a 12volt plug that is 1 amp or less?
0	I got it so I could plug the Slime COMP02 12-Volt Tire Inflator in a wall socket but eventhough the little diode lights up it doesn't power the inflator !?Not recommended.
2	I purchased this in order to make my sirius xm radio for my car able to work in my house without buying all their fancy home kit set-up stuff but the darn thing wouldn't keep my radio on it would start for a quick second and then turn off again. I have no idea why and I am not electrical/computer wiz so I can't really comment if it was the voltage or what that caused this (even though I blamed the voltage in the subject line). I never tried this product with anything else like a car charger in the house or anything like that so I also can't comment on how it works for that but I do know it sadly didn't work for what I was hoping to accomplish. Aside from all that however the shipping and transaction and all that went very smoothly and I have no complaints there. :)
2	I have not tried all the various functions of this phone but it seems to work for everything I need it to do.  I don't like the round prongs power plug but I had an adapter since I have lived in Shanghai for the past several years. I think the user interface is simply horrible to use.  The various functions are needlessly buried in layers of senseless options.  Try to make a call to a company that says press 1 for English 2 for Spanish etc.  You have to press and hold the touch screen area called unlock. Then you have to press another area to get a touch screen numeral pad.  By the time you get to this point the number you called is asking you if you want to repeat the options. The microprocessor in this phone must be the slowest on earth. Everything is so slow and counterintuitive that I get upset everytime I use it. In text mode they use the same layout as a digital phone. Why they didn't have the option of a Qwerty keyboard is beyond logic.  So there you are pressing every button once twice or three times when it could have been a full keyboard layout. It does have the option where it tries to guess the word you are spelling which is good. The phone is usable but frustrating to use in my opinion.  I tried to give it to my brother but he returned it to me saying it has the worst user interface in the world and he wouldn't take it even if I paid him money.
2	For the price of the phone it's not a bad product at all. If you can afford something better I suggest buying a blackberry or an iPhone.
2	Got this for my husband a while ago and it's just ok. Not that user friendly and does weird things like showing a voice mail message when there isn't one. It's fine for the few times it's used though which is as a spare.
2	The LG KP500 is adequate if you are using it primarily for phone calls email Web browsing and text-messaging. However it does have a few problems/limitations:Touchscreen: This phone uses a resistive touchscreen as opposed to a capacitive touchscreen. The touchscreen isn't very responsive at times which is a real annoyance. (Capacitive touchscreens such as those on the iPhone and Blackberry Storm are more responsive and support multi-touch gestures.)Homescreen: You can only add/remove a predefined set of widgets on the Homescreen: Calendar Clock/Alarm Notes Music Player Picture Viewer Social Networking (My Space Twitter Facebook) and International Time.Single-Axis Accelerometer: The keyboard doesn't always change to a full QWERTY keyboard when you change the orientation of the phone from vertical to horizontal.Web Browser: Browsing the Web using the built-in Web Browser is a frustrating experience. The links on a page don't load at least half the time when you click on them. The page also takes a while to refresh after it's been scrolled. I downloaded and installed Opera Mini which works flawlessly.Email: The phone can store only 300 email messages. Once the capacity is reached you have to delete existing emails from the Inbox in order to retrieve more emails. Deleting emails is a hassle: you have to (1) select and delete emails from the Inbox (deleted emails are then placed in the Deleted folder) and (2) navigate to the Deleted folder and delete the emails again before they are finally expunged.Syncing With Outlook: I am able to sync with Outlook on my PC only through USB not bluetooth. I get a Pairing setting is failed while connecting with the device [sic] error message with bluetooth syncing. The To Do list is barely functional -- there is no way to sort it and the subject field is only about 14 characters wide. Calendar and To Do List are limited to 500 items.FM Radio: The FM Radio only works with the earbuds (included) plugged in. The earbuds use a proprietary LG connector not a standard 3.5mm audio plug. The sound from the earbuds is tinny.Camera & Video: The camera has no autofocus much less zoom capability. The camera is best used for close-up shots (distant objects are blurry). The video is very choppy because of the low frame rate (12 fps).---There you have it. The above are some important considerations you might want to take into account before making a purchase decision.
2	To it's credit LG makes a reliable product which had good organizational screens.  It's just a lower end model.  As a result I moved onto HTC for good unlocked service at a slightly higher price.
2	Beside the fact that this case adds bulk to an already bulky phone I find the back of the case REALLY difficult to remove when I want to change the battery.The case does fit well and I have no problem using the phone with the case on. It feels like a nice case especially for the price. I just didn't like the added bulk even though I kept the case on for protection. When I needed to change the battery (I carry extra charged battery for emergencies) it was SOOOO hard to remove the case I was afraid I'd break the phone. I decided not to put the case back on once I was able to get it off.
0	I'm not sure what is going on with all the high ratings but I was sent a flimsy plastic case that was painted poorly black on the outside and white on the inside - plastic as well. This will quickly scratch the phone and has nothing to prevent plastic-on-plastic scratching. Of course this is what you get for ~$8.00 (cost plus shipping) I suppose but you need to think twice before purchase if you want your $200 or $500 phone (depending on contract or not) scratched in days.By the way there is not a single thing rubber about this. Absolute false advertisement. I might have been sent the wrong item but the invoice and package do not indicate that.
2	This case was a little bulky. It seemed to protect the phone while it was on but I was also a little difficult to try and take off once the case was on the phone.
2	I also have a pod I use for an 8120 I purchased from a T-Mobile store and the finish on it is highly polished chrome. This pod does not have the same finish but a cheaper dull looking chrome. I found like other reviewers that the front Blackberry logo does not light up when your phone is inserted and charging. According to the Blackberry website it is supposed to. I suspect this is a knockoff. This pod is will charge your 8900.
2	There's nothing wrong with this charger there's just better options.  With as many devices as we all have to charge these days and the standardization to USB type chargers there's little reason any more to buy a unit like this one outlet taken up and it can only charge one device and it better be an old Samsung phone.  Once you replace your phone it becomes waste.  Better option if you still have one of those old Samsung phones to charge is to get a standard USB charger and buy one of the OEM type Samsung charging cables which can be had for only a few bucks and you can charge off any USB type charger buy three and keep one at your computer one in the car (half of the charging cords I buy now have extra usb outlets) and where ever it is your phone ends up laying for the night surely you have an extra USB charger laying around from some other obsolete piece you don't use any more.  USB outlets are almost everywhere even had some on a plane recently.
2	I bought this because of the name......Samsung but it doesn't he characteristics of a real Samsung product. The charger is flimsy and the cord is small unlike the unit that you get when you but a phone. Not worth it in my judgement.
2	If you search for Micro HDMI in the search this Mini HDMI is your top result. A little frustrating my own fault for not seeing that it was exactly what I was after but also that this is the top result for search that was for a micro not mini. On top of that I chose the one from SF planet who had a good rating and paid for standard shipping instead of the one that offered free super saver shipping  to get it a little faster on 6-14 and I still didn't get it until today 6-22. Not sure what I gained paying for the upgraded shipping. So I gave it a neutral 3 stars.
2	Not secure and does not fit my HTC EVO 4 phone. It seems small even for the G1 but I do not have one to test. I did not realize that there was closing system such as even a zipper. I knew there was no secure flap.
2	Spend the money on a better short cable. Yes the respectable cord is very nice but the quality of the connection is poor and wears out.
0	Bought one of these as a convenient way to charge and sync my Ipaq Glisten. While it will charge it simply won't connect to the computer via USB. Tried it with another phone and another computer. Still no joy. There are other similar products on the market that work. So buy one of those not this piece of garbage.
2	Ratchet failed after a few weeks. Bought another failed again. Also data communication is not reliable; became worse over time. zipcord ratchet was better but its data capacity also deteriorates over time. But both of these charge the phone just fine. Data communication works perfectly with a short non-retracting cable with Gold-plated plugs so I believe the cause of my problem is dust or cold solder on my laptop's USB socket. Wish I could find a retracting reliable (short is OK) gold plated cable.
2	USB cords just aren't able to survive in this kind of design. The cord worked for a few days but soon it started losing connection with my phone. Every few seconds the computer would drop it then find it again and repeat. It would charge the battery but I couldn't use it to transfer data once it got like this.
0	Cable connection is not good and will damage your devices.seems to charge ok but so does if you get a good cable and keep inserting-removing from the USB port... the phone will not even flash the charging state if you are fast enough and that's what happens with this cable. for data i keep get reconnects all the time to the point it's impossible to transfer one large file. which proves the connectivity and continuity in the cable or connectors sucks big time. tested 2 cables.No phone shows you micro disconnects on charging you may not even not it's flashing on and off.will not even bother returning. will probably use the spring mechanism for other cables i have around but this one i wouldn't use to connect to my expensive phones. at all.
2	It works but it's cheap.  Don't expect it to last long under constant use. It is what it is...but it works!
2	It works however is apain to use.  The cord is VERY short to be practicle I assumed the lenght would be standard NOT! It..is a hassle to use it you have to pull it soo tight then it comes out/unplugged ie with cp used as GPS et. Additionally  it gets tangled to rewind it  as short as it is.  Although it works I do not reccomend it.KarlaC
0	I have had this in my ownership 3 days.Today went to plug in my phone to the PC and POW!Spring over there 3 pieces of plastic broken over there.Yes the wire still works but it is NOT retractable anymore!THIS IS GARBAGE!
0	From the moment I got this product it was broken.  When you pull the cord out to extend it it's supposed to stay extended but it always snaps back into the retracted position.  This means I have to keep my phone one inch away from my PC to use it.  Wasn't worth the cost of shipping to get it replaced.  I suggest you purchase a slightly more expensive model with a push button lock to keep the cable extended.
0	I bought this item and it's competitor &#34;Micro USB Retractable Cable - Ideal for Any Micro USB...&#34;. The another one looks more durable. This one already broke while another one still works.
2	This product came in s small ziplok bag with only one set of ear buds in the picture and in the description it lists multiple sizes.  I bought 2 of these at the time I placed my order and neither had the various sizes of earbuds.  Other than that they fit ok and sound decent.
0	I honestly have to say this product had no quality it only lasted a week and one of the ear jacks already broke not to mention that they really don't stay too well in your ears in the first place
2	The product is good it just doesn't work for me. The little rubber fittings that go is the ear always slide out. Defeats the purpose of handsfree if I have to hold them in. When I looked at the product I couldn't tell this was the style. A better choice would have been made.
0	I have owned now 2 BB brand headsets and both failed (one side stops working).  I have now replaced it withAltec Lansing UHP326 Backbeat Series In Ear Headphone with Ultimate Ears technology.  It's more expensive at $30 but worth it!
2	I dont think this wrked very well for me.  People couldnt hear me too well.. Just good for listening to music
2	The sound quality of this earphones is good. But the design of the in-ear shape is not always that comfortable. You would feel pulling of your ears sometimes and the clip helps in this case. However the clip given has broken without any effort.The quality of the cord and sound quality is good for the price it is purchased. I would recommend it for its cord and sound quality.
2	I use a number of earbuds that fit in the ear like this. The others don't bother me but this one does.Otherwise it works fine.
0	This headset sucked and for the price it just annoyed me to pay that much to get a cruddy result. I lost lots of calls and no one could her me...awful.
2	I've owned the BlueParrott B250-XT headset for 13 months.  The headset has stopped working.  It charges but will not turn on.  Tech Support just told me very nicely that I was one month out of warranty but they would repair it for $55 plus postage.  Considering I paid just $71 for it new that seems like a rip-off to me.On the other hand the headset is very comfortable to wear for long periods of time has excellent sound quality and volume on both ends and holds a charge really well.  I.e. this was a really great headset while it lasted.I may grit my teeth and just get another one of these or I may switch to something else. My brand loyalty which was high until now is at low ebb.
2	Purchased these or my husband as he does not like the in-ear Bluetooth headsets.  It s comfortable to wear however it has trouble maintaining the Bluetooth connection to his iPhone 4S.  We have to pair it quite often and that is annoying to say the least.  I am somewhat disappointed as the reviews seemed pretty good for this unit.  When it won't pair he ends up holding the phone which makes me crazy as I refuse to drive and talk holding a phone.  I am guessing that I need to find him a better solution.  Money wasted!
2	The headset tends to get confused sometimes then you have to wait til it dies before it will reset. Main issue I have is the buttons too close together easy to do something inadvertent. Audio is not great I have trouble hearing anyone without a perfect connection my blueant in-ear is much better.
2	I'm totally convinced that this bluetooth headset from VXI BlueParrot Roadwarrior wasn't a good choice. It hasn't a very good noise cancellation and its clarity isn't a great new. I tried another product.
0	It worked great for 2 weeks but now it disconnects about 5 minutes into a call. I don't know why. I reset it reset the phone re-paired the headset did what I could but it's useless now. Returning it.Also the head band is a bit too tight -- gave me a headache but I was willing to live with that for the clarity. Oh well.
2	I don't know what has changed in the last 2 or 3 years with blue parrot but these do not live up the the originals.
2	Each headset is great while it works. Expect to buy a new one every year because even with ginger usage of the item it will break and it will break right after the Warranty expires. BlueParrott Customer Service is CRAP. Even when in warenty they refuse to tell you where to ship it back for repair/replacement and it was pulling teeth to the point where I gave up and threw the damn thing out.
2	My first review for this phone was 4 stars.  After using it for a few weeks now I feel I have to reevaluate and drop a star after encountering a growing problem with the trackball.I used the 8700g Blackberry for several years.  It was probably the last BB model that came with a trackwheel on the side instead of the trackball on the front.  Over the years the wheel never malfunctioned.  It was rock solid.  Of course it was also very ineffective at moving around the screen.  RIM obviously had to come up with a better way.Like all mechanical mouses the BB trackball will get dirt and dust underneath on the mechanical parts which causes problems with moving the cursor.  My google search indicated that this problem has popped up on probably every single BB made.After using the phone for a few weeks I have noticed that the downward motion is now much slower.  Left right and up are OK for now but those are also directions I use the least.  The downward motion is what a user would use to scroll quickly through an email or read a web site.  At this rate I'm going to assume that within 90 days I'm probably going to have to have the phone fixed or find out how to remove the outer casing to clean the trackball myself.  There are online instructions for other BB models but I've yet to find anything about the 8900.  I'm going to be really annoyed if it's not possible on the user side to fix this problem.Now on to the other pros and cons . . .ProsNew OS/interface is more stable and offers more featuresPhone is probably the smallest BB with a full keyboard.  A welcome change after using the 8700g a model about twice the size in total volumeCamera has been upped to 3.2mp and comes with a flash.  Also has a video function although I haven't tested that yet.Accepts Micro SD cards allowing you to have a full fledged MP3 player.  I put a class six 8gb card in mine for about $30ConsAs stated the trackball!Back cover is a bit flimsyRIM doesn't provide enough themes with the OS and finding others (the much needed Today theme for example) is far more difficult than in the past.  You can get extra themes but currently (as of early 2009) you will have to look hard for them as RIM isn't currently listing them on their online source page.Phone is actually slower at loading at some web sites than the 8700g on some networks.  The phone has a 2x faster processor.  T-Mobile needs to start thinking about moving on to 3G soon.RIM changed the power cord to micro USB.  The size difference is tiny but it now forces users to buy new accessories (e.g. car chargers).  No excuse for this.The 8900 is a great phone to use.  It's an improvement over the earlier Curve and it's a few light years ahead of the old 8700g.  But the possible deal breaker for me is that trackball.  That the problem popped up so quickly and is such a common problem along the entire BB product line angers me more.  RIM should have come up with a solution for this by now.
2	not sure again why i bought this product. thought i needed it but turned out just to be i just needed a phone upgrade. LOL
0	These are not made to be used everyday with a phone that gets lots of use. It will work for a while then once the wire gets bent it will split.
2	I was looking for an adapter that I can use with my Nokia E66 cell phone for regular earphones (3.5 mm plug). If I fully plug it into the cell phone the sound is mono but if the plug goes almost all the way into the cell phone I get the stereo sound.So the adapter doesn't work as described but I had to find a way to make it work.
2	It doesn't work on a lot of phones....And I don't know why.  Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.  Kind of disappointing.
2	it's an htc original adapter. it works great except that stupid behavior of my mytouch 3g when i plug it in the music player launches automatically and mutes the microphone if it happens during a call. it returns back every time i exit it very annoying for me. the device could be a nice adapter if it was smaller and does not cause launching the music player.
2	not really sure why i bought it. I think i bought it for a friend but she already got one by the time this came in still in packaging.
0	Cannot get audio out from the 3.5 connection. I tried several standard headphones. More so when plugged in the phone starts auto-dialing last dialed numbered.I spent quite a lot of time trying to understand how I can make it work. Searching and reading over the Web taught me that it is no slam dunk. 2.5 and 3.5 connectors can be wired in a number of different ways and support mono stereo mic etc. There are plugs with 1 2 and 3 rings (respectively with 2 3 and 4 connectors - the connector is the metal part between the rings).However this is HTC part meant to work with my HTC Mogul Sprint phone - and it doesn't. My conclusion so far is that this adapter came with some short of a defect or a 'short' in its wiring though my empirical tests are not conclusive. For example I can get mono audio out by plugging in a telephone headset into the 2.5 connection. The weird thing is that if I plug my stereo standard 3.5 headphone into that same connection (using another 2.5 to 3.5 adapter) I do not get audio.After many frustrating hours I came up with one workaround that works - plug an earphone into the proprietary port and check for sound then plug another one in the 2.5 and test and then plug -slowly- the 3.5 in - this gets me audio out and then I can unplug the other two.I just returned mine and ordered another from the same vendor. I hope the part was defective; I shudder to think that is how it is supposed to work or that there is a problem with the phone itself.
2	Purchase the Ten One Design Pogo Sketch Stylus for iPad iPhone and iPod touch because I didn't like the smudges I left on my phone & iPad screens when I would you my fingers to navigate the games programs etc. It works as described but I wished it was more pointed to be able to draw fine lines when using the drawing apps.  Also after a while the tip of the stylus would wear out which is not good.
0	I was fairly excited to hear about this product. While I do find the iPhone screen simple to use I thought I could get some extra finesse with this thing.Well finess is one thing it does not have. It is very light - and there is a sort of conductive foam tip. This foam tip seems quite flimsy and I have no confidence it will remain attached for very long. The whole thing is put together with perhaps 20 cents worth of stuff - and they have the gall to charge $15 or more for it.So - to the function:It take a great deal more effort to effect the screen than your finger alone. The screen really does not read it well - and you have to push far harder than I am comfortable doing.The screen does recognize it - eventually - but really - it's flimsy tip is the problem in my mind.Overall - not worth the effort or the $$ - fingers are free and work far better on the iPhone or iPod touch. Get a nice screen protector and you will be far happier.
2	I bought this to use it with my iPad as I have purchased several apps including one hand writing recognition app. I thought it would be nice to have a stylus to use. Well the stylus really does not work well for writing. I found that my finger is just as reliable. The Pogo Sketch has a thick tip on it and it really feels like you are writing with a crayon on a piece of paper. You really can't write small or neatly. Because I get the same result using my finger as I do the pogo sketch I figure I might as well save myself the trouble and not have to worry about losing the pogo sketch.So for writing this really doesn't work that well. For tapping icons it is good for drawing it's pretty good and I've seen some incredible pieces of art come out of using it.I was hoping it would be like the old palm stylus fine point and really easy to do text entry. This is far from it. Imagine using a crayon to write to get an idea of how big the point is.
2	If you're looking for improved handwriting this may help you...a little. I bought this for my iPad thinking that it would help with a handwriting note app that I purchased. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the pen.  It's a metal rod with a glued on foam tip.  It does help with handwriting (anything is better than a fingertip) but it lacks a fine point that is needed to accurately draw and write.For note taking I will likely continue to use the onscreen keyboard and the Evernote app instead of the pen . The handwriting capability with a pen/stylus just isn't there yet.  I expected better results.  I'll still use the pen for point and click stuff.  I don't think it's worth the $10 I paid for it. Maybe $5 maybe.
2	These were ok. I ended up washing them so I no longer have them. But they were ok though. Not bad.. but could always be better though.
2	Nice headphones wireless and lightweight.  But the short live time of the battery makes them pretty much useless.  I get two hours maximum.  Then I need to recharge them which takes another two hours.  Wireless headphones need to be able to work for at least 8 hours to be useful.
2	Gripes: 1. does not hold a charge for very long (maybe 3 hours of continuous use max) 2. proprietary charger so can't use an available usb - have to carry around the ac charger or purchase their car charger. 3. no on/off button so battery will run down while not in use but will disconnect itself from bt when not used for a short time - 50% of the time will easily reconnect the other half it will take many tries to get it reconnected (might be a phone issue - galaxy nexus).  has trouble connecting to phone sometimes which is usually solved by turning off bt on phone then back on then reconnecting (might also be phone issue). 4. doesn't hold charge in standy - Fully charged but unused for a day then used for an hour before it died. But charge holding has improved a bit over time. (haven't had a repeat of the one hour issue)  5. starts to drop out if more than 10 ft from phone 6. rubber ear bud covers sometimes come off when you're not looking (have permanently lost one so far)Likes: Keeps connection well with only occasional hiccoughs. Ear pieces could be smaller but they're ok stays in ears well. they are nice and light to wear. sturdy - they've been banged around quite a bit and no problems. phone calls sound fine on my end and I've had few complaints from others. had issue with no indicator lights called tech support and mostly resolved by resetting the headset but still no on/off indication.
2	I bought this for my wife to go along with her Creative Zen M300 4GB player. The concept is great.  Small light weight headphones that are bluetooth.  We had problems right away.  It was a pain to connect earbuds to mp3 player because the lights on the earbuds were not doing what the instructions were saying.  I started playing around with it and after an hour figured out what the lights on the earbuds were indicating.  The earbuds hold the battery that you recharge. You pull back the flap on the back of one of them and you plug in the charger.  Even though my wife has small hands she struggled with getting the plug into the earbuds.  This caused a lot of frustration and the back of the earbud eventually broke exposing the charge port on the earbud to moisture from my wife's workouts and it eventually stopped charging.  The sound quality was not very good.  As for battery life expect 2-3 hours with normal volume. I have low expectations of bluetooth in general and these were worse than what I could tolerate. I read reviews where folks had great success. Unfortunately we weren't one of those couples that had great success with these.
2	Only one earbud worked on my first pair. Thank you Amazon returns! I've used my second pair for over a month. They sound great and work well indoors. My problem is walking to the train and from the train to my building. The signal cuts off every time I move my head. I keep the phone in the breast pocket of my jacket and I keep loosing signal. If it weren't for this they would be a great pair of blue tooth headphones.
2	After 4 months of moderate use it stopped working.  After many customer service hours and phone lines I found out that they no longer back this product.  If it breaks you're on your own.
0	I bought this thing to replace a Samsung that sounded great but was a little clunky. I was immediately dissapointed by the charger that was clearly designed for some other item and kind-of-half-way attaches to one earphone. It's not a micro-USB type but something that must be plugged into the wall--NOT your 2 USB car charger next to your phone. The actual headset was remarkably sleek so I kept an open mind during the eight-hour initial charging session. I was again dissapointed at once by the flat tinny sound that finally came through the stylish and lightweight headset when I finally played the new coldplay album from my Android phone. I am no audiophile but the sound from these earbuds was really really noticeably poor compared to the Samsung they replaced. If you like heavy deep base you are really in for a let-down. In summary it looks cool it's functional I'll wear it to the gym but it sounds substandard.UPDATE:Downgraded to one star. After listening to these earphones for an hour I decided that the sound quality was unacceptably poor. Fortunately Amazon has a fantastic way of handling returns and I was able to print a return authorization and shipping label--postage included--for a full refund. My first return experience with Amazon will make me less hesitant to purchase items online and more likely to choose Amazon over other sellers.
0	This headset died in 2 months just after the warranty expired.I took a look at the online forums and it seems that I may have bought a &#34;knock off&#34;. I'm no expert on supposedly original devices but I would've expected to be original if purchased from Amazon.Anyway do yourself a favor and buy the LG headset. It's durable has a battery indicator and it doesn't die on you after some light use.
2	They're definitely ear plugs.  I use them primarily for jogging so to get them to stick in my ears I really have to dig them into my ear holes.  The connection isn't that great so I usually have to carry my phone in my hand instead of using a shoulder strap (I don't know why).  I wish they came with some hook that you could hook it around your ears or something so they'd stay up better.
0	Sony does not seem to care for customer needs. They once again are behaving stubbornly with just another proprietary charger instead of simply using the universal usb that most serious companies use. Why do they want to force us to carry another charger?When is Sony going to care about customer needs instead of just thinking how to extract a few more pennies from us?
2	While this headset is unique and quite sleek I can't say too many positive things about this.  Here are the list of reasons why this headset is terrible:1) Fidelity - The sound quality was on par with a set of Coby earbuds all mids and no highs or lows.  I had the earpiece properly inserted into my ear sounds horrible.  Don't understand why some reviewers are saying the sounds are great it truly lacks bandwidth and frequency response.2) Charging - Looks like the &#34;charger&#34; was an after thought or their attempt at recycling old stock.  You get this whacky what I guess is a cell phone charger but only a few pins on the charging are used so only one &#34;latch&#34; out of two of the connector on the charger-side is used.  The charger looks Mickey-Moused.3) Lack of Volume and Next Track/Previous Track - Ok no volume control I can deal with no skip track or previous track?  That renders it unusable.  A while ago I figured out that making playlists were really a waste of time so I like to randomize my entire mp3 library on my iphone.  No next track/previous track means I have to whip out the phone.  The default corded iphone earbud with remote allows me to skip to next track adjust volume without having to whip out my phone.  This feature is what garners this product a two-star.4) Wrong Material Choice?  The rubber on the ear bud fittings are of chalky &#34;dry&#34; feeling rubber as such it will not grip the inside of your ear.  The slightest movement will make the ear bud fittings work itself out of your ear.  I miss my AcoustiBuds by Burton Technology.  They seemed to have gotten this part right why can't a corporate giant like Sony/Ericsson get a simple material selection?  Did they not test it?  Did they test it on their own moist ear and said &#34;good enough&#34; and called it a day?  This is a piss poor selection of material these in-ear buds have been around since they started handing out headsets on airplanes some 30 years ago.  With today's wider selection of all sorts of exotic rubbers they couldn't get this little detail correct?5) The remote (if you can call it that) seriously is in a wrong place.  It's too high up.  I think this length was design for people with shorter necks.  It just wasn't well thought out.6)  Accessories that came with this earbud - the little clip that came with it is a joke and removing the clip damaged the insulation on the wires.  The protective bag is just a cheap cloth bag you find in gimmicky audio accessories from generic manfacturers.What ever happened to Sony?  This brand has really gone down the drain.  Their TV sets suck their audio accessories suck their video game console sucks everything from this company as of late really sucks.  This company is a joke.  And partnering/absorbing/merging with another dying company like Ericsson isn't really helping Sony developing good products at all...
0	I am by no means an audiophile - but for people to say these have good sound is crazy - I was so excited when my iphone got the 3.0 update because I thought for sure that stereo bluetooth had finally evolved (based on these reviews) --my first experience was with the motorola s9 - which sounded crappy too.  These look awesome out of the box - but the sound quality was terrible - now these are songs that I have purchased from itunes if that makes a differnece -- but the sound made these basically unusable -- as I have found with previous BT stereo headsets - oh well -I guess I 'll keep waiting.
2	The charger itself works fine but the short cable is limiting and the way the charger's USB port is recessed means that very few other USB cables can plug into it.
2	Randomly my phone will stop charging then start back causing the screen to go on and off constantly. This probably isn't that big of a deal but I can't imagine it is very efficient because it is not charging half the time. I think it is the part that plugs in that is causing this issue not the cable.
2	Update: As of 2010-10-14 Motorola S305 headphones are available at a price that is approximately the same as these Sony 'phones. There is now no reason to choose Sony. The Moto 'phones are equal or better in every aspect. In particular the Moto 'phones stay on your head easily.These headphones offer good performance for the price. As other reviewers have noted there are significant problems with this gadget. I suggest a work-around for some of these problems.Sound quality: not great. I have a pair of Sennheiser PMX60 mini-headphones that have better bass and a more detailed sound. But these little Sennheisers are about the same prices as the Sonys: http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PMX-60-PMX60-Headphones/dp/B00009LI55/ref=sr_1_45?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1264384037&sr;=1-45.Construction: these headphones are built light. They are suitable for doing chores around the house brisk walks and so forth. For use during all out exercise with sweat and motion I'm just not sure.Fit: as other reviewers have noted these 'phones fit the head very loosely. tilt your head forward and they will slide right off. There is a related issue too. The drivers inside those big fat foam pads are tiny. You must position the drivers precisely over your ear canals or the sound will be worse than not great. It will be terrible.My suggestion: in light of the above issues with fit and positioning I recommend the use of a jury-rigged leash to hold the headphones securely on the head of the user. Such a leash fits the back of ones head. I fashioned my leash out of a cut-up Croakies eyewear retainer. I uploaded two photos to this review to illustrate my work such as it is. I have used this idea with other headphones and I have had good results in all cases.Compatibility and stability: I have paired these headphones with three devices. The pairing process was effortless. These 'phones work well with my Motorola cell phone my iPod Touch and my notebook computer. In fact I have used these 'phones with my cell phone and iPod at the same time. Listening to music when a phone call comes in I can touch one button on the 'phones to answer. Very convenient! With the notebook computer I can use the controls on the 'phones to do pause/resume skip forward/skip reverse and volume up/volume down. With the iPod Touch I can do all of these except skip forward/skip reverse. By the way you cannot use the microphone function with the iPod Touch either. Just Apple being Apple I guess.On the subject of iPod here is a trouble-shooting tip: while listening to music with my iPod Touch I encounter frequent dropouts. What happens is that the sound ceases for about one half of a second. It is irritating and it happens to me several times per hour of use. The solution is to disable WiFi on the iPod Touch. It seems that the iPod bluetooth and WiFi radios have trouble working together. The dropout problem is especially bad if the WiFi signal is weak. It seems obvious to me that this is an iPod problem not a Sony headphone problem.Value: these are the only stereo bluetooth headphones I can find that are fit to purpose AND less than $100. Sony also gives you a telephone quality microphone. In fact I got these for a lot less than $100 so I consider this to be an excellent value. Frankly I wish that there were more choices in the marketplace. No matter. The marketplace is what it is and this product is the best deal that I could find.I suppose that I have presented a rather conflicted view of this product but I am getting a lot of enjoyment out of it. I like to wear it while doing chores around the house. With conventional wired headphones I have issues with my arms getting tangled in the headphone leads and pulling the 'phones or music player out of place. These Sony headphones are much more pleasant to use.
2	These haedphones work fairly well sound quality is fair getting them to be recognized was very easy.  Overall OK for the money spent.  I understand they also have a built in mic so you can talk calls with them - not interested in this aspect.
2	These headphones work as they're supposed to but the fit is so poor it's weird. Despite the fact that the cups are large they seem to touch you only in the middle and the whole affair is so loose that it becomes a balancing act to keep them in place.Unfortunately there's ain't much choice on the market for headphones with discreet mike that go over the head. I'd happily pay more if there were an alternative.
2	I had read plenty of reviews of wireless headsets.  I really wanted a headset that I could wear in the gym and be active in while still listening to my music.  I've had terrible luck with arm bands in the gym.  So I thought I'd give this a try.  I've already gone through a Motorola headset that died after two weeks.  The reviews on the Sony are positive so I thought I'd try it.This headset works quite well. The base unit is smaller than about the size of a man's thumb in my estimation.  The unit comes with a few different ear buds to switch out.  The cords do get tangled easily though.  Then again most headsets have that problem.  The unit paired in seconds charged well and keeps a decent charge.  On some of my songs the sound is somewhat tinny but still good.Usage is a bit odd.  The cords are not long enough so that you could clip it to the end of a sleeve.  And if you wear it in the gym you'll have to clip it to your collar of your shirt.  And this is a bit odd.  Basically you'll have a thumb sized bulge on or under your shirt at neck level.  I've gotten a few stares because it looks weird.  Then again while running on the treadmill it's super convenient.The iPhone is the bummer since it doesn't support the full volume control and track skipping.  But this unit works just fine beyond that.  I'm very happy with it.Update:  I must have doomed the stupid thing.  Minutes after I wrote this review the unit won't power on any more.  I have no idea what happened but it's dead.  Thankfully it's under 30 days so I'm returning it.  Downgrading my rating to two stars.  The price is fine just a shame that it might not be that sturdy.
2	It's been a while since I looked at the reviews but someone commented on the device having a wire kind of takes away from it being blutooth and they are 100% correct.Pros1. The device has really good sound quality.2. The device if very comfortable to wear.  My other blutooth stereo headset is a Motorola S9 and isn't that comfortable and frankly starts to hurt quickly.Cons1. I hate the wire.  PERIOD...a. It's not really long enough to clip onto belt or pocket and I'm an average size man of 5'10.  Isn't long enough to clip to end of long sleeve or even go in jacket pocket.b. The clip doesn't isn't that great to clip to shirt (if you clip to chest like t-shirt with no pocket).  Doesn't clip well to collar because the end control piece is too heavy or bulky around one's neck.c. The actually controls are upside down.  Look at the device picture..  If you were to put the earbuds in and hold the device in front of you the cable points up.  It should go down.  If it could clip to belt which it doesn't reach it would be upright but IF you had to read it then it's upside down to your view.  Like the person looking at me needs to be able to read it.  (not)d. frankly..  Any amount of cable means that the thing might as well just plug into my phone.  I'm not sure how I'd make it better but I guess I'd rather have a self contained headset that is only on my head.  But like I said before the Motorola S9 isn't that comfortable and doesn't sound near as good as this Sony.
2	I went through two of these thinking I had a bad headset.  It wasn't the headset.I paired this headset to my iPhone & Macbook.  It is an in-ear design meaning the earbud goes in the ear canal and creates a seal to isolate outside sound.  I like this design but its not ideal for all situations (ie. jogging or whenever you need to pay some attention to things like oncoming traffic).The clip is weak.  If you attach this to your shirt and go jogging it can ride up and fall down.The forward/reverse next song buttons do not work with the iPhone but did work with the Palm Pre.  Volume buttons does work but does not control the iPhone's bluetooth volume.Sound quality on the iPhone and Mac is bad.  It sounds like it cannot handle the treble and makes it sound scratchy.  I got this on two different headsets.  It could be Apple's bluetooth drivers causing this.  I even changed the audio settings on the iPhone with no luck.  I paired this to my brothers Palm Pre and it sounded great (for bluetooth headset).Overall I'm not terribly dissappointed but I wish I waited for a better price...
2	I didn't have any use for this item after I received it so I returned it. Not a bad product I just didn't want it.
2	All buttons work and functions normally however there were several scratches and paint chipping. It feels quite old and very used.
0	A total waste of time. Folks learn the hard lesson I've learned ONLY order items frm PRIME certified sellers. Ohterwise you dont know what youre getting spending your money like going to Vegas. Its a gamble.
0	Battery came quickly and in good condition.  It's in my cell and  seems to be working fine.  The true test will be this next week while I'm at work.  So far so good and it looks like I would purchase from them again in the future.  Will update next week.
0	I purchase this battery as a spare for my blackberry phone.  When I placed the battery in the phone it didn't even recognize it.  I plugged in the charger and the light continued to be red for over two hours. I have sinced moved and lost it which is great because I still have the phone with the original battery that works fine. Don't buy this it's a waste of good money.
0	Refurbished I believe. Terrible batteries. If your going to buy these I would recommend buying at least 3... I only bought 1. It didn't work. As soon as I got the package I swapped batteries with my old one in my blackberry. I charged it for about 3 hours before checking the battery level. It was stuck at 90%... when I unplugged my phone from the wall chargerthe battery died within 30 minutes. It doesn't hold a charge. Wow. $7 is too good to be true for a good battery. ($7.00 is with shipping.)
2	ThisBlackberry Standard Lithium-ion Replacement Battery C-S2is listed as being for the Blackberry 8330 8310 8320 and 8300 Curve Smartphone but with that C-S2 designation it's also the replacement for the BlackBerry Curve 9330. Bought this because my original C-S2 battery and a backup of the same were failing.The original that came with the phone is listed at 1150mAh and is supposed to have a talk time of three hours with a standby time of 1 days. When my talk time had hit under an hour and standby time was less than a day it was time to replace it. Since the BlackBerry C-S2 battery has a cryptographic chip to ensure you're using the right one for the particular BlackBerry smartphone you have it should either work or be a dud.And when I received this battery it was a dud.But going back to the original documentation for these the BlackBerry C-S2 battery requires a full 8-hour or longer charge before it can be used so I charged this one. That did the trick... to some degree.This replacement has never been quite up to the talk time of the original when it was new but at about 2 hours it wasn't worth sending back so I've kept it. This one is better than another that I picked up here from another vendor so it was better to hold onto one that worked as opposed to one that didn't.Your experiences may be different and from some of the reviews posted here that seems to be the case. If I planned on keeping my 9330 Curve for a few more years I might have complained but there are other smartphones that get better life (and performance) today so this one is at least a solution that keeps it going for now.If you get one of theseBlackberry Standard Lithium-ion Replacement Battery C-S2packs here my only suggestion is that you charge it for 8-12 hours before you use it. For me it was a gamble that worked... somewhat.10/25/2012
2	Very little money for this item. If you have family members who constantly loose or break phone chargers then get yourself 3 or 4 of these as a backup. The day that they arrive my son came to me needed yet another charger. What a surprise!!
2	I purchased this product through Amazon (from Seller1ON1) to power a variety of devices including an HTC cell phone all which require power from a micro-USB cable.Exclusive of the cables the five chargers I purchased all worked well and were within their stated specification. They are rated at 5.1V and 0.7A.  For each I measured their output at 5.1V open circuit 5.0 to 5.05V at 700 to 830 mA and dropping to 4.1-4.4 V at about 850mA.  While many low cost chargers sold here are counterfeit items these chargers (at least the ones I got) are not they are the real thing.However some of the cables provided were not reliable.  The cable that's supplied with the charger (LG cable part number SGDY0014303) connects to the charger using a standard USB Type A connector at one end and at the other end connects to the phone using a micro-USB connector which is fast becoming the standard for cell phone power.I purchased five sets of chargers and cables and found that three of the five cables were bad.  Let me describe the bad ones:I haven't used the cables with an LG phone but using them with several other devices and phones I found that the micro-USB connector was often intermittent.  There is a fair amount of play when the connector is plugged in and if it wiggles just a little bit the power connection is lost.I microscopically compared that male micro-USB connector with others that I have on better cables. See the photo I posted of both good and bad connectors.The better cables have connectors that are far superior.  The connector on the three bad SGDY0014303 cables have metal contacts that have very little compliance so that only when the connector is plugged into the receptical perfectly does it make a good connection.  If the array of metal contacts are not perfectly coplanar with the corresponding contacts in the receptical contact is easily lost.  Further the hole in the connector was a bit too large making the connector fit loosely.  When I examine the micro-USB male connectors of the other cables I have I see that their contacts are made of a much larger bent metal spring that is more forgiving of misalignment -- it continues to make contact no matter how much the connector is wiggled in the receptical and the connection is much tighter overall.I find that when I charge my HTC phone using the bad cables I have to be very careful to make sure the connector is actually making contact and adjust it if it is not so the phone charges.The other two cables are constructed a little differently and work fine.  All five cables are marked identically with LG logos that look the same.  Further the wire gauge and the plastic housing material looks the same.  Even so examining the connectors under a microscope shows that I actually received three differently designed micro-USB connectors.  Two of the designs work well but the third design present on three cables is faulty by design.For me this charger is a great deal but beware of unreliable cables!
0	This is apparently a listing error by Amazon. They do happen and they can persist for some time.The cable measures 33 inches long that's not even 1 meter much less than 1.5 meter.I have no quarrel with the Amazon Marketplace vendor whom I bought from or Amazon. Mistakes happen.However if you need a 1.5m (65 inch) cable as I do this just won't do.Yes the cable does work but it is not what is described what I ordered or what I thought I was getting. Thus 1 star: the product described is not the product you get.Jerry
0	Should read 1.0m not 1.5m.  I got the cable and it clearly showed (on the bag holding the cable)that it was 1.0m.  I contacted the vendor to ask what to do and they told me to check with Blackberry on why they switched the cable on the vendor.  If I were you I wouldn't touch this product or work with this vendor.
0	It's a pity. This worked fine until I got the 1.5 cupcake update to my G1 phone. Now it is not recognized by the phone so it's useless.
0	It will charge with a car charger and work with a cd player that has an 3.5mm aux outlet on it at the same time. You just have to buy a male/male audio chord and plug that into the HTC headphone jack wire that comes with your phone. But if you are looking at using the 3.5mm jack on the adapter then this is going to be useless. Your phone won't recognize the after market headphones that is plugged into it unless you buy the Sound Route Switcher on the app market.Overall it works great for roadtrips but not good for taking on a walk or jogging. The adapter will just add more weight to your phone.
2	I've owned the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic since July 2009. Prior to the Nokia 5800 I had an old Nokia from 2005. I bought this because it had a decent video camera/camera(compared to my old Nokia) and the ability to browse the internet(my old Nokia could barely perform that function). After a year and a half the results are mixed.The video cam is convenient to use but the results are just ok. In broad daylight the picture is clear. But in any other lighting condition degradation is rapid. Browsing the internet isn't that smooth because the 5800's touch-screen is either overly sensitive sometimes or it just takes a slegdehammer to register an input. This results in many mis-clicks which waste time and mobile bandwidth.The audio quality of the phone is pretty good. The switching function between horizontal and vertical screen is eratic and seems to switch to horizontal when I want it vertical and vertical when I need it horizontal so I just turn off the auto-turn feature. Unfortunately there is no option to switch. Either it is stationary or it turns eratically on its own.With the updates the phone functions a little smoother. Originally there is the full/mini QWERTY keyboard along with handwriting now with the update there is an alphanumeric keypad. The build-quality of the phone feels nice but it is a bit bulky and the little writing tool can easily get lost. Reception is always strong with this phone. Overall a decent phone that's a bit pricey and can be frustrating to use.
2	I Got this Phone yesterday and i`m returning it.The phone is just OK. and the sound Quality is the worst ever.It does not  worth the high price.I Cant Recommend this Phone.And I`ve had bad times with Nokia Phones.UPDATE:Before you buy this phone Google Create New Server Profile Nokia 5800.This is a Common Problem And Nokia Has no Answer For this.
0	This phone connected to the internet via WiFi yet gave me so many freezing problems both on and off the internet. I ended up with the Nokia 5530 and have had no freezing problems and am very happy with that phone. I cannot recommend the Nokia 5800 because of the freezing problems. And I did think the 5800 was a very pretty phone with big screen had it not been for those freezing problems...Oh well life goes on! Glad now I own the Nokia 5530!
2	I was sorry to see that what could have really given the iPhone a run for its money is actually trailing...Here is what I liked:1) Great sound! For a phone the full body sound from its stereo speakers was amazing! Great for music and as a speaker-phone.2) The size - fits very nicely in the hand. Body is plastic - but feels solid.3) Fastest GPS initialization I have ever seen in a portable 'period' let alone a phone-gps!4) Great video playback.5) Loved the handwriting recognition.Here are my dislikes:1) The Phone user interface is lacking. Especially if you use systems that require DTMF tones to operate. There were several occasions when even after getting the soft dialer on the screen the digits did not send out the tones - on other occasions it did - I was not able to figure out what I was doing differently to get consistent behavior. The phone had to go back because of this.2) Applications just suck up power - if you use the phone for more than th e phone you'll run short.3) Application hangups - podcasts downloaded caused the media player to get stuck. Had to cycle power to restore.4) Email application does not support HTML.5) No flash player6) WiFi selection is stupid... it does not automatically pick known wifi when in its proximity...7) Feels the phone could use more horsepower.I'm waiting for the N97...Cheers!
2	For a first &#34;smart phone&#34; it's okay.Little too thick but it's an old model.Nokia OS it's crap and slow.  Small keyboard.Signal is great internet navigation kind of crapy.
2	JANUARY 2010 UPDATE:  After having used the Nokia for a week decided on returning it because of the short battery life and then even with an updated firmware the screen became unresponsive needing turning off and on again the device in order to use the phone features.  As much as I like Nokia they still have a long way to go with touch screens.INITIAL REVIEW: After one year using a Nokia E-71 which I dropped and stopped working I searched for a replacement and found this XpressMusic5800 for $219.00 OnLine.  Ordered it from the blue computer store and have been playing with it for only 24 hours.  Nevertheless being a recently introduced device in the US thought on sharing my first impression for those who are considering it.Users familiar with Nokia products will love how user friendly this phone is.  Those unfamiliar with Nokia might have a hard time setting up the many phone's features but it's worth your time.  Once you open the box will find a device much smaller than what you thought it would be.  The most attractive thing is how narrow it is.  Slightly shorter than an I-Phone and E-71 much narrower than both but somewhat thicker; a tad more than half inch.  Included is a wired remote control for the player mic/headphones the wall charger strap MicroSD card and a mini disk for installing the Nokia features.On the upper part of the device there is a micro USB dock the port for the regular headset the charging port and the on/off switch. On the right side there is a volume switch the unlocking switch and a separate camera switch.  The left side houses an 8GB MicroSD card (included) and the SIM Card from your phone carrier.  The expected Nokia strap hooks on the lower left side of the phone.  The battery is on the back facing downwards and to access it you need to remove the whole back cover.  The phone comes in shiny black which is a fingerprints magnet.When you turn it on it vibrates shows the usual Nokia welcome and then allows you to program it.  I was able to configure my two main e-mails but guess you can do several more.  On my E-71 I had four different mail accounts constantly receiving messages.  The native wallpaper is black with some waves but you can easily change it to your favorite photo.  I downloaded several screens from the Apple website since the screen is somewhat similar to the I-Phone and I-Pod in shape and dimensions.On a very T-Mobile way you can have your four favorite people on the main screen and once you touch their corresponding picture/icon the phone shows a history of calls made received text messages and e-mails; quite innovative.  On the lower area you have an icon for phone dialing and another for your contacts.  The phone dialing keyboard works only in the vertical position but the font keyboard is accessed also while the device is horizontal.  Making a call trough the contact list is very easy the device is loaded with features.Call quality is excellent and even at its loudest setting there is no distortion.  The touch sensing screen is not as fast and accurate as the Apple devices but good enough for not needing the stylus that is housed on the rear of the phone.  As a music player it is outstanding.  Playback is trough the two micro speakers on the lower sides and sound quality as well as stereo separation are very good.  Nokia offers on this device all the goodies that make them unique such as saying the caller's name/ID unique caller ringtones & photos and several customizable user modes. There are many features that I have not yet tried but will do during the next week or so.  My service is with ATT and works in both frequencies; EDGE & 3-GNow the limitations of the Nokia 5800:First; the battery life.  Nokia products have been famous for their extended batteries.  My E-71 could be used without recharging up to three days.  On the 5800 the battery drains in six hours. The stated four hours of talk time and two weeks of standby time are far from reasonable.What I did to prolong battery life was disable the vibrations when the screen gets a command disable the 3-G (use EDGE only) and made the Bluetooth available for search for only one minute.  As of today with regular calls internet use e-mails and music after 15 hours of nonstop use the battery still has like 40% charge.Second and quite disappointing the installation mini disk as well as the software upgrades on the Nokia Website is not compatible with Windows 7.  After downloading all the suites OVI and ancillary software many of these do not work with Win-7. Then tried these with a NetBook running Win-XP and no problem with the updates.Having stated all this I consider that for the price paid ($219.00) the Nokia 5800 is a bargain when compared with their 51XX and 53XX series mostly because of its music playing capabilities awesome call features and quality.  But in my case the battery issue might make me consider other alternate phones.  Let's see what I decide and meanwhile I hope that this initial review helps you to decide if the Nokia 5800 is the phone for you.  In case that you are considering an I-Phone you should wait. The new smaller and slim I-Phone 4-G goes on sale in June 2010.
2	Phone features are very nice.  However after a few months it started to shutdown without warning (battery was charged) and sometimes when this happens it would erase the entire contents.  I've contacted amazon's customer service several days ago asking what I should do and did not receive any replies.  Despite the fact that this is a nice phone it's better to buy a more sturdy one.UPDATE: I've contacted Nokia USA which confirmed the phone is under warranty and asked to ship the phone to be serviced.  They returned the phone with the same problem.  I contacted their customer service and they asked to send the phone again.  Waiting for the outcome hopefully the phone will be really fixed this time.
2	I love this phone. The touch screen is just right too much but tolerable garbage programs on it by Nokia that you cannot remove. Decent but not great call quality. I thought I would not like stylus but really like its accuracy. Surfing the web (on ATT) is great with this phone. Its biggest problem is dropping calls shutting down acting like memory overflow when browsing the web and shutting down the browser. These problems cured temporarily by removing battery. The more you use it the more often you must pull battery to reboot. Mine is going back to Nokia for warranty repair tomorrow. Hope that helps. It came with V20  software upgraded to V21 but Nokia won't release the V30 software in US yet. Who knows that may cure problem but first they will have to spend their factory dollars to investigate since they won't give U.S. new software. Last Nokia I will ever buy. There must be a company that can make a phone with good hardware and/or software??? I wish it worked......  UPDATE 9-3-09: ZPhone was having so many problems sent it in to their REPAIR depot. It came back in ONLY 6 DAYS and has worked PERFECTLY since. They noted they replaced crystal filter. I really like this phone and feel it is perfect now. It does make me want a larger screen and the new 4 inch devices being released are very tempting (when we can buy them unlocked). I hope they are are good as this phone for usability. Will consider other Nokias based on their repair service.
2	IMPORTANT NOTE:  This phone is carrier-unlocked.  It means that the phone itself does not require you to go with any one specific carrier in order to use it:  you just buy it swap your SIM card (if compatible) and start using.  HOWEVER: if you are not currently on an unlimited data plan with your carrier you absolutely MUST call your wireless carrier and talk to them about the phone.  The Nokia XpressMusic 5800 has a lot of settings that default to using your wireless carrier to pull down data and using these features (or in some cases just having them turned on) when your carrier bills you for data by the kilobit WILL lead to astronomically high phone bills.  I had a long conversation with AT&T; Service prior to purchasing this phone and their representative indicated to me that many people don't realize the hidden cost of their phone's features when not signed up for an unlimited data plan.  Before you buy take 10 minutes to call your carrier.  It can save you a lot of headaches.The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is an excellent phone for people who love media: it's got a browser for streaming easy-to-use software for transfers of your own files and it even has a built-in FM radio for listening to local stations (with the added bonus of being able to tag and label them). The screen is approximately the size of the screen on a Nintendo DS or the older Sony PSP with the difference being that colors are brighter resolution is sharper and the backlight is superior. Power button standard headphone adapter charge plug and USB connector are all on the top making it easy to access but conveniently out of the way. The touch screen is unlocked via a rocker key on the side and volume can easily be adjusted up or down along the same edge.In addition to this you can expect all the same features you find in most smartphones today: GIS-driven mapping systems Internet connectivity via WiFi (if like me you're not on an unlimited data plan) a multitude of Bluetooth capabilities integration with a PC or Mac via the USB Cable and of course a digital camera that takes good (but not great) pictures and video. One nice extra here is that if you hold the phone like a camera a button on top will quickly switch the phone to camera mode and also double as your auto-focus and picture-taking button.I like the feel of this phone and I definitely like the clarity and strength of the calls. There are times when it appears that I have only one bar but still can place clear and noise-free calls that don't disconnect. The software is regularly kept up to date and once you get through the process of setting up an account at the Ovi Store it is remarkably easy to download and install applications many of which are free (but only some of which are useful).The one big drawback--and it is a serious one--is the interface. Features and Applications are in two separate sections and sometimes the dividing line between which is which is not exactly clear. The auto-rotate that switches from Portrait to Landscape can go off at the slightest of bumps and I have to shake the phone and wait for it to re-set. I bought the phone because I wanted a good solid handwriting device and this is where I have been most disappointed. Despite being a whiz at PDAs despite training (and re-training) the phone to my handwriting I get many botched translations. I have to force myself to scribe slowly because the delay time between reading my strokes and rendering a character is noticeably long. I have to patiently re-do most of my strokes over and over. To give credit where credit is due Nokia gives you a slim stylus cleverly hidden along the side of the phone and then they throw in a hip little gadget called a plectrum: it's a triangular guitar-pick that makes a handy substitute for a fingernail--consider this for pointing and clicking and the stylus for handwriting.There is however one sin that seems unforgivable and I'm surprised that a year and a half down the road the updates still haven't addressed it:The phone dialer has no letters on it.Let me rewind that: if you call up the dialer in other areas of the phone (such as via contacts) you will see the letters imprinted on the dial pad. However if you want to dial a number with letters in it (say 1-800-FLOWERS) you are out of luck: the dialer shown when dialing the phone does not display any letters. The fact that the letters are imprinted elsewhere in the system but not where they are most important is what makes the lack of this fix annoying.Also while the software is easy to use it is also incredibly slow and buggy in Windows Vista or Windows 7. The interface often turns black and I have to scrub my mouse over the window to re-draw my menus and panels.If you really like media and want a phone for music pictures and video the 5800 XpressMusic is not bad. However if you're looking for a pocket-sized computer that can do whiz-kid propeller-head tricks the 5800XpressMusic will most likely disappoint especially given its price. As much as I appreciate what Nokia was trying to do with this phone it really wasn't significantly different from my Motorola RAZR.NOTE: I cannot confirm that this is true of all Nokia 5800 XpressMusic phones but the USA Phone that was shipped to me contained a European power adapter. This huge chunk of plastic contains a converter to allow it to plug into US electrical outlets but it also means that your charger is anything but pocket-sized. I sent mine in for a replacement only to discover that the replacement also contained the same Euro-plus-converter-widget charger.
2	Oh Boy where do I start a review for this product.I saw this product on Sale at Dell website and overly impressed with the specs and the reviews on Amazon - almost immediately I ordered one for myself and just about to order another one for my wife.  I put it on hold till I try out one of them - glad that I did not order the 2nd one.Initially I did not like the idea of going for a $30 data plan with At&t; and being stuck to a service provider for 2 long years and badly wanted to buy something with no data plan.Let me break down each of the feature functionality of this product in detail - it is probably the most detailed review you will find on this product.  First the good part and then the bad stuffAs a phone - receive/make calls  :  10/10===============================Full marks to Nokia as a phone - the phone has excellent signal reception compared to any of the smart phones out there in the market.  I have used a blackberry/iphone/samsung and Nokia score above allCamera (stills) : 5/10===============Camera is good for outdoors but very poor for indoors - the photos look very grainy.  Front camera is decent and you can use it to make video calls with your friends running fring on their iPhone/Android and other nokiaCamera (video) : 7/10===============Video quality is excellent I have shot a few videos outdoors and almost compares to HD qualityCamera/Video/Front/Rear switch : 2/10==============================Since the phone feature video stills front & rear camera: Switching from a video to still and back to video.  Switching from front to rear camera and back is so difficult and non-intuitive.  I am a pretty good geek with stuff and I found it extremely difficult and confusing to switch between different modes.Calender Memo... : 5/10======================Can sync with Exchange on your computer but cannot sync directly with exchange servers unlike android/iphones which can directly connect to your company servers.  Which means everytime you need to connect the phone to the computer for syncMusic player/Video : 7/10==================Music player output is very good lacks a audio book player.  It does not playback divx movies (sorry torrent folks :)Youtube playback: 2/10================Ok I thought I will be able to use this to play youtube videos to entertain my daughter while driving we are driving.  I was not able to play even a single youtube video without pauses and jerks made several attempts and finally gave up.Read on the forums and some suggested me to use the desktop version & try it on wifi - But even on Wifi while it is better than 2g/3g - it is still disgusting playback speed.I was very disappointed with this whole youtube playback partYahoo/Gmail access : 3/10==================Imagine that you open a mail and it comes up as  new mail  &lt;href image= ....>This phone does not even support html emails no images either.  Other than that the good part is that it does a pretty good job of syncing with Gmail & Yahoo and downloads the emailsKeyboard  : 7/10=========The keyboard was a bit impressive - you have 3 options - mini keyboard full size keyboard or you can write in your handwriting.  I liked to input text with the full size keyboard as this one was the most convenient.Apps  : 2/10====Yes there is an app store but it the store is so poorly organized and very user unfriendly that you would end up spending hours to find the right app for you.Next the apps itself - there are some decent apps available for gaming and productivity but if you have used any android/iPhone app - you will realize that Nokia is waaaaay to behind in the game.Touch Screen: 3/10=====================First of all this is a resistive touch screen means you need to actually put pressure on the screen for it to work unlike the modern day capacitive touch screen which will only need you to just touch and the screen will pick up static charges from your fingers.So the Nokia's resistive touch screen works but it is very poor in response - you will almost always need the accompanying stylesRadio : 3/10======It does have a radio but it will not play unless you plug in the headset which acts as a antenna.  Even after plugging in the antenna it picks up a few strong signals but did not pick up some of the weaker signals neither indoors nor outdoors.GPS  ; 4/10====I have a 3 year old GPS from garmin and I thought I will throw it out after I get a Nokia.  Oh oh big mistake.  The Nokia phone comes with a assisted GPS (means it does triangulation with satellites as well as with cell phone towers.While the phone does a good job of finding your current location it is extremely poor in finding directions and reading out the street names and directions.  It works but it is no where near to a regular GPS or a built in GPS like the ones in iphone/android=========== summary =============Honestly I have never felt this frustrated with any phone in my life- when I really wanted to love this so much.Nokia - where art thou ? come down from your ivory tours and give us a good phone.  We do not want to be stuck up in the vicious circle of At&t; and apple - we want unlocked phones and we do not want to see crappy phones like this from you.  Pls wake up.
2	I PURCHASED SEVERAL THEY WORK GREAT FOR ME ONLY DOWN FALL IS THE FOAM BUDS AND RUBBER EAR INSERT COME OFF EASILY. THE SOUND IS GREAT BETTER THEN THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONES I HAVE PURCHASED IN THE PAST
2	I remember I LOVED my headset that came with my Blackberry 8330 but I soon grew tired of how limited the OS was so finally settled on a Droid. They lasted me a good two years but when I received these earlier today they just don't feel the same. Sound quality is great people can hear me just fine; though the wires connecting to the mic are loose & can easily be pushed in causing my music to turn itself off and my calls to end. Something my ORIGINAL headset didn't do. These are fake and generic. I'm content with my order but you're better off buying real ones off Crackberry.
2	these are good for the price. sound is clear and loud button works on my droid2 but the comfort is not for long term use (over an hour) at least not for my ears.
0	DID not fir my phone and I forgot to send it back.  On screen the battery resembles the one that is in my phone but I received a completely different battery.  I shoulda sent it back but I forgot
2	I purchased this item as a temporary replacement bc i lost mine. I didnt read the reviews correctly. So i was surprised when I found out there is no way to get on the internet at all with any data plan but i was only going to use this phone till I ordered my insurance replacement. It worked fine for three days and wouldn't turn back on. I returned it and I am getting my refund. So far they have been very helpful and quick. I mailed the phone back Monday and Thursday I got an email saying they have issued the refund to my bank and its being processed with the shipping amount I paid to have it returned!! for this alone Im giving it two stars. Fast and Easy refund!
0	I got this phone for my little sister.... she broke it the first week and overall it couldn't do a lot... so not my fav.
0	I have wanted a sidekick for a couple years and finally found this one for under $50 and I didn't have to extend my contract. I opened the box put the battery in my sim card and SD card and it worked.Over the past couple days I have made a list of the pros and cons.Pro:It has a real cool screen with awesome color that swivels open and made everyone at work say Ooooo!Cons:* I think there are more buttons than you need many are repetitious but they look impressive. Most of the functions take several steps. I work with computers and accessories all day I am not intimidated by something different. But this was not a well thought out design.* A tiny button on the top opens the camera. It's a very tiny black button flat to the surface and the same color as the phone so its hard to find and difficult to push I used my fingernail when I found it. You can take both photos and video. I somehow got the camera into video mode and it took a while to get it back to photo. The picture it took was good quality.* There are no one step calls as with other phones. There are several ways to make a call which I won't go through but it is neither easy nor convenient. The swivel screen is in the way when making a phone call. The basic function of a cell phone should be making calls quick and easy. The Sidekick gets an F for that. And the same grade for reception. My last phone a very basic and inexpensive phone gets reception in places this one can't receive or make a call like in my house.* I don't think this phone should be categorized under slider I have a slider and closing it is a simple one hand move. This doesn't slide it swivels.* With all the functions they have available there is only one alarm.* I had TMobile turn on data so I could download features I need like another alarm but The phone was never able to access the Internet so I cancelled that service.* It makes loud annoying sounds for whatever you do opening the screen keystrokes and just about everything. So I adjusted the settings to silent and turned the ring volume up a multi step process through the menu. When I am at work I turn the volume down then later when I turn the volume up it resets all the sounds back on.* Texting is not easy to access another multi step process. Getting texts is in a whole different location than writing a new text.* There are many buttons and some just duplicate what others do. It looks impressive but that's all.* The screen and buttons are not customizable so there is no way to set up one step shortcuts for features you use often.Everything that other phones do with a simple one or two steps this phone requires attention to what you are doing and has multiple steps many starting from the menu. Doing almost anything with this phone is like carrying your PC around and trying to get into programs without shortcuts on the desktop.This is not a phone you can hand to a friend and tell them here use my phone. You either have to dial for them or hand them the users manual. Which in this case is a DVD.
0	It did not work for me. It is not that adhesive and creates bubble easily.  I tried it till the last film (3 films) but still the same. Good thing it is cheap. Well? That's the price i had to pay & what you pay is what you get! My bad. Good thing seller gave me a refund thou. :)
2	When I had my 3gs I would always go through screen protectors. This pack of 3 really was a great buy for the price and served it purpose. They aren't the best out there but they did their job. I upgraded my phone to the iphone 5 and now I'm done with flimsy plastic screen protectors. I use the Spigen Glas.T screen shield. Wow!!! Its like not having anything on it at all and you get excellent protection. I will never go back to a thin plastic screen protector ever again.
0	Bubbled up by button and earpiece didn't like this product wouldn't buy it again and I don't recommend it.Hope this helps.
0	I MUST SAY THE PRICE WAS AWESOME.. BUT I MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN SOME BAD ONES.. BECAUSE THEY WOULDNT STAY ON.. :(
2	Can be used for lots of different places other than the vehicle...Very securely mounted...Can even talk on the telephone using it...:)
2	Not long after receiving this product the holder broke since its generic it was difficult to slip in my 3GS and eventually cause the clips to break
2	I was not happy because I have to take my phone out of the Otterbox Defender series (what a pain) to snap the phone into place in this holder. I don't love having to do that but if you dont use a case it does hold on to the windshield great. The suction on the windshield is great.
0	this broke in a few days of using it never going to buy this again waste of my money good luck to everyone else
0	What junk. I am terribly disappointed in the lack of quality these sweatshop made covers have. They feel like cardboard painted with clear polymer. It is a huge Rip Off.
2	Does not fit perfectly but this unit was a stop gap for me until I got the new Sector Elements case.  It did its job but not the best alternative out in the market.
2	The case is skinniest case that I found but still with some grippy sides to avoid having the whole thing slip out of the hand. It does not provide protection i the top edge or bottom edge of the iphone as well as over the volume & vibrate buttons. I would have liked to make this my only case but when the leather which seems to be glued on literally started peeling and ripped off of one entire edge (see picture) I had to demote it.
0	I bought this leather iPHone 5 case before I received the iPHone 5. The phone arrived before the case so it took a long time coming. I know better than to order anything other than Amazon Prime but this case LOOKED good from the description.  NOWHERE on the box does it say the case is leather.  When I took it out it was sticky and had the look and feel of plastic coated fabric.  It even has a fabric grain.  I also know better than to order from this seller as I have had dismal experiences with ordering cases for other devices.  They arrive and don't fit right but to return them you have to pay almost what they cost to purchase.  Not worth it all the way around.  This case WILL NOT protect my iPhone 5 from anything let alone a fall; and the feel is downright off-putting.  It seems like a hastily made case to try to cash in on the iPhone 5 rush--but they couldn't even get it here on time with plenty of pre-order time.  DO NOT order this case if you are expecting leather; and no where in this world would it sell for the supposed retail of $49.95 immediately reduced to $9.95 before it ever came out.  It is an opportunistic way to cash in on the 5 needs without providing a quality or usable product and severely misrepresenting this.  DO NOT BUY unless you are willing to write it off when you don't like it because return will cost--even on a defective and misrepresented product.
0	Very uncomfortable people could not hear me well at all; would not stay in the ears. I sent back.
2	I purchased this device and had it stolen on the first day of use.  I was so pleased with the Backbeat's comfort and sound quality that I decided to purchase another pair despite owning another set of Bluetooth headphones - the Jabra BT1101.  The 1101's Bluetooth connection was spotty at time for no reason and uncomfortable after 30 minutes of use.  The ear fit was loose so the sound wasn't as filling as in ear headphones.  The Backbeat 903/906 are a great step up from the adequate Jabra BT 1101 headphones.Edit:After owning if for several months I found the build quality low and customer service lacking. I still like the form factor but the headphones no longer charge and the stems leading to the earpieces are breaking apart.
0	I've had 2. I used one set that broke after about 4 days. I believe it was damage from sweat. The power button quit working. I sent the other one back just because I regretted not getting a refund in the first place. I have owned multiple bluetooth headphones and I know what the normal range is. These have very poor range. The will disconnect with out line of site. Especially when you are outside. Do not work out with these! Not only will the sweat break them but they do not have range to play music in your pocket if you are outside.
2	I was given this headset to use during my workouts. After less than a month it's started malfunctioning. It will randomly (and repeatedly) activate phone functions such as redial or voice control. When this happens it becomes impossible to turn the headset off. Eventually it goes back to normal but then it just starts malfunctioning again. Seems it can't handle a little sweat which seems odd for a device that is made for sporty use.
0	I bought the 906 version which is identical to the 903 but adds a bluetooth transmitter dongle for non-bluetooth devices.This is my 4th Plantronics bluetooth device and the 2nd that has been stereo BT. I will be taking this back after a day of use for these reasons:1) These are uncomfortable. I hate ear phones and love earbuds(or canal phones or In-Ear-Monitors). These seem to be somewhere in-between. After about 30 minutes my ears hurt. Granted I've been using Sony earbuds for the last 8 years so that's what I am comparing them to. I can wear my buds for 8+ hours with no discomfort I've been wearing the Backbeats for 3.5 hours today and they've been uncomfortable throughout. You only get one size and I'd say I have average to small ear canals.2) These only sound alright. Again I'm coming from 8 years of the same $60 earbuds from Sony. These have a lot more treble and sound tinny to me. I had a much better experience with the older Plantronics 855 stereo bluetooth which used earbuds similar to the Sonys. I like more defined bass that gives rock and alternative music a punch. The Backbeats make music I am familiar with sound much less dynamic. I had to use the bass boost option on all music. I think most people will be fine with the sound but more discerning listeners should look elsewhere. There is a feature called OpenMic which is supposed to allow you to hear the outside world better when you press a button. I had no problems hearing around me with this option turned on or off one of the 2 settings just adds a low static hum.3) I made one phone call for 30 minutes while driving in my car with the windows up and after 5 minutes my friend told me to take them back because I was difficult to understand and my voice sounded hollow. They were functional but not transparent. On my end I had no problems understanding my friend so no complaints receiving.On a positive note all of the buttons on the Backbeat worked as expected with my HTC Incredible. I was able to pause back track and forward track songs adjust volume. Pairing was easy. I use Meridian music player on my Incredible and the Backbeat controls it well. If you go into the Meridian player's preferences you can turn off the headset controls and that will allow you to control Pandora Last FM and Slacker. Slacker sounded terrible - it seemed to have a dramatic lack of bass which I've read is a known problem with Slacker when not using Wi-Fi.Battery life seems great. I've been listening to music and made 40 minutes of phone calls for the last 4 hours and the Backbeat battery indicator shows that it is still 1/3 to 2/3's full. I'm not willing to use these any longer due to ear discomfort.The over the ear design wasn't too bad when I had my thick Arnette sunglasses on. But add a baseball cap on top and you've got a problem. The cord behind the neck is solid but as others have noted if you want to lay with the back of your head against a pillow or headrest it will significantly apply pressure to your ears and this really highlights how uncomfortable the Backbeat is to wear.The separate dongle that you get with the 906 model worked as expected. I had to go through the pairing process each time I switched between my Incredible and the dongle. I'm not sure if there is a better way but it didn't seem automatic after the initial pairings.Bottom line don't bother trying these out unless you can take them back for a full refund. They look good on but if they don't fit you just right I think you are going to be disappointed. I've also read that there may be some huge reliability issues with the Backbeat and they do not seem to hold up to sweat so you should probably avoid these at all costs.
0	I've a had my now for a little less than a year. I bought them last May and they have stopped working! I will still probably buy another set because over all the $40 is cheaper than buy the $15 wired earbuds that last about a month.  I just want the manufacturer to admit these are not sweat proof and make a pair that really are water proof  it can be done!
2	I've owned the product for 3 years.  I bought it and a Plantronics Voyager Pro at the same time.  The Plantronics Voyager Pro failed 1 year and 1 month later.  The folks at Plantronics basically said tough would you like to buy our latest model?  They had no interest in the fact that I was dissatisfied and had contacted them several times about the call clarity of the unit.  (They blamed it on my iPhone even after I exchanged the phone for another one to resolve the issue.  Then they said it was an iOS issue that would be taken care of in an upgrade.  Then later said too bad your exchange time is up live with it and hope Apple fixes the issue.  Turned out it wasn't an Apple issue.)  Since everyone I talked to regularly was complaining about the call clarity on their end of the call when I used the Voyager Pro I decided to look on it as a chance to replace it with something from a different company.  (They also complained when I called from the airport on the Plantronics BackBeat 903 but I used it so seldom for a call it wasn't important the stereo sound without tangling wires was nice on the plane and in the airport.)The Plantronics 903 BackBeat purchased at the same time as the Voyager Pro was purchased solely to use on airplane trips.  It has only about 80 hours of total use and looks brand new...including standby time it has only been turned on about 81-82 total hours in the last 3 years.  It has been stored in a special travel case...which I purchased for it in my dresser drawer with some clothing.  I got it out yesterday to check it for pairing with my phone for a trip I intend to take next month.  It did exactly the same as the Voyager Pro when it died; worked for a few minutes fluttered quit and refused to re-charge or turn back on.  I had bought Plantronics products because I have an 8 year old Plantronics bluetooth headset (that I still use as a backup)....it still works fine and nobody complains about the call clarity when I need to use it.  The quality of their older models was excellent both in use and longevity...you really got your money's worth from their earlier products.  (I bought a Jawbone Era to replace the Voyager Pro and everyone has always been very happy with the call clarity...it is two years old now so I recently bought a Bose bluetooth headset and again...everyone is happy with the call clarity.)My point being that something seems to have happened with Plantroics manufacturing quality a few years ago.  Their older bluetooth headsets were well made reliable had good range good battery time and the call clarity was wonderful.  The products I bought 3 years ago including the Plantronics 903 BackBeat just turned out to be a big waste of money.  Unless Plantronics has revisited their roots and begun making quality products again knowing what I do now I certainly wouldn't consider this headset.  The 903 BackBeat would not have held up to someone using it for jogging or exercise...it didn't hold up even for occasional use while traveling on an airplane.  Anyone considering this headset should take a look at other products.  I'm not sure Plantronic's newer stereo headset model is better but I don't think I will risk it.I'll either used a wired headset when listening to stereo music or enjoy the sound in only one ear from the new Bose headset I bought....it really is fantastic how rich the Bose sound is when playing music...even though it is only in one ear.  I really hope they come out with a stereo bluetooth dual ear model.  After my past experience with Plantronics poor customer service I'm sure a call to them about a hardly used 3 year old 903 BackBeat would be another futile waste of time.  I really don't expect my electronics to last more than a couple of years with constant use.  But anyone should expect more than around 80 hours of use time from a product they spend $99.99 for....the price was still on the box from the Apple Store.)  If I decide to buy another bluetooth stereo headset it will be some brand other than Plantronics.  I'm glad I read the reviews and didn't buy their latest single ear headset when I bought the Bose instead last month.  Stick with Jawbone and Bose you will be happy.
2	I bought this headset to replace my beloved BlueFox 401s.  I like to listen to audiobooks during my long commute.  If I have a lot of telephone calls a full charge is not enough to last all the way home in the evening.  The issue with the BlueFox is that there is no iGO tip available so I can't charge them at work unless I carry around the wall charger.  The BackBeats charge with a standard micro USB tip (A97).  They fit on my head much the same as the 401s except that the flexible ear pieces fit a little more comfortably. The controls work very well with my Droid Eris while only some of the 401 controls worked properly.  I love the behind-the-head style headset because my hair hides the headset so nobody can see it.  The behind-the-head part on the BackBeat is flexible.This headset is multi-point you can pair to more than one device at a time.If you are trying to decide between the BackBeat 903 and the 906 the only difference is that the 906 comes with a bluetooth adapter for devices that don't support bluetooth.  If you are using a mobile phone the 903 will work.UPDATE August 18 2011:  Although I really liked this headset after less than a year of use it stopped working.  The volume suddenly dropped so low that I couldn't hear.  It happened while I was listening to a recorded book from my iPad.  No amount of messing around with the controls or resetting helped.  I ordered the Motorola S10 as a replacement.  I dropped my review to 2 stars because I think a headset should last longer especially since I was not a heavy user - only one or two days a week.
2	The wire in back will chafe your neck and grip your shirt collars the buttons are not ideally placed the FF/REW/VOL switch is cool but slow to operate and they're inconvenient to charge. They aren't complete junk but I do regret having kept them. :(Update: the left earpiece doesn't sit in my ear no matter how I orient the multiple adjustments.
0	THIS DEVICE SHOULD BE PULL OFF THE SHELF AND TOSS THEM IN THE TRASH.THEY NEED TO REFUND CUSTOMERS. IT DOES NOT TUCK INTO THE EARS. YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT WITH BOTH OF YOUR HANDS TO LISTEN TO IT WHICH NOBODY WANT TO DO IT. THE IDIOT WHO APPROVED THIS PROJECT SHOULD STEP DOWN AND FIND ANOTHER BRIGHT PERSON
2	I had it for about 2 weeks.  The Altec Lansing Backbeat sound quality was good when it came to music. However sometimes when I was receiving calls the caller couldn't hear me & vice versa.  When the call did work and came through the caller complained of excessive background noise.  But the main problem I had was the fact it didn't want to stay snugly on my head...in my ears. I am a female with what I'd like to believe an average size head but at times one side would come out of 1 ear and I'd have the worse time trying to get it coiled back around my ear to stay.  While finally getting the one side fixed the other would come off.  Very annoying. It could have just been me but it shouldn't be that difficult.Over all it connected to my phone (EnV Touch) very easily & kept the connection in spite of where I was at or what I was doing.  I returned it and will be trying the Motorola MotoROKR S9-HD Bluetooth Stereo Headset.
2	I got it even for less than the price above (fourty)and i wouldn't give it more than 3 stars. Yet it was still really good that i got a second one later on! The sound is really great the fit is good and i have average ears stays still while walking or running. The wireless experience with really good sound was and still is amazing for me i even bought a bluetooth adapter for my ipod so i wont use all my phone's battery. BUTthis headphone has other bad sides that u need to consider if u can live with them..like i did..u got urself a gr8 deal!First that wire at the back of ur head won't allow u to wear this with high collar clothes!it is flexible yet still longer than it should be my neck is smaller than average so this may be the reason in all cases they should have made it adjustable coz it will annoy you while sitting or laying on ur back.. I have two of these one refurbished & one new.. Like many reviewers here the refurb. had many connection problems..some may think the headphone broke but it didn't! I was about to return it but decided to call Plantronics first to ask about it..it turned out to be just that it needed a reset ( never happened to the new one yet though its connection is smooth & easy!) To reset it u have to hold the power key while plugging the charger in the light will turn on and u can connect it normally to ur phone afterward! just make sure u turn off the headphone first before unpairing...for all this hassle it takes 3 stars(yeah not 2 nor 1) if the connection issue is solved and the back wire became adjustable this babe could easily get a 5 out of 5.*edit* The refurb one probably didn't have a very powerful connection but this helped when there was many bluetooth devices in the area..! I found that the new one tends to be a little bit more intermittent & the music breaks more often due to the very strong connection that keep looking for bluetooth devices even when paired and the music is on! However if u are in a big gym where people aren't working out all the time around u it won't be a very big deal..
2	I'm so mad I can't see straight!!  So keep that in mind as you read this review.  Because I won't bother repeating all the praises the 1 star reviewers have given it.  It's all true.  They're usually awesome.  Sound quality is great battery life is long - and it doesn't take long to charge them up.But with that said - there is one thing that is so HUGELY ANNOYING it prompted me to write this review - so I could vent.  When the battery gets low - this ANNOYINGLY LOUD VOICE comes on saying BATTERY IS LOW!  And they've designed is to the volume of whatever you're listening to is cut to about 20% and the volume of this announcement is 80%.  SO ANNOYING I can't even tell you!You're on the phone you have 2 hours of charge left - and this stupid announcement starts going off every couple of minutes.  Every time it goes off - you can't hear a word the person you're talking to is saying.So let's say you're doing a job interview or talking to a prospective client over the phone.  This person starts telling you what they're looking for and you really want to hear this because it has everything to do with whether or not you'll get the job.  And right when they get to the most critical thing - suddenly their voice volume is cut to 20% and all you hear blaring over their voice is - BATTERY CHARGE IS LOW!!!It'll drive you nuts!The sad thing is - this is a huge flaw on an otherwise perfect pair of headphones.  And the sadder thing is - it's completely unnecessary.  There are so many other ways for them to indicate to you that the battery is low - non-intrusive ways.  Like they could have a low-volume beep.  Or they could have the voice say LOW BATTERY instead of BATTERY IS LOW.  It saves one word and can be said quicker.  And they could have it so this announcement uses 20% of the volume while allow whatever you're listening to take up 80%.Anyway I just had to post something about this because I was SCREAMING at my headphones a few minutes ago!  It just amazes me how giant companies that only hire the smartest people in the world can do such dumb idiotic things.UPDATE 1/21/2014:  I just got a new pair of these because the battery on the old pair pretty much died.  (It lasted about 7 months).  This new pair is much better on the low battery announcements.  Much less intrusive.
0	I bought them to use with my iPhone 4. It worked great for 24hrs. All the controls worked and life was great. Call quality and sound were both very good. On the second day the pause button stopped working and I couldn't change tracks anymore. Resetting and reconnecting didn't do any good. I sent them back and am now looking for other options.Believe me I wanted to like this product...and I did when it worked. Maybe you'll have better luck but for the price luck shouldn't have anything to do with it. Sorry Plantronics.
2	Unfortunately I had to return this headset as many others complain of the same problem. The audio is lost when your in movement. I tried keeping my cellphone very close to the headset to no avail. Needless to say they're of no use if you have to keep entirely motionless.
2	Bluetooth headphones are one of those things that once you get used to you can't live without. In car they are especially useful and then while exercising or going about the house and being able to use phone or MP3 player. The advantage of stereo Bluetooth headphones is that you can use them for music and phone both not to say the good sound quality. After usingPlantronics Pulsar 590 590A Ultimate Stereo Sound Innovation Bluetooth Headsetfor almost 4 years I wanted something low profile that is easy to use while exercising. Here is what I found about these BackBeat headphones.PROS1. Low profile and and nice design.2. The accompanying users guide does not really explain how to place these headsets. But they just sit over the ears outside the canal and you do not insert the silicone ear buds inside the ear. Once you place them these are very comfortable in upright position. But finding the right location for ear buds takes some time and fiddling around in both axes verical as well as rotation. It took me a while to find that and I wish company had explained in literature or had a video demo on their web site.3. Easy to pair.4. Good clear voice quality and noise suppression.5. Good quality music sound in entire frequency range.6. Ubiquitous Micro-usb charger.7.. Pleasant audible tones let you know when there is a new call or when the unit is turned on and off.CONS1. Bluetooth connection keeps disconnecting. For example you use in one phone call and and for the next call the headphones are not working.  For me this was the biggest drawback which made me return these headphones.2. Although they say you can connect two devices simultaneously in practice it does not work well. To give you the example say you are listening music on iPod Touch you get a phone call and when you hang up the iPod Touch is disconnected.3. Short range the sound quality drops after about 9-10 feet and Bluetooth disconnects after about 20 feet.4. Accidentally pressing the Call and Play/pause buttons while adjusting the headphones in ear is very easy and happens all the time. But volume button nicely placed and works well.5. Track forward and back does not work with iPod Touch.6. Microphone does not work on iPod Touch.7. Does not work for music on Palm Centro only the phone part.8. On Macs you pair it as headsets and it will work well for a while. Then mysteriously the Bluetooth audio profile changes to Headphones and Headsets and it will stop working in either profile. If you pair as Headphones the microphone does not work.9. While it is comfortable in upright position you cannot use in lying down position because the back cord is thick moves and the headphones come out off the ears. Same while exercising on treadmill keeps coming off the ear.10. Poor battery life about 4-5 hours use. You have to charge them for 3 hours to be able to use them for 4 hours!11. No indicator light to let you know when it is on. Blue lights comes on for a second when you first turn it on and then goes off.There are a lot of nice things about these headphones but they need to improve the software so it does not disconnect thin the back connecting cord explain how to place the headphones in or over the ear and make that telescoping and rotating mechanism a little sturdy so it holds in the same position. Since thePlantronics Pulsar 590 590A Ultimate Stereo Sound Innovation Bluetooth Headsetrarely disconnected the repeated disconnection was really the clincher for me which made me return these headphones and replace them with New Samsung WEP870 Mono + Stereo BT Headset which I found on sale at Verizon Wireless web site lot cheaper than here.
2	Seems well constructed fits a naked iPhone 4 perfectly but look for a different solution if you want to use this while keeping your iphone in a bumper or shell type case.
0	The product itself seems decent. Quality is good etc. however it was advertised as fitting a Galaxy Nexus it does not. If you have a Galaxy Nexus and want your phone to fit completely in the case don't buy this. Because it won't. It sticks out top the screen part that sticks out is not used for the disply but is doens't look good. Very dissapointed for the price I paid for this. Do not recommned it for larger phones at all.
2	I tried twice and didn't get a great seal on the screen. I'm sure it can be done and I was only having trouble because I'm a clutz. But if you're thinking about buying 1 just go for the three. I'm sure they don't last forever.
0	I received it broken and they didn't offer to replace it. You get what you pay for. Do not buy!!!!
2	I loved it ....it cam in handy when i needed to charge my phone while on the road.But after 4 months it fell apart.
0	I purchased this charger for my Samsung Google Nexus phone and was quite disappointed.  While I believe that it might have technically been able to charge my phone if it was off or not in use it did not meet my needs.  It was unable to charge the phone while I had it on and in use for navigation.  At best it was keeping the phone at the same charge.  I believe this was a 700mah charger and my 2000mah charger is doing a much better job.  YMMV but I'd suggest looking elsewhere.
0	Made in China.The quality of this Samsung unit is questionable.The two halves of the case do not line up correctly there is excess molding around the front where you insert it into the 12v cig lighter. The sticker was on crooked.I think this thing is a fake. Works fine on my Girlfriends Samsung galaxy but doesnt work on my LG. Came in a small zip-loc style bag with no other information.I'd avoid it and get a different unit. I have owned samsung products in the past and they never have released anything as poorly built as this.
0	Don't work as simple as that.  Tried in the 3 cars of my house just in case. I'll have to buy another from another source. Shipped in time and in a normal-good package.
0	Should have read reviews before I ordered this item. Don't both buying for the Samsung S3. Snail pace charging. I wasted my money.
0	I receive this charger after 10 day and it stop to work after hourpiece of junk pleas to not buy don't spent your money on this charger
2	The product claims to have a Dynamic IC Chip (a built-in smart chip that recognizes a full charge and automatically switches to a save-mode that protects your battery from over charging and preserves your battery's life span) and I cannot verify that the feature is working.  How do you tell that it's stopped charging?  Because the green light on the charger stays lit all the time even after the phone says it's fully charged.The green light could not be brighter.  It's distracting in its brightness.  It is SO bright I've put a piece of masking tape over it.  Sounds pretty attractive right?!?It is very hard to plug it into my vehicle's outlet--I have to really shove it and both the charger and the outlet bend in the struggle.  My last charger inserted much smoother.  My last charger had a longer cord too.Good thing I didn't need it desperately because it only ships one way:  By mail from China.
0	Have had a few samsung chargers like this one before and they honestly don't last very long at all. Don't understand why the crap out so easily but be advised that you are taking a chance.
0	Worked fine for about 3 months and then it just stopped charging swapped it between a couple of cars and all had the same effect. Checked the fuse and it wasn't blown; it just stopped working.
0	This looks like it's built well and has engraved &#34;Samsung&#34; but I have had nothing but trouble with this charger.  It fits too loose in the socket and the wire has to be wiggled and held in position for a constant charge.  There are def some loose connections.  Vendor sent me a replacement that wound up doing the same thing.  I do not recommend this product.
0	I am highly disappointed with this product. Not to mention I received this product that fits a little loose into my actual car charger. It charges my phone on and off now. I really thought I wouldn't have to buy another charger for a while but it looks like I was wrong! I bought a usb car charger (I just hook up my usb cord to my phone charger) for about 3$ from walmart and this product lasts longer and is more durable. I find it quite sad and I would never buy this product this again. It's like I threw money out the window go find another product.
0	I bought this charger and it didn't work.  I obviously wouldn't buy it again it was frustrating to plug my phone in and never have it charge.
0	When I originally wrote the review I stated that this charger actually worked. And it did. Unfortunately only for a couple months then it just died. I don't know what happened but I had to throw it out. Don't waste your month on this. It'll end up in the same place mine did... the trash.
0	This item is very cheaply made and fell apart in multiple places within a few months. The microUSB port got twisted and bent so that it would not connect. The DC plug in section came unglued/attached and the wire got loose. The whole unit basically just opened up on its own and could not be closed again in a way that it would stay closed. Had to just throw the whole piece of junk in the trash. I do not recommend this product for any price.
2	this lasted me for quite some time. I would say its cheap quality but it will get the job done.
2	I plug this into my car 12volt socket and the light does not come on until I plug in my phone ???? That's weird normally you see the little green or red light on when it's plugged into the socket. Never had a car charger that lights up  AFTER  you plug in the phone.
2	This USB car charger / power source works better then others as the connector is strong and the coiled cord makes it easy to use and travel with - I RECOMMEND IT.
2	It was working fine for a while.  Then it began to take longer to charge until it eventually conked out which is why i normally like to wait before submitting a review.
2	Pros:Real Samsung charger.Nice Build qualitySleek lookingCons:Slower rate of charge 700mah (Not the 1A or 2A)Green LED is annoying and very brightAfter 6 months of heavy use it stops charging if the phone wiggles in my hand.  I don't know this will happen to most people as my daily usage is heavy.Slightly long could be more flush mount style.I am only reviewing this item that I purchased 6 months ago because I came to buy another charger  I will not buy this one again though I will now go with a more flush mount and a higher rate of charge. Probably the newer style USB chargers with the pins soldered together so that it will charge like a wall charger not slow speed trickle usb charger.
0	Within a few weeks of having this I had to have the phone at a certain angle for it to charge.  Then the wires on the inside wore out.  Don't buy it.
0	I confirmed my suspicion after purchasing a real OEM Samsung charger and comparing it with this product side by side. These are cheaply made Chinese knock-offs. Stay away from these. They don't work!!!!

0	Upon receiving item I immediately activated it but to find out it can only be used on speaker phone. The internal handset audio would not work. Had to return it to the seller
2	The phone was slow and didn't even upgrade it but the advantage was I could just put the international sim card into the device and it began to work
0	iphone 3g is stale  out of date and boring......i would rather go with the samsung galaxy android phone rather than iphone and their ios that never changes in 5 years.
0	COULDN'T DOWNLOAD ANYTHING
2	This phone worked for a few weeks and that's about it. It only worked until the time I could return it had expired.  I was not happy and would think twice about another purchase.
0	bought this phone from west net online and wouldnt charge got a relacement and the same issue. these are old phones with dead batteries or nearly dead batteries. dont waste your time or money. if you want an iphone i suggest you go with a newer model unless your able to change the battery yourself. just not worth the time or money. two iphones and none of them worked so a word to the wise buy something newer.
2	The iPhone 3G is the second generation of iPhone and was introduced on June 9 2008. So as of May 2013 it is a 5 year old device! It was stte of the art in 2008 not anymore. It is amazing it is still in top 10. Granted this is unlocked but it will perform really slow with modern apps. And the battery! Beware of that also.If you are going to browse/email and yes phone using this device it is a good buy after all. Don't expect to play the high adrenaline car racing games with this phone.* Weight  133 g (4.7 oz)* Operating system iOS 4.2.1 (build 8C148) Released November 22 2010; 2 years ago No longer supported;* CPU Samsung 32-bit RISC ARM 620 MHz* Memory 128 MB eDRAM* Battery 1150 mAh 3.7 V* Display 3.5-inch screen 320-by-480-pixel resolution at 163 ppi* Rear camera 2.0 MP
2	I am disappointed that Apple no longer makes apps for this phone and so the most recent features are unavailable
0	Do NOT buy this phone. Just don't. The phone is slow and there are not many apps that can be used on this outdated phone. Also my phone got stuck on the apple logo start-up screen after a few months of use because of the jailbreak. This phone was horrible. Do not waste your money!
0	This item is neither a Blackberry cable or a Data Sync cable. It will only supply a charge and no data synce ability. Item was inexpensive and very cheaply made. Spend another dollar and get a better cable.BlackBerry USB DataSync and Charging Cable with Micro USB for BlackBerry 8900 9500 and 8220
2	This cord is pretty much as advertised. I use it to connect my Droid Incredible 2 to my computer. The connection to the phone isn't tight and wiggles a lot but it doesn't seem to affect anything. It charges SUPER slow  but I'm not sure if that's the cord or just my computer.
2	Before anyone gets bent out of shape I just want to say that I knew full well what I was getting myself into.  Namely that some have used it for Blackberries.  That being said I decided that a couple of bucks was nothing much to lose with my experiment.  On a Samsung Intercept you'll notice that the micro usb area on the phone is covered by what seems like a flimsy tied on piece of rubber that folds down flat when not using the plug.  When you try to push the micro usb charger or sync plug into the phone it is a very tight fit and really can't be done (by me) in full dark.  I always have to use a separate light source to accomplish my goal but I risk waking up my hubby when I do that.  Also it has a short cord which is great if you don't need a long one.  I've also gotta say that the cable is really thick so it isn't forgiving and doesn't want to lay flat.Despite all that I do recommend it to anyone that doesn't want to pay an arm and a leg for these. They do the job.
2	I am not sure if this is an issue with my Blackberry or the cable but it does not work with my computers.
2	This cable does not charge using the stock wall adaptor for the Galaxy Nexus. It charges using weaker wall adaptors but only as USB which charges substantially slower.
2	Not the fault of the cable but it is the reason I purchased it. I'm sure it's a great cable otherwise.
2	I don't know the technical specifications but this USB to micro USB allows me to charge my kindle by plugging it into my computer or using an adapter to plug it into an outlet but not my blackberry curve.  When plugged into my computer I can drag and drop files to my kindle. I havent tried it with my blackberry.Also in case not all suppliers using this xescription are in fact supplying the same product (i dont know the rules for that) i got mine from Media Mart
2	I bought 2 of these for me and my wife the price was just that good!Granted the price is just too tempting I don't like the sound quality; it's just too distorted/muted. When talking to someone they need to concentrate when talking to me; things I say are not very crisp. It became apparent to me when talking to my wife she has to clearly say everything so I can hear her.Today I got frustrated and asked her to switch to her phone the sound clarity amazing. This is the main reason why I'm returning the headsets.If you're looking for a cheap hands-free headset this is for you. I'm looking for better sound quality though so I'll be exchanging these two for something else (probably PlanTronics Voyager 510/520).
2	giving as a gift for christmas.  once they tell me if it works well or not and being samsung it should i'll re-review
0	it was very cheap. it didnt really work and was very uncomfortable. BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT. although its inexpensive it is not worth your money. TRUST ME.
2	This headset is alright for what you pay. It picks up a lot of background noise. If you are trying to save some money then go with thisN95 Bluetooth Wireless HeadsetIt costs less than $5 and works fine.
0	Everyone couldn't understand me on this headset with my iPhone 4s...they said my voice was garbled and would cut in and out.  :(I ended up buying the Plantronics one instead (see link below) and it works SO much better!  No complaints on that one whatsoever.  I initially went with the Samsung because I trusted the name brand.  Don't make the same mistake I did!Plantronics M50 - Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black
0	Our Motorola Bluetooth died after many years of use. Coincidentially this SAMSUNG WEP 460 was on sale and seemed a bargain but buyer beware you get what you pay for.With the Motorola Bluetooth when you open the thing to attach it to your ear the unit turns on. When you remove it and close the ear thing it shuts off. This Samsung WEP460 has to be pushed to turn it on and off which is a pain in the neck to get used to and is an extra step. If you forget to shut it off after taking it off the power stays on and the battery will get drained.Worse is the fact that the charger it comes with is a standard AC adaptor for recharging inside your home. The way the packaging is the charger is hidden inside a plastic bubble container and hidden behind black paper. You have to look very closely at the back of the packaging where an image that is 1 millimeter is shown -- look closely at that fine line drawing and that is how you will know the charger inside is AC for indoor use.We had been in the routine of using the Bluetooth when driving the car and charging it in the car and just leaving both the Bluetooth and its charger in the car all the time. We don't presently own a cigarette lighter car recharger that fits the SAMSUNG WEP460 so that would be another purchase for us (therefore raising the price of the cost of owning this unit vs the Motorola Bluetooth). Today I see the compatible cigarette lighter car charger sells for MSRP $45 which is more expensive than this SAMSUNG WEP460 Bluetooth unit itself which seems crazy!The sound quality is just fine.We regret this purchase. Next time we'll buy the Motorola Bluetooth.We also learned a lesson that the cost of these accessories is not just the accessory but the charger units. When replacing existing accessories you can save money by purchasing accessories compatible with the charging units you already own.
2	I bought this headset simply because it was the cheapest option I could find. I was pleasantly surprised. It pairs with my iPhone 5 and functions perfectly. The speaker quality is quite good and it fits comfortably in my ear. Only problem is the microphone sound quality. I am frequently told that I sound like I'm talking from &#34;under the water&#34; or &#34;in a bubble.&#34; You also definitely have to speak up quite a bit. Still a good headset for me to use in my car.
0	Very uncomfortable. None of the different ear buds fit my ear and you could barely hear any sound on the highest volume.
0	I can't believe Samsung puts their name on this piece of junk. I mean who would sell a product  designed to fit on the ear and be held in place with a flimsy piece of plastic? The warning of things to come was the fact that 2 ear clips came with the unit. And once the 2 clips break the piece is unusable.So you get what you pay for!Junk.
2	THE JABRA EARPIECE HAS BETTER DEEP RICH SOUND. ITS A MORE REALISTIC SOUND AND THIS HAS AN ANNOYING BEEP EVERY NOW AND THEN
2	I've had a number of bluetooths before. A couple of Motorolas (which I love) an Emerson etc. This one has great sound quality. The volume is pretty low when you first put it on but after turning up the volume it works great. The buttons are easy to press and it answers without any issues and seems fairly reliable. It comes with two ear hooks but not two different sizes. It's strictly a replacement if one gets broken or lost. It also comes with several speaker covers so that it will fit inside your ear better. It's too bad then that the ear hooks don't come in sizes. Also there are no instructions at all on replacing the hooks nor the covers.My problem is that it refuses to stay on my ear and rubbed a sore right onto my ear. I tried switching all the speaker covers but that doesn't have anything to do with the ear hook. Also because there is no wire in the hook you cannot bend it to fit your ear properly. That is a definite design flaw. I have tiny ears compared to the average person. This bluetooth assumes that there is a lot of space between the side of my head and the edge of my ear. That is not the case at all with my ears. This is why a curve is important for me but there is none and no way to make one.In fact if you look carefully for a side view of this bluetooth you'll see that there is no curve whatsoever for the ear hook. It is commonly known that all should have a slant. I guess you get what you pay for. I never had this issue with my higher grade models. The ear hooks were both comfortable and reliable. This one makes my ear bleed and will not stay on. It's not how I put it on my daughter (who works at Radio Shack) even tried to help me but without success.If I could replace the ear hook then it would be a top-notch bluetooth but that is impossible so it gets a lower rating. Sorry Samsung!
2	It happened so many times that accidental pressing of multifunction button redials last number. So much trouble. Otherwise I found this great for the price.Pros:It paired so easilyGood sound qualityNeutral:Not very comfortable but OKConsMultifuction button redails the number frequently
2	I bought this to replace my 5 year old Plantronics. Which still worked great but the flexible earpiece was finally beyond my tweakability.With pretty decent reviews - and a sale price trying to be frugal - I got what I paid for.Binding issues. This puppy doesn't stay connected well to my HTC Incredible. Anytime It gets somewhat separated I have to push the connect/device button on the android to get it to reconnect. It's very frustrating and my Plantroncs was awesome about staying connected / re-connecting.Volume doesn't go up quite enough. I drive a Toyota Tundra and a Honda Odyssey which are both pretty quiet (both loaded vehicles) with a little truck road noise (tires) or kids. And it's barely loud enough if there's no other traffic and/or kids are quiet.Noisy to callees . People I call always complain about having difficulty understanding me so it doesn't do a good job of cancelling ambient noise.For both Noise and Volume reasons I end up driving with my left hand cupped over my ear and towards my mouth. Hands free? Not longer!Battery charge life is also poor. So unless I keep it plugged in (problematic with the AC only adapter and a pita) I never know if it's just failed to re-connect -- or is dead again.No more inexpensive / mid / low end headsets. You get what you pay for. Be sure to look for good reviews on noise cancelling power binding. And compare against more expensive models - as that's where you usually get references to this replaced my crappy xyz which you may otherwise find got good reviews from people that got lucky or didn't know better etc.
0	I got this and found it to fit me like a brick in the ear then changed phones and it would not sync with new phone. still have it using it for target practice.
2	tHIS WAS GOOD FOR A STARTER.  i HAVE PURCHASED A BETTER ONE SINCE BUT FOR THE MONEY SPENT IT WAS WORTH IT!
2	the ear bud thingy irritates your ear after a while and the battery dies kind of fast works good though.
0	I like to keep my reviews short and simple.  Don't buy this item for your BBry 8900. Look elsewhere for a quality product.
0	It looked very cheap and did not work for my ipod touch.  It broke trying to unplug it.  I got no response from supplier.
0	Fell apart after two weeks not a good quality item at all I would not recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a cord.
2	Attempts to SYNC with this cable failed - would only charge.Put a regular ol' IPOD cable - sync succeeded easily.
2	looks good. if they dont come damaged. They dont stay on the phone very well especially around the edges. If they stuck to the phone better i would give 5 stars. They look really good and easy to see through they just dont stay on well
0	I bought this as a replacement for my husband's iphone.  Previously he had the noel collection case which came with mirror screen protector.  This product compared to the old screen protected is extremely poor quality.  The mirror is very faded and when in active mode it makes your screen a green/blue color.I know these are cheap but I recommend going for the better quality ones.  I went for these and now have to buy a better one and pay shipping all over again don't make the same mistake.
2	Had no complains but this is not something I would buy again for a long term use is just to used it for some time then you get tired.
2	The screen protector works great on protecting the screen of the phone. And works great as a mirror if needed. The big draw back is if there is allot of light you can't see the face of your phone...:(
0	This screen protector is very thick and therefore very easy to apply.  However the mirrored surface makes the display on your phone dark at best and invisible in bright light.  I t makes a glare that you cannot see through.  I plan to return these even though it's not much money.
2	Don't like it  when I in the sun outside cant see the screen and it wasn't reusable at all .
2	When I purchased this product I thought I was ordering for an Iphone 4. So now I have all these screen protectors I can't use. I am to blame for not paying close attention to what I was buying. Otherwise its a nice product!!!!!!!!!
0	This screen protector performs as shown. What it does not tell you is you can barely see the screen after applied.  I increased the brightness to 100% and still had a hard time seeing the screen.
0	Do not buy this product not worth your money! The mirror effect is blurry and can't see anything. Service was great but product not worth it!
2	i bought these as a replacement for the screen protector i purchased when i got the phone.  my old one had been beaten up and had a few nicks in it (after a year and a half).  i put one of these on a few months back and it's already pretty beat up.  it works but isn't great quality.  i would recommend getting some at at&t or sprint for a few more bucks.  if you don't mind changing the cover ever few months these are a good cheap option.
0	I expected the mirror screen protector to be like the one i have on my iphone right now. Instead it's a cheap funhouse mirror type of mirror...who wants to look at that??
2	The screen protector was ok. It protected the screen perfectly as it should but it  got scratched pretty easily. There were scratches all over the edges where the film was under the case edges. I had to change films pretty often due to the scratches. Good thing it was a 5-pack.
2	These are really inexpensive screen protectors that look a little bit better in the photos than in real life.Pros:Protector is slightly thicker than the protector that came with my 3G.It is easy to fit over your screen for application if you go slowly.The mirror effect is cool in itself.Very easy to apply without bubbles forming.It is very inexpensive.Cons:The mirror effect is not like a mirror but more of a flat silvery color.The cover shows minor scratches very easily.Bubbles can be taken out with a credit card but minor scratches occur.Unlike a clear screen cover this one has a fine grid but you can easily see past it.Brightness (outdoors) makes reading a little difficult.For the price and for what you get it is a deal.  It is simply a matter of what you want your iPhone to look like.
2	I bought a bulk of these last year and finally ran out.  They are thicker than ordinary screen protectors but does not hinder the screen sensor.  Only negative is that during daylight it is hard to see whats on the screen.
0	These do not work well.  You cannot see the mirror portion and it is very difficult to apply.  I would not try a product similar to this again in the future.
2	theyre a little hard  to put on without getting bubbles butttt they do give u 5 andd it works great as a mirror which i never carry around. lol i love it
2	Had to part ways. If your going to use this protector for indoor use only than this is for you but outside in daylight forget it. Even with the brightness turned all the way up you can barely see the screen this is the only drawback to this protector otherwise looks and works great inside and at night.
2	I do like this product for several reasons 1.  It is a mirror 2. It protects my original screen 3. It prevents nosy people from looking over your shoulder trying to look at your phone to see what you are doing because it is too dark for them to see and 4. It just makes your phone look cool.  Now I don't like this product because when you are outside in the sunlight it is very hard to see your screen.  So if that is not something that bothers you then this is definitely the product for you
2	THESE COVERS ARE COOL BUT IN DAYLIGHT OR OUTSIDE ARE WORTHLESS you cant see your screen if you are in any light what so ever
2	the product works great if you like to look at yourself. but visibility is very poor in most situations.
2	It was easy to put on fit well holes in the right place. Had a good mirrored finish and you could see through it without much difficulty.I decided that I didn't like it that much. Somewhat hard to see in bright sunlight but that would be expected. Price was right.
0	didnt fit my iphone cheaply made but they came very fast iwas very suprise at how fast i got them but didnt fit
2	It was a good price you can't go wrong with 1 dollar protector they are not the best of the best but they work.
0	these are nearly impossible to put on without getting bubbles from dust.... I went through all 5 before i gave up completely.
0	This product is slighhhhhtly bigger than the iPhone screen big enough to leave bubbles at an edge no matter how it is aligned. I spent some time to try to fit it and gave up after the second sheet to decide to throw away the whole package.Don't bother to buy it.
2	a fine product for keeping your screen from getting scratched  also good if you have broken your screen to keep glass shards together
0	Don't waste your time on this product.  The backing will not peel off so you can't use them.  The screen protector appears to be very thin but I couldn't tell for sure b/c I couldn't actually get to the protector in order to apply it to my phone.  There is a little tab on the side to help you peel it but it simply wouldn't separate the backing from the screen protector--I returned these as defective even though it's not much money--It's the principle of the thing. Cheap shoddy stuff.
2	It took so long for this item to come but when I did receive it I was finally able to protect my screen.  I thought it was suppose to be here before the first of the month but it did not come until the 3rd of the month.
0	Another gentleman who gave this product one star said it all for me. The product has a tab to help you put the protector on the phone... the tab does not come off completely so you are left with some sort of ugly goo that will not scratch or smear off. There is no way to get all the bubbles out and my package did not come with a card to help me remove the bubbles. I used 3 of the 5 screens so far and they all look horrible. Not sure why others gave it more than one star.
2	receive very fast they where where very cheap however i have not use them yet.. I hope that they will be easy to install onto the phone.
2	they don't stick well enough to last long enough have to replace them every 2 weeks. the sticky on the backing doesn't last.
2	good Price for so many screen protectors. kind of tricky to put on that{s probably why so many in the package just in case you mess up
0	There's a reason why this is so cheap - i should have guessed but until i find a better one it will have to do. The seller is probably trying to get rid of inventory at a loss.- The size is off; it doesn't cover the glass entirely - it's too narrow and too long. When it comes to protectors being off even a half a mm is a pain. That's why even if you know how to put these on you're gonna go through a few to make the adjustment for wrong sizing. I went through two.- The plastic is super cheap so your fingers will not glide on it. Which means they get sticky like if there's some kind of glue on it. That also means that you're not gonna be able to get all the bubbles out. I still have two small bubbles i can't push out from underneath.- And this is probably the biggest problem - the plastic film is so cheap that it has a rainbow effect; if you look at it from most angles you will see the rainbow unevenness going across horizontally. It's like what you see when you mix water and gasoline. It's very annoying.Save yourself the trouble and disappointment - don't buy this product.
0	Very terrible protection too glossy and it bubbles ridiculously its horrible. Came in a pack of five went through all of the them in 2 days. Sucks
2	it protects the screen fine. out of the package there was a crease on the top of it which left a bubble on it.
2	again like my other review the zagg ones look and feel better than this but again this is a cheap quick replecment to hold u over and protect screen till your zagg comes in i guess.
0	Horrible quality get what you pay for.  Reminds me of the plastic that comes on a fruit roll up. I will never buy these again I bought something else that was shipped together and thought it was free ones that they sent as a compliment.
2	I applied the first one to my phone and the left and right edges about .25 on both sides just will not adhere. I put one on my wife's phone and the same thing. I took mine off started fresh even cleaned the screen with rubbing alcohol and put on gloves... same problem.
0	These are a waste of money to me because they put this white paper tab on them and once you put it on your phone you can't get the stupid tabs off them.
2	I got these for my wife's iPhone 3G and I have to say they weren't terrible but I have seen a lot better. I had to throw away two before I got one to stick without bubbles because they're pretty thin. More expensive versions I've never had an issue with. I guess you get what you pay for.
2	I bought this for an iphone 3g it fits perfect. although it's my daughter phone and for some reason unknown it came off. Not sure if my daughter was playing with it or it just came off.
0	These protectors love smudges and the oil from your fingers.  They do protect the screen but were a major disappointment.  Look elsewhere.
2	It's OK.. Have seen better though.  Probably wouldn't buy again.  Not would not recommend these screen protectors but the cloth lint is great for cleaning your reading glasses after you have used up the 5 screen protectors in about 5 weeks!
2	Seem okay but don't last that long. They seem to peel up pretty quick and HEAVEN forbid you get any spot of dust....it will ruin the whole thing.
2	I used three of these. I had to trim them a bit they were difficult to install and I did not end up using them very long because they ended up making my phone look kinda junky. They offered some amount of protection but they seemed to scratch up quite easily whereas the 3GS glass was quite scratch resistant on its own. Since these would not in any way protecting your screen from breaking I decided that it wasn't worth having them on as they only made my phone look a bit crap.
2	really hard to put on phoneblew thru 3 of them before I got one right. I would not try them again
2	These screen protectors are okay for what they are. What I wasn't told is that they aren't necessary for the phone
2	Good Product fits iphone 3g well.protects from scratches.great price for phone protection.I wouldn't pay for the expensive ones in the store
0	They left a lot of bubbles after applying. I spent a good amount of time trying to work them out but still some remain. And I as I was writing this my 16 month old daughter pulled it off the phone sooo they aren't that sticky either. I'll be throwing them out. Waste of money. Don't buy.
2	I purchased these for my old iPhone 3 but with the new glass on the iPhone 4s and 5 we don't need screen protectors anymore. I had difficulty getting these on the phone without bubbles but they did do a great job of protecting the glass.
2	They're pretty nice except they're not so easy to fit on the screen. They had little residues which created all sorts of bubbles around them. If you don't pay attention when you try putting them up you'll get a dalmatian looking screen! And when you try to get rid of those things they don't glue the same as the first time so it gets all messy around the corner. Think twice before you buy them.
2	Works just fine. I had no problems with it and it worked as good as any that I have used.
2	These do protect the screen from scratches and falls (I've dropped mine face-down way too many times).  But it also makes the screen a little hazy.
0	All five protectors were bent and would not adhere to the iPhone on the edges.  Poor quality.  I'd rate this zero stars if that were allowed.
0	It took forever to receive these since they come from China.  Also it is almost impossible to install these without getting a speck of dust or an air bubble under it.  Then it looks like crap.  Just buy a good case.
0	I did not like this product.  Very difficult to apply to screen.  Air bubbles are terrible to get off the screen.
2	This product was substandard and not worth it to me to buy..will not be recommending in the near future...Do not care for....
2	Bought these fo my iphone but they didnt work to great. Came off my phone in just a few days. Not a good value.
0	These screen protectors came as part of a combo purchase recommended by Amazon.  I ordered a charge/sync cord and wall charger for my iPhone and the best price available included these screen protectors.  I needed to replace the one on my phone as it had a scratch nothing minor so I had been putting it off. When these arrived I pulled off my old protector cleaned the screen on my phone very carefully and started to put on the first one. It apparently came with dust already attached to the sticky side so I ended up with a small bubble under the protector.  I also noticed that it had a very noticeable kind of swirly rainbow look to it under the lights in my office. I decided that since I got five of these I would try again.  I managed to get it on a bit crooked on my first try and discovered the rainbow effect again.  Since I had three left I decided to give it one last try.  I got it on straight this time but once again ended up with a piece of dust on the underside of the protector and the rainbow effect was still there.Don't waste your money on these.  I threw the last two away.
2	Great that it came in a five pack  No matter where you order from it still comes from China. Better than the $10 one pack at the stores.
2	HARD TO PUT ON AND DOESNT TAKE AWAY ANY GLARE. IF YOU LIKE A CLEAR PICTURE THOUGH ITS FOR YOU
2	I bought iPhone 3GS for my family member few weeks back and to protect the screen I decided to buy a cheap and good screen protector. I read some nice reviews about this product and decided to give a try for $1.00. They delivered 5 pack of screen protector (Good thing) but unfortunately none of them worked so well. All my 5 front side screen protector are went bad. Some of them gave me bubbles some came off right away after sticking on the screen for 3 minutes. Very cheap material. If you even try to put on screen protector very accurately by following their methods and procedures then also it will leave some bubbles. Putting on screen protector you will get some scratch. For me it was a bad purchase. I would definitely not going to recommend this to anyone. Pay little bit extra and get good quality and durable screen protector.
2	Mine give really bad bubbles but they do the job and I will most likely get it again just because it is a great protector.
2	They did not work for me that we'll I wouldn't really buy more of these they even feel like bad material.
2	This headset arrived promptly and looked to be in good shape. It paired easily with my LG Android phone (even tho I had never worked with a Bluetooth device before - it was easy!) and my older LG phone. It seemed to function well for the weekend that I used it. It didn't fit my ear very well but I adjusted it until it was reasonably secure. The audio was fine and the party on the receiving end said they could hear me distinctly so I thought everything was going well. Then yesterday it stopped functioning totally! I couldn't turn it on the only way I could get any life out of it was to plug it into the charger- the red charging light would come on but then would go off after a short time. Let it stay on the charger awhile then tried again. No go. No life. Dead. I can only assume it was an initial failure. I'm not going to fault Plantronics because I've used their products before in an office environment and they were very dependable. However this IS a discontinued model and if you want any replacement parts such as ear tips etc. be prepared - I couldn't locate any parts for this model even from the Plantronics people. Probably a good deal if you just want a cheap throwaway headset to try that's easy to operate.
0	It didn't work even after I charged it 24 hours. I tried many ways and nothing. It was only included headset and wall charger. No instruction manual included. I have returned it to seller with my own expense shipping charge. I am waiting for the full refund from the seller for they said so.
2	This device did not perform at all as well as I expected from a Plantronics product. The range is very poor and the noise level is completely unacceptable even inside in quiet environments. Outside in even mildly breezy conditions it is unusable. I will be returning it and replacing it with another Discovery 925 that I lost a couple of weeks ago.
2	The range of this bluetooth is very poor. You can't walk more than 3ft away from it before it starts to sound flaky. The headset is comfortable and battery life is really good. Other problem I had was that when I use it while driving people say that it sounds like i'm driving with the windows down when I'm actually not. I wouldn't recommend this product because of the sound clarity and range. $10-$20 more will be worth it.
2	I just bought this piece of junk. I didn't use it the first night. I then charged it up overnight and used it. Seemed to work okay but had some interference probably from the WiFi hub I have about 10 feet away.When I let it charge overnight (like I charged it initially) I woke up and found the red charging indicator was out. Good. Fully charged. Then I tried to turn it on. Nothing. Dead. Nada. Okay I'll just plug it back in Maybe 2-3 minutes later the charging light stops. Let's try turning it on again. Nothing. Dead. Nada.Had I been ripped off? I doubted it. I've had a lot more problems with eBay than Amazon which is why I switched. Being the problem solver I am I searched Plantronics 220 won't turn on. The best advice I got from NON-PLANTRONICS people (AKA other costumers) was to take the cover off and short the battery. I didn't want to muck around THAT much so I called Plantronics customer service. I called after hours and the system referred me to Plantronics.com. Thanks for nothing.Got up today and called again business hours. THEY STILL REFERRED ME TO PLANTRONICS.COM AFTER 2 PROMPTS. Great people right? So I went ahead and pried open the cover which is easier said than done and shorted the battery for a little while. Pressed the let's make this do everything button and it turned on. SAVED! HALLELUJAH! Still worked with my phone. Then a couple minutes later it died. Now I'm back to the troubling task of charging the stupid thing up. Will I have to pry it open again? Hopefully not.TL;DR? Don't buy Plantronics. Never again... 2 stars because it worked for a while.
0	The Plantronics 220 just doesnt work. It pairs it connects and it gives you a static filled connection even when holding the phone in your hand more than two feet away. Just garbage. The plantonics Voyager 510 - now THATS a headset-- can leave a phone thirty feet away and it goes through two walls in that distance. The 220- garbage. Also beware buying so called Motorola bluetooth earpieces on a 'bay auction site. They are mostly counterfeit and work just as poorly as a real Plantronics 220.
2	It is a good product.  Came shipped on time and packaged well.  My daughter loves having her phone back up and running again.  Thanks..
0	so just wanted to up date my last review. I still haven't recieved my order apprently lost in mail and company said on may 20 they would resend order. so three day now and no shipping info but will see
2	I only text and do email - no music or surfing and the battery just does not last. Frankly the original was not good either but much better than this.
0	DOES NOT WORK! DO NOT BUY STUFF FROM Sold by: The OEM ShopTHEY MAILED ME 2 DIFFERENT CABLE AND BOTH DAMAGE!
2	It's not that great it usually charges when it wants to. Sometimes it will synch and charge and other times it will say that it's not supported.
0	As with many third-party cables it just doesn't fit the phone as well as the original. The one I got feels gritty when attaching it like it's grinding on  the connectors when it shouldn't be. I should have known better.Update: As expected it broke under normal usage in less than 1 month. AVOID.
0	this is not good.this product never worked as advertised.When i plug into computer I get this warning on Iphone and I quote. this device is not supported by IphoneSo i thought Hmm maybe they are not telling the truth(IPHONE) so i left it hooked up for 6 hours and it did not charge 1 %.the company contacted me after last negative review i gave on this product. They sent me another. this is a review of the second one.I will give these to any one who wants them. Opps first one is in trash. I have no use for a product that doesn't do what it was advertised to do.
2	It charges and syncs my iPhone4 but I haven't tried it with any other apple products.  The item is NOT as pictured but it connects/syncs/charges.  It may not work with some cases (had to remove case to get adaptor to fit and charge)Not bad for the price though.
0	Cable went bad after a month but being that it was only $3 bucks I guess I cant complain. Spend the extra $$ and buy an original.
2	The cable is not premium in any way but it does work exactly as described.  The cable is stiffer than the original Apple cable and the connectors don't seem quite as firm when plugged in.  But it works so I am using it.
2	This item can charge some phones but not other ones. It will charge my Samsung Galaxy S but doesn't work for my Samsung Exhibit II so YMMV.
2	Not sure if it was the blackberry or the battery itself but this did not last very long. I since got a new phone so I dont have that problem anymore.
2	I own/use a Plantronics 925 Jawbone Prime and Jawbone Icon.  The Plantronics fits my ear great but doesn't decent noise canceling.  Both Jawbones have great audio but I found the Jawbone Prime's ear loop fragile and the buttons to be awkward; and found the Jawbone Icon's earloop to really suck (keeps coming off when I take off the headset and the loop gets caught).  Hence I am trying the Sound ID 200 more for its ergonomics.For my particular ear I found the Sound ID 200 to fit pretty well using the just the earlobe piece without the loop.  Of course you mileage will vary here.The Sound ID 200's speaker was acceptable to me.  Voices came across naturally and the volume levels were fine.Unfortunately the Sound ID 200's mic results in my voice sound noticeably tinny to those I'm talking to when compared to the Plantronics and the Jawbones.I didn't find the button use on the Sound ID to be that difficult at all.  You do need to read the instructions though.One potential annoyance: the Sound ID 200 does not support initiating voice dialing from the Sound ID 200 like I can on other headsets.  The instructions have you push the appropriate voice dialing button your phone to get things going.  If the phone or headset happens to be in sleep mode and your bluetooth connection isn't currently active when you do this you may not get the voice dialing feature to automatically start using the headset.I'm returning the Sound ID 200; it's not performing as well as I would like to replace my other headsets.  Might look into the more expensive Sound ID units to see if the microphone quality issue gets addressed.
0	HURTS THE EARWHERE IT HAS A CORNER ON THE BACK SIDE THAT PRESSES INTO THE EAR AND STARTS TO HURT THE SOUND IS OK BUT NOT THE BEST WONT GET LOUD ENOFF.
0	Although the most comfortable headset I have EVER worn NO ONE could hear me unless it was angles juuuuust right on my face.  And worst of all unless the phone is about 2 ft away from the headset it will not stay connected.  I either had to hold the phone or place in my shirt pocket. I returned it after 1 week.I DO NOT recommend this headset.
0	As the Sound 20 is no longer a current model the price has dropped significantly--I paid around $20 for mine. At that price it is a good bargain for anyone who wants a plain vanilla headset with decent sound quality. I find that the sound itself is excellent--far superior to any other bluetooth headset I've used. The device is simple and thus easy to use and the design is a notch better than most of the devices out there. As for fit the device sits in your ear rather than over it though there is an optional ear loop. I find that it nestles comfortably in my ear so that I don't notice it's there. The downsides are that because it's not a current model there are a number of things it can't do and in addition I find that the range is not that great--sound degrades rapidly once the earpiece is not in a direct line with the phone or other device.The device has one multicolored LED which is difficult to see if you are not looking directly at it. Mine came in the original packaging with additional ear pieces and was black not blue so I can't comment on the color. If you just need a headset (earpiece) for calls (no music) and can live without voice recognition this can be a good buy.Update and why I changed this review from three to one star: Product was ok while it worked but item's internal battery stopped holding a charge after less than a year. Even though it is moderately inexpensive that's substandard performance in my opinion since the item is worthless once it can't hold a charge.
2	It looks sleek and gets a lot of good reviews but in my experience it has not performed to expectation (not that I have particularly high standards). My chief complaints:1) the little rubber ear pieces that are supposed to hold it in your ear make for a good fit. BUT they incessantly break forcing you to buy and replace them constantly.2) it is supposed to offer simplified use with only 2 buttons. BUT it requires you to figure out which combination of buttons to press how long to hold it when to let go and what to do next. It makes it surprisingly difficult to use. For example I want to pair it with the phone but end up turning it off instead. (Does anyone else have this problem or am I just incompetent?)3) minor annoyance but often times it is difficult to tell if it is on or off. So often times I think its off and I try to turn it on just to find out that I just turned it off. The different colors on the light are supposed to indicate its current on/off state but I just never seem to have good luck with it. (Again may be it is just my incompetence?)However there are some nice aspects: it looks sleek and is compact fitting nicely in the ear. Battery life seems to be ok as well. I never found much use for the dual microphone noise reduction capability. People on the phone always told me that they could hear no difference when I used it.As a result of the challenges I found with it I rarely find myself using it anymore. So the long and the short of it is that I am not very satisfied certainly not at the price. My personal opinion is that it does not offer good value considering how much you are forking out on it.I used the Plantronics Voyager 510 before and was quite satisfied with it before I lost it. Yes it was a little bit large but very usable long battery life etc. And it is less than half the price of this one. Based on my experience I would recommend that one.Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging]
2	GOOD MAILING TIME CAME IN USED  I COULD SEE THE DENTS AND SCRACTHES ON THIS BATTERY NOT IN PACKAGING IN A PLASTIC COVER IT IS NOT NEW USED OR JUST IN BAD SHAPE BUT AND I SAY BUT IT IS WORKING VERY WELL.
0	I got this from ACC Stop at the end of May.  It was for my daughter so she can stay connected.  She probably charged the phone maybe 6 times since she doesn't use it much.  It died while on vacation and never accepted a charge back up.  Bad Battery.
2	It does charge the phone (battery) but I think it has a bit of a sloppy connection and may not fully charge.  We used it about 6 months and then I bought a factory replacement and a fresh battery.  The connection on the new charger seems to snap in a LOT better than this one ever did.
2	Had problems with several defective items but they replaced 2 chargers so far still don't have one that works but was promised one. I am hopeful..
2	This product arrived on time and in good condition. The quality could be a little better it's a little thin and the length could be a little longer.
2	Very light duty only; if you have a device that requires a 1 Amp adapter then get a better cable. This will work for a short time only. It should always be fine as a data cable but not as a charger.
0	When I searched for a Samsung galaxy s3 charger this product popped up. When I received it in the mail it did not even fit my phone.
2	I ordered it thinking that this was a Samsung cable but when it arrived I was really disappointed not only was it not as long as the original but it was very poorly made. The quality was very poor and the shipping took incredibly long. It works just fine but feels cheap and is cheap I guess you get what you pay for.
0	These cables are great for stuffing into a bag or using at home or in the car. They're not too stiff and the cables are thin enough to avoid being bulky.** update **After some strange charging issues over the last few months I've determined that these cables can carry data but little to no charge regardless of whether the power is coming from a battery pack wall wart car charger single USB port or Y-cabled double USB port.On the other hand it's strong and flexible enough to tie a door open.
0	These cables do not look like the PRIMARY picture.  They are extremely short and have the big head to it. I did not look at every picture so in the end it was my fault. Alternatively I shouldn't have to look at every picture when the primary picture is a complete false advertisement of what it looks like.The cord also falls out of my phone VERY easily. Don't bump it.I would end up losing money to return this so I'm stuck with it. The best advice I can give is spend a little more money and get one that actually looks like what they falsely lead you to believe it SHOULD look like.The shipping took over 2 weeks as well. And you can NOT track your items with this company. After emailing them I just got an email back saying it should be there by the end of the week but there is no way for us to know when. 2 weeks is not 3 - 5 business days.
0	I bought this to use to charge my cell phone plugged it in and left it overnight. The next morning it said fully chargedunplugged it and it was not charged even a bit... It may work for some it didn't work for me!
0	This cable does not work with Galaxy S4. It is clearly not Samsung OEM (which is obvious from the price) but it does not work at all which makes it a piece of garbage.
0	Cable didn't work when I got it - pinching the correct spot on the phone end seemed to make it work but it was obviously internally defective.Seller immediately refunded me.
2	I'm not convinced that this cable is authentic.  It like the other set I purchased has its faults but I don't use it enough to be 100% sure if its the real deal So I will say at this time its OK .
0	How hard is it to make a charging cable? I bought two of these for my Galaxy Nexus and my Nexus 7 they don't work. I tried them in a car charger and in an AC charger (both of which work extremely well with other cables). In the car charger I got nothing in the AC charger one would work at AC if you wiggled it enough if not it did nothing. The other worked as USB instead of as AC. I got the same results with both the Galaxy Nexus and the Nexus 7. Absolute junk stay away.
2	I bought this just to have a spare around the house and have no complaints regarding it.  Nothing really makes the cord &#34;special&#34; but as a USB cable that hasn't broken after all this time I'm pleased with it months later.
2	Came much shorter than I expected but it still did the job. Just don't expect this to stretch very far
2	Works well. Had some trouble with it charging my phone initially because it was too loose but propping it up on something helped. Not sure if its my phone or the charger.
0	I sent for charging cords from three different places hoping that one would work for my Samsung SII phone.  This one did not charge at all.  The one I ordered from Wireless Hub Brooklyn NY worked immediately.
2	Says its arrived but I have not got it yet I will update this once it comes in and I can use it on my phone.
2	This cable &#34;Samsung Replacement USB Data Charging Cable for Samsung SPH-M330&#34; is good and strong. My issue is that it is to stiff or rigid.
2	worked pretty good for a while until recently few weeks ago kept getting more loose when plugged into phone then just wouldn't charge anymore after some significant jiggling around.  oh well not bad for a $2.50 purchase.  the other imitation i bought with the more straight ahead plug not the slanted to the side like this one actually fit better and still charging strong!
0	Stopped working after just a few week. You get what you pay for. At least I am only out a few dollars.
2	The picture for on this product listing is innacurate as I did not get a Samsung replacement cable but a cheap generic one. Can't complain too much its only a buck and change but this is just to let people know the picture is not what you will get.
2	Ignore the Samsung name on this cable. It might well be a name branded cable. But it's not a particularly good cable--brand name or not. First off it's relatively thin similar to off-brand bargain basement cables. To be honest this isn't a critical issue--even a thin cable can work. But it doesn't speak well to the longevity of the cable or to the workmanship that likely went into it. (Let's face it this is just a simple cable; but if they cheap out on cable thickness who knows what the quality of internal construction might be).The second thing about this cable is that it's quite short--about 32 long or a bit over 2.5 feet. That's OK for something attached to your laptop that's going to sit right next it but it's too short to be comfortable for a general purpose phone charging cable for example.OK it's cheap. And I have used worse cables (even thinner). But just be aware of what this is particularly the length when deciding if this is going to be of use for you.
2	I bought these two of these cables looking to replace damaged Samsung ones that I had laying around. I needed them for data cables and charging of my GS3. When I got them much faster than I expected I was pretty happy at first till I used them.They aren't the style in the photo nor are they replacement cables for Samsung. They take about a minute to register with the computer that the phone is plugged in (upwards of 2 minutes) and when connected they don't allow sync to occur.When used as chargers (plugged in to USB outlet adapters) they take over 10 hours to get a dead battery to 80%! I though it could be the charger  so tried different ones. Also tried other devices (a Mifi my GS3 a cheap Samsung flip phone) all with similar results: Mifi - from dead to 77% after 8 hours; GS3 - 10% to 60% after 7 hours; basic flip phone: dead to 75% after 8 hours.I also tried the other cable and repeated my tests: same results.I'll keep these to keep the charge (it'll keep my GS3 at it's current level for hours as long as it's not under heavy usage) but I'm looking for better ones after this.
2	Fits pretty loose in my GN.  It's ok but you have to make sure the cable doesn't fall out.  Most of my usb cables fit so nice that I could pick up the phone from the cable.  Certainly not the case with this cable.
2	you get what you pay for. looks similar to actual cable.  broke within 1 day of use. wires showing thru cable.  buy better quality cable.
2	I bought this cable a few months ago and it worked fine until I dropped my phone about 2 feet off my lap on to the floor while my charging cable was plugged in.It unfortunately landed on its end pinching the micro end of the cable causing it to split the plastic at the connector point causing complete failure of the cable.The plastic was very cheap and molding weak.I am going to try buying a better brand.
0	These do not work in my ZTE Warp or my Samsung Preval. I order (6) of them now I'm stuck with them shame on me!
2	Right after getting this the plastic around the phone connector broke exposing the wires. It still charges but it slides out too easily. That said I still use it. it works just real shoddy build.
2	After I recieved these cords I had to go check the ad again - how could I have missed that these were super short cords?  They wouldn't sell many if they put the legnth in the headline.  So if you need a cord that less than 3' long this might be for you. Maybe if you wanted to charge from your PC? Otherwise this cord is pretty useless.
2	It works.  It is far shorter than I had hopes.  My guess is that is why they show you a partial image that doesn't give you the true picture of what they're selling.  Your usual deception.
2	The plug has started to fail it does not stay in place all the time yet it will still charge it was definityle priced right.
2	Works as well as original however it was shorter than I expected.The quality is good and the connects firmly.
2	Cable is hardly a foot long. I can't even connect it to my computer's USB ports and leave my phone on my desk it's so short. Real samsung cable is well over a meter long almost 2 meters. This is less than 2 feet.
2	Its just the USB cable and it works. the cable is short so buy longer one instead if you need. The cable seems to be original samsung cable with name on it.
0	I only had this a few weeks before it broke! It's really hard to find a cheap quality replacement USB cable. This was NOT the one.
2	it was not long enough and didn't it really charge my phone at times and its not durable. It is good if you just need a back up for a day
2	It's ok for the price and length but it takes forever to charge my phone I'm use to a pretty quick charge and this is not it. It will get the job done but not in a timely manner.
2	Way too short of a cable to do pretty much anything. Don't understand why they can't make a 4' cable so you can at least use it while plugged in. Product works fine just not very user friendly.
0	CHEAP! And flimsy! Not worth even the low price waste of money. Lasted maybe a week. Not even worth returning.
2	I have purchased many chargers for my Samsung phone on amazon and honestly the quality is just so so on them. Maybe I'm just really hard on chargers but I feel like they should last more than a few months. Spend the money and get a good quality one.
2	Appears to be Samsung from the labeling but only ~30 long. Barely enough for a computer to charge/mount/ADB but too short for a Mini Cooper to get from the CLA-to-USB to the dash. Too short to be able to plug into your computer and hold the phone.Definitely shorter than illustrated on the Samsung site. Definitely a different micro-USB plug than current OEM -- current ones have a small + and - on the back.These are going back to Amazon (purchased from Amazon themselves).Samsung 5' cable as shipped with T959V is ECC1DU2BBEUsing my left over Nokia cables which are a foot longer and a better length --USB CA101 Connectivity CableorNew OEM Nokia 5310 8600 Luna N81 Micro USB Cable CA-101
0	I received this cable and immediately noted that it not only deviated from what is pictured but that it was obviously a cheap fake cable. I used it for a while although it unfortunately necessitates removing my SGS3 from its Speck case. Today I discovered that after only a few months of very occasional use it has stopped transmitting data at all. So I am back to using the original cable that came with my phone.Do yourself a favor pay a little bit more and buy a quality Motorola or other branded cable.
2	the one I received almost seemed like it was used instead of brand new. went bad really quickly so I'd recommend if you want a good replacement cable just go to a store that will have less hassle to return it if it goes bad
0	Bad Samsung imitation. Does not work. The cable get loose on connection and it doesn't work. I though I have a deal but this time failed.
2	I constantly charge my phone so any cable is going to get a lot of use as I plug/unplug at least 5 times a day.  With that said I still think a cable should last more than a few months.  I purchased several of these and all have gone bad.  The problem is with the micro USB section.  The prongs that make the connection start to fail by not sticking up as much as they should.  When the problem first starts I have to wiggle the cord to make a connection.  It continues to get worse so that I have to wrap the cord around the phone and do other things to make sure it is plugged in at a certain angle.  Finally it gets so bad that I have to throw out the cable.  New cables fix the problem - it's not my phone.
2	When I plug this cord into my phone for the first time I had to wiggle it around to get it to make a connection. I have 3 other chargers that I don't have to wiggle to get to work. That's how my old one did before it stopped working entirely. That's why I bought this cord.Think it may have a faulty wire?
0	This cable dont work...im so dissapointed  this cable is junk cannot believe they sent me a cable that doesnt work  what a waste of my money and time!!!!!! Ahhhhhhrrrr s***
0	Horrible. Did not stretch long at all. If I wanted to plug in my phone to the wall it would have to sit on the floor. Plug was a USB but only worked in one phone.
2	i have an app that shows the actual charging rate. my original cord from samsung charges at 1 amp but this cord plugged into the same charging block only charges at 400 milli amps. My factory cord charges 2 1/2 times faster. you get what you pay for.
2	Cheap but it was cheap (not a bargain). As I've previously stated it works just charges very slowly. This is a get what you pay for item. I would buy again because I purchase these kinds of things for my teens (I refuse to spend $20-$30 for their replacements knowing it's just a matter of time before they break it).
0	Be aware of this product.It's not real Samsung product. I ordered 4 cables and every serial numbers are the same.It's a really faked one and may break your phone.The pin is too tight and if you use this too long time your phone's usb jack would not fit to any other genuine Samsung USB cable.Shame on Hongkong!I'm going to claim now!Update 5/4/12: Got an email from seller and they refunded full amount but I keep the one star review because of faked one (useless).
2	I bought these after seeing them for $9.99 at a local store- They work great I use for my Samsung Galaxy S 4G phone and a Comet phone.. No complaints they work great and awesome price!** Updated review * I bought these again 5/13- I have a note II and it takes along time to charge.. These aren't Samsung and seem bigger than the Samsung version- Have to be-careful they WILL rip your charging port out.. Won't order again..The second group two years later was generic.. Buyers beware for a newer Samsung Phone...
2	buy 2 of this usd data charging cables. one of this cables works fine without any problems. another one does not charge the phone. but for the price it is not bad.
0	I got it to replace my charger cable but thos cable is a waste of money in order to charge my phone it has to be at a certain angle I tried it in my wife's phone and it has to be wiggle to find the right angle in witch it will charge the phone.  If you are smart spend a little more and get a better cable.
2	Product does fit the micro USB jacks and does its job transfering data and charging.HOWEVER!!! You will not get the product that is pictured!! It's a scam... You will get a nockoff product NOT the actualSAMSUNG brand that is pictured.But it works... 3 stars because it's a valid product. but only 3 because it's not what it makes you believe it is.
2	This item is as described except my only complaint is that it wasn't actually a Samsung cable. I was disappointed. Plus it recently started glitching up (constantly stops charging and I have to wiggle the wire a bit to get it working again).
0	I bough a single cable and it did not work at all.  The price was so cheap that I went ahead and ordered two more.  They worked perfectly.  Guess this doesn't make your decision easier huh?
2	This arrived fast can't beat the price (I paid $1.69 with free shipping) and haven't had any problems with data transfer or charging.However this is a cheap Chinese knockoff NOT 3 feet as advertised (my OEM cord for my Samsung Galaxy is 3 feet). This is 6 too short which means if plugging into a wall outlet it has to stay on the floor - not long enough to reach the table. What a hassle if you have kids or pets.It only measures 2.5 feet and it's surprising how often that extra 6 matters. Also you can tell it's built cheaper than the OEM cord - I expect it will short out probably won't last 6 months.But hey for the price I can't complain too much. But if you don't want to mess around with a Chinese knockoff try this full length OEM replacement:RCA USB A to Micro B Cable.
0	Bought a pair of these cables and they took almost 3 weeks to arrive which was expected so issues there. The first arrived DOA never worked. The second died shortly after less than a week of use. Both cables are very short and barely reach anywhere. They had to be forced inside the phone connector which made me cringe every time. If you are looking for a charging cable look elsewhere even for under two dollars these cables are simply not worth it.
2	This product appears to be the exact replacement for the Samsung s3 cords But I meant to order the shielded cords for the S4.  Verified it's current and it was correct.  Gave as a present to my neighbor.
0	It failed after approximately six months of use. I would not buy this again in the future. i would come off better purchasing one at the store.
2	The good: it's a micro USB cableThe bad:  it's not what's pictured.  Not Samsung type small profile plug but larger connector that is hard to fit into some phones - particularly if the phone has a protective case.
0	Like others have said in their reviews this cable does not seem well-made at all.  I have tried to use it over the past several weeks.  Sometimes it charges and sometimes it doesn't--when it does it charges VERY slowly--like 4 hours to go from 40% to 100%.  Half the time the computer doesn't even recognize that my phone has been plugged in.  I do not recommend this product.
0	this equipment is obviously not a samsung product. it takes bare minimum 2 hours (uninterrupted) charging time to get a full charge with this cable and even then the batter dies quicker than usual. I would not recommend this product to anyone else. I purchased 2 of them and they are both horrible
2	Heavy use in my car has lead to the connection breaking near the usb plug end after about 2 months. While this cable is very flexible/pliable at room temprature my guess is that slightly below freezing conditions in my car stiffend the black outer layer of plasting leading it to breaking. Did I get what I paid for (namely a very cheap cable)? Yes.
2	Not exactly what i expected the normal Samsung cables are over a foot long and this was not. Disappointing but it still worked.
0	Cords looked good when I got them. Decent quality especially for what I paid. I then used them to connect my Galaxy S4 to my computer. Phone said it was charging but computer was never able to connect. No big deal since I figured I'd just use these with my usb plugs next to my bed and whatnot. Woke up the next morning and my phones battery percentage had actually gone down! I figured I messed up and accidentally turned the power strip off or something. That wasn't the case but maybe I didn't plug it into my phone good enough. I decided to take one to work to keep there and after plugging it in to many things with none of them working I connected my S4 to my computer and took note of the time and battery percentage. In one hour my battery went up only 2%!! What the what! After giving these cords the benefit of the doubt time and time again I finally found the best place for them the trash can. Thanks for nothing.
0	Despite the description and the pictures of a Samsung USB Data Cable what I received was a generic Micro USB cable that bears no resemblance whatsoever to what was pictured on line.  I would not have purchased this if I had known that I would receive a cheap generic substitute instead.
2	Did not last long stopped working after a month not very happy probably won't recommend ... Not very durable or useful
2	So this cable isn't a genuine Samsung cable however it will work for regular charging and data transfers from your phone to your PC/laptopI've tried it on both Samsung and LG phones and it just works fine for those 2 purposes ... but doesn't work if you try to ROOT your phone or do a manufacturer update.The tips aren't slim looking like the genuine ones you get with your Samsung phone they're bulkier and similar to the ones you get with an LG phone.AGAIN it won't work if you try to use it to update/root your phones ... but will work for regular data transfers (photos music etc)Hope this helps some of you deciding
2	this cable is too short. go with this instead:Samsung OEM USB Travel Charger Adapter with Data Cable MicroUSB - Bulk Packaging - Black
0	These actually discharged my Samsung Note 2.  I bought 3 and none of them worked.  I haven't checked to see if I can access pictures and music on the phone yet but at this point it is meaningless.  I have to buy more cords to charge.
0	This is a completely re-written review. This cable works on all my devices except for the Google Nexus 4. I bought three of these cables and none of them work on my Nexus 4. However these cables seem to charge and transfer data for Nexus 7 Motorola Droid 4 & Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. When I connect the cable to my Nexus 4 the phone would sporadically charge and disconnect every few seconds.Do not buy this if you are concerned that your device is incompatible with the cable.
2	It works as advertised. Fine for data and power. My one and only complaint is the length of it. Almost unusable. I know it was cheap but still they could of added six or more inches to make it more functional. Next time I'll spend a little more for some length.
2	I expected that I will have 40&#34; cable but it was 20&#34;. I am not sure if I missed any details when I ordered it.
2	I'm not keen on the short cable size (seems you have to dish out a lot of money for proper longer cables) but if you don't care about size these cables are great. They are ideal OEM cables (standard for just about any handset) and so far they've not died on me. I do recommend these again if you're not looking for anything particularly long).
0	Cables don't even charge the phones. You can tell they aren't official because the micro-USB end has a thicker plastic than the official samsung cables. I bought from a seller named Touch Global. ended up shipping from Pakistan or somewhere cant bother to return it I'll just count it as a loss and pay more for proper quality next time.
2	This charging cable works well and does not kind or bend in use or storage - Connections are strong and tight - best for good clean connections
2	I had it for about one week then it stopped working then again you get what you pay for CHEAP!
0	Maybe I didn't read the description thouroughly enough but this cord sure didnt work for the Samsung Precedent phone from the prepaid/pay-as-you-go plans. I was disappointed but was only out a couple bucks...
2	I've been using these cables for a while now and they work fine. They move data they charge... they do what they're supposed to do. However I noticed recently that my devices (Samsung GS4 and Nexus 7) charged more quickly on some cables than on others so I installed CurrentWidget and did a bunch of careful testing.Using my phone as an example it uses 460mA of power to function and I leave it on while charging. These cables will charge it at 1000mA (5W) total input power which leaves 540mA (2.7W) dedicated to charging the battery after subtracting what the phone uses. There's nothing wrong with that. But other cables are able to deliver 1.66A (8.3W) to my device which means that charging happens at 1200mA (6W) and charging happens over TWICE as fast.I have no real complaint with these cables but I prefer to use the other faster cables instead.
0	This charger broek within two days of getting and no help on returning it for it being falty. WOULD NOT RECOMEND
0	The seller Amamax is shipping a junk 3 foot generic charging cable. This cable will break within a week. The micro USB end will let loose from the insulation and render the cable useless almost immediately. Others have had good luck with OEM products but Amamax does not ship OEM products and they take a week to ship it...
0	I bought these to charge my Nexus devices (4 and 7) but they do not maintain a constant connection. I plugged in my Nexus 4 using these cables and the charging notification flickers suggesting that it was constantly losing connection and reconnecting. This doesn't happen with other micro usb cables that I've used.
2	I purchased two USB cables for my Samsung Captivate i897. The original one shorted out in less then 6 months that came with it in the AT&T box. The USB cables work for charging but when plugged to my laptop it doesn't allow me to use the phone it'll charge but when I try to use any app on the phone it just bounces around the screen. Other then that set back it works for charging and when I put the setting to debugging it'll work (when I tried updated to version 2.2 after the release was made by AT&T).
2	This charger will charge your phone.. as long as you don't try to use it at all while it's charging. If you try to simultaneously charge and use the phone.. the phone's power usage is much more than this charger's ability to charge. The stock cable that I received with my phone is able to charge while I'm using the phone. I'm not sure why this one is so weak..
2	This cord fits perfectly on my samsung galaxy s2 but the cord is not very long at all. It would definitely be nice to find a Samsung cord that is longer.
0	This is a fake. If you can even get the phone to recognize the cord it takes something like 12 to 16 hours to fully charge. Absolutely not acceptable.
2	They don't tell you how long this cord is.  The one I got was about 8 inches long.  That was a little less than expected.  I guess it works but I didn't know that they made them that short.
0	Again this product description says OEM by Samsung ... data cable... I cannot get it to work unless I giggle the connection to the phone.  I've tried it on other phones and get the same problem.  I give up trying to find a mini usb cable that will connect properly to a Samsung phone.
0	It came by the date that is the only good thing I can about it. It is short but that isn't the worst problem ! It doesn't stay in my phone. It takes my phone forever to charge. If I'm on it and its on the charger it makes the percent go down instead of up
0	Brought 3 of these to have around the house.  First one worked fine for about 3 months and then failed (no charge no data).  Switched charger and still no charge.  Tried using the other two (both still in original packaging).  Both didn't worked.  Would not transfer data or charge my phone battery.  Put the original phone charge cable into the charger and it worked fine so I knew it was the cable and not the charger.  To make sure I tried several other chargers.  Nothing.  Threw all three out.  A total waste of money.  It's been over 3 months so could not return the order.  Will not buy this again.  Would give it zero star if possible.  Very disappointed.
2	My husbands Samsung Stratosphere 2 will only charge on authentic Samsung chargers and cables.  It does not recognize this as a Samsung product.
2	It works but only for a limited time. Be prepared to have to eventually purchase another charger. But otherwise look for another charger to buy.
0	Seriously why don't they just make it last. I am pretty sure I went through two if not three of these. I thought I made a great find for a replacement cable for my GS2. But I threw both away. They would not connect well or be loose so it wouldn't charge. I had the hardest time finding the right cable. Ironically I found an amazing short and super long one that work awesome. The short Nokia CA-101D 8-inch Connectivity Cable for Nokia (search that on amazon) It connects well and is very solid. Should also work for GS3 but that I don't own. Then the long Mediabridge High Speed USB 2.0 A-Male to Micro-B Cable - 6 feet (also amazon) that is amazing quality just increadibly long! But good luck searching. Hopefully those two suggestions will help you find your answer. I have been through 4 or 5 different micro USB chargers and those two just mentioned have been the best!!!!!
0	Bad quality short thin and breakable. I recommend buying a blue rigger 6ft usb cable. Its cheaper and much much better quality. Don't waste your money on this.
2	I had 3 S9's..all worked great but after sweating into them while running the volume keys stop working..so off they go to Motorola.  Finally on the 3rd to UPS loses them sends me $100 so I buy the S9HD's.  Same deal..better quality than the S9's but after sweating into them a few times the volume keys went kaput again.  Volume goes to the lowest level and that's it.  So now it's off to Motorola again.  If it weren't for the fact that these are the best headset for running and the gym I wouldn't bother.  Being able to advance to the next song answer the phone..these are great but with limited use time.  Wouldn't be a bad idea to have 2 so there's always one around. No way they make it past the warranty of 1 year
0	It's even worse when my phone is in my pocket and I bend over but the sound will (sometimes) cut out every second or two while I'm holding the phone 18 away.  Checking with Motorola about warranty but really disappointing.
0	I originally bought the S9's which sounded O.K. but failed after one 30 minute workout with moderate sweating.  I said in a review of those that I was going to try the Jaybird's but I liked the S9's so much that I decided to try the S9 HD's instead.  I had read that the S9 HD's were much improved in sweat resistance.  Not true.On the positive I will say there is no comparison between the S9's and the S9 HD's as far as sound quality.  The HD's simply blow the older model away.  I was very happy with them initially although I was so paranoid after my earlier short lived experience that I found myself CONSTANTLY wiping the headphones off to make sure they didn't get wet while working out.  Well even that didn't work.  Sadly after only 3 workouts these too have failed.  This time the headphones themselves still function as well as the volume controls however the pause phone and forward/back controls have all failed.  Sigh...I really do want to like these headphones but they are obviously not an appropriate product if you want to use them for workouts.  At least they had the decency to fail within the 30 day return period!This time I actually did order the Jaybirds instead.  I know they don't have the same audio quality as these do but hopefully they will function for over a week!UPDATE:  I looked at my review this morning and decided that I was too harsh in rating these 1 star (although I can't go back and change that).  They really are very good as far as sound quality and if you aren't using them for workouts then you will probably really like them.  It's just the only time I ever use headphones is during workouts so for me at least they are unacceptable.
0	I decided to totally rewrite this review. I finally started using these again hoping I could cope with the worst bluetooth range I have ever seen to date and sorry I can't take it.Pros:The sound quality is great. It's some of the best I've ever had for Bluetooth Headphones.I haven't had sweat problems at the gym like other people seem to have had.They are very lightweight although it would be nicer if it was lower so you could lay down with them on.Cons:The rubber glue holding the power button rubber unglued itself.The battery life is about 5 hours... not bad for the size but not really that great either.Motorola technical support is some of the worst ever conceived it's a joke to even call it that.They bend pretty easy - if you take these on a road trip make sure they don't have /any/ weight on them. Mine bent to the left pretty heavy and took some time to bend back.But the real meat and potatoes is that THESE HAVE THE WORST WIRELESS RANGE IN THE HISTORY OF WIRELESS.I have to put my phone in my hood to get the sound to not cut out nonstop. Pockets? Sorry you are SOL. Like working out? It works kind of. Biking with your phone in your pocket is a long lost dream. I didn't buy these - My HT820 (which by the way was AMAZING compared to these) went in for warranty and they sent me these back. No charger no manual nothing but these in a box (and they weren't even bubble wrapped!) and then when I contacted them about it they said my warranty had expired. That might be due to the fact that it TOOK NEARLY 3 WEEKS to get a response. Getting an RMA on my previous set so bad that I am never buying Motorola again.Overall I really dislike these headphones because there is no practical use. Look at the 1 star reviews and you'll see what I have.I cannot repeat this enough: DO NOT BUY THESE SAVE YOURSELF THE HORRORS OF THIS PIECE OF TRASH (for lack of better words)Update: I have upgraded to the Nokia BH-905i - I like BT headphones and I'm not going to throw my money away on another pair of these losers. The sound doesn't cut out on my (new) phone with the new pair - it still does with the old (these). When I did upgrade my phone (from when I wrote the top part of this review) I tested out the BT range and sadly the problem did lie in these headphones. I want to like them but with all of the problems there is nothing about these to like.
0	This is the first bluetooth headset that I bought. The first few days it worked ok but I noticed I had to recharge it after every couple of hours that was used. Then I started hearing a lot of static noice (I was not walking around sitting next to my laptop). Bottom line don't waste your money there is a reason this headset was so cheap. Who knows maybe a more expensive one does a better job.
0	Actually no it kept turning off and on and i dont know the reason so yea it didnt work it was a really very bad one ! Sorry
2	I put this battery in a troubled phone and after lots of tinkering the phone still died. So I can't tell for sure whether the battery had anything to do with that. But I love the tools! I've taken apart and fixed about 5 iphones with these tools. It's hard to find a small Philips screwdriver for the iPhone.
2	It worked really well for like the 1st  month or so and then it just stopped holding a long charge.it still works..dont get me wrong..but the life severely decreased..my average heavy usage day i would get at the LEAST 6hrs before im in the yellow..now its more like 1 and a half hours now. Instead of investing in more off brand product i decided to buy a new phone.
0	Have bought from this same product link 6 months ago and that one was OK.  This latest purchase however only lasted about 3 weeks and now it does not hold a charge drops rapidly to zero after a couple of hours.  Again the one from six months ago is fine on the same phone.
0	I recently ordered a new battery from another seller for my friends G1 which was no longer holding a charge. The battery worked better than expected. My G1 battery began to die quickly even with limited use so I figured I'd get a new battery for mine as well. This battery did not work as well as the other I ordered. This battery seems to work just as bad as the original one I've had for a few years.When I received it it had about 70% life and I decided to fully charge it and then let it completely die before recharging. I've been using it for a few days and I charge it fully each night. By the end of the day which is around 5 or 6pm for me it's down to less than 20%. I rarely use my phone during the day while I'm at work. I even tried taking off the autosync feature to save battery life. Last night as usual I fully charged the battery. I've checked my email and received/sent a few text messages. It's now noon and the battery is at 44%!I believe there are some lower priced batteries out there that actually work. I don't think this is one of them. Try at your own risk. I'm just thankful I didn't spend alot on this.
2	I bought this for my android G1 about a year ago after the battery I had before died. It worked fine for a few months but it slowly started to drain like the old one.
2	If you want this phone because of the supposed IMAP client you might be disappointed.  There are other problems too but I'll start with the long one.If you have it already and set up your email by following all of the menu prompts you might like it just fine without realizing what it is actually doing.The way life ought to work and does on other phones:If you have an IMAP email phone and an email service which supports IMAP you get free push email (instant delivery not waiting for the next dial-up) with no extra charge beyond your data plan.  Very simple.Nokia doesn't seem to care.  There is an option for email alerts but it doesn't seem to actually work unless you agree to the terms of their new Nokia Messaging service.  Instead of the phone connecting directly with your email provider (eg GMail) the phone installs the Nokia application which connects with Nokia's server and that server at Nokia is actually connected with your email provider.  Not only is this a ghetto work-around but if you read the terms of the service it is only free until Nokia decides they are done testing it and want to charge you money.So you might be happily using what you think is IMAP push email on this phone and for all we know it could stop working next month and Nokia could demand that you pay their subscription fee... for something which ought to just work anyway.No pretend that this doesn't matter to you or you think I am nuts etc.  On to the next problem.If your email provider has IMAP available the phone will not allow you to set it to download whole email messages.  The setting option which allows either headers only or header+body when you use POP3 is neutered when you have an IMAP server address and the only option is headers only.  So if you look at your phone and see several new emails every time you click on it you have to wait for it to connect and load the email.  My SonyEricsson w595 is not so stupid.  I have instant IMAP delivery and get the body text automatically.So forget about the email client what about other Internet applications?Here's two problems with that stuff:1. You can't turn off the menu option which stupidly asks if you really want to allow a web browser to access the Internet... every single time you use it.  Other phones at least skip this if you installed a signed application (eg Opera or Bolt browsers).  The popup has no never ask option and there is no setting for it from the application manager either.  Only Nokia's own browser is exempt.2. The fancy e63 also lets you select an access point every time you do something which requires Internet access.  This would be a great feature if you use both WiFi and cellular and want to switch back and forth all the time.  But it's a total annoyance if you don't.  The e63 lets you turn this feature off for its own web browser but it still does it for everything else.  Google maps Bolt browser GMail application... every one makes you select the access point every time you use it.
0	i ordered the phone few days ago and it arrived today.  initially i was so excited that i got the package so fast even though i took advantage of using the free shipping.  but soon:my excitement turned into suspicion then surprise and finally angry:(suspicion)  the box felted a bit light(surprise)  the seal on the box was broken(ANGRY)  NO PHONE INSIDE THE BOX!!!it has the manual and the wall charger but the phone.  this is ridiculous not even the April Fools' day yet!i contacted Amazon immediately and another phone is on its way to my door.  i have purchased countless items from Amazon new or used but NEVER received empty box.  i appreciate Amazon's effort in resolving this problem quickly but still it looks Amazon is getting too comfortable being the #1 e-retailer for too long WAKE UP AMAZON.COM!
0	I ordered a pair of these.  One lasted a single charge the second didn't work at all.  If I could have given this product zero stars I would have.  Not worth the postage to return - kept the removable usb cables and threw the adapters away.
2	I used this charger for about 6 months pretty sporadically with my Droid X & Sansa Clip+ as the two primary recipients of recharges straight from the wall outlet as opposed to a computer's USB port.  Everything worked fine except I'd notice the units were slightly warmer to the touch than if they were charging from the computer or in the case of the Droid X from the Motorola shipped wall-to-USB charger.A few weeks ago I left my Sansa plugged in for a few hours for a full charge (usually takes about 3-4 hrs to charge from empty).  When I came back it was completely dead and very warm to the touch.  I smelled something that could've been burnt wires but could've just been the plastic--very hard to tell.  All attempts to restart the Sansa failed and I RMA'ed it.  I've since stopped using this adapter for any of my electronic devices.I can't blame the charger for the Sansa's death with 100% certainty so I'm giving it 2* instead of 1* but considering I don't feel comfortable using it ever again I'm not going to give it any higher rating.  User beware I guess.
2	It's a cheap USB charger.  Not sure how it can be messed up but the iPhone I had did not recognize it and begin charging.  Seller did ship a new one after testing it personally so I give the seller credit for standing behind their product.
2	I don't recall purchasing this product.  I no longer have the item so I assume it no longer works.  I will give it 2 stars for this....
2	These chargers are just okay.  I ordered 3 ... I have one that continues to work the others have stopped working for no apparent reason.  They were cheap and you get what you pay for.
2	The cover gives a good protection does not slide over table and gives a nice feeling when in hand (in $3 one cannot expect much). However there are many cons1. The lock is difficult to reach since the silicone is pretty thick.2. The case is lose and the side covers comes out in day to day handling.3. Dust very easily sticks to this cover giving it a dirty look.4. You cannot put the phone in your pocket with the cover on it doesn't slide into your pocket because of the rubber material. This a big problem for people who keep their phone in pocket (like me)Ended up ordering the Otterbox commuter case for $30.My suggestion do not waste your three dollars on this case.
0	I bought it after reading other good review about it.  Well it is good quality.  However it is too thick and stay loose with my phone.  What is the point to have a good quality cover but it is not sit tie to your phone so that you can not use it?  Well I can't use it but it is too cheap to return so I just threw it away.  Not recommend it.
2	After reading customer service problems with Jambox I bought my wife a Jabra Solemate for Christmas.  She wanted to use her iPhone 4s for music and as a speakerphone in her office at work.  The Solemate ($150) works perfectly.  After a couple days she said to me &#34;You've got to get one of these for yourself.&#34;  Well we can't really afford two $150 Bluetooth speakers so I searched for something less expensive.  I found this one.First thing.  Unlike others this does NOT use a USB-based adapter/charger but rather it uses a conventional AC adapter and AA batteries.  That means you can't power it with a USB port on the computer a USB AC Adapter or a USB car adapter and that's an inconvenience by modern standards.  Also the AC adapter is just that.  It will power the device but it is not a charger.  You could use rechargeable AA batteries in this but you'll have to charge them separately.As a speakerphone this device is only OK.  Speakerphone volume (with iPhone 4s) is so low you have to turn the volume up all the way.  That means when you get a call you must quickly hit the volume up and hold it until it hits max.  Then when you hang up the call just as quickly turn the volume back down or music will be too loud.  I suppose if you had a phone with separate volume controls for phone and music this could work better.  iPhone has one volume control though.The sound is pretty good albeit not the quality of the $150 Solemate.  Buttons on top of the device are handy.  Rewind-Pause/Play-FF Volume down/up Bass Boost Stereo widening PTT and Power.  Bass Boost has fairly little but noticeable effect.  Stereo widening similarly has little effect--mostly reduces volume and leaves a &#34;hole&#34; in the center of the sound.  PTT is for pairing and then to answer or ignore an incoming call.Pairing with the iPhone is easy enough and the pairing survives the device being turned of and on again. It doesn't have voice prompts and confirmations like the Solemate but at least the pairing instructions are on a label on the back of the device.  I also tried this briefly with an iPad with which it also connected easily enough--given the usual Bluetooth constraints (disconnect from one before connecting to another).  iTunes music played fine.  Netflix movie sound comes through very well on the iPad.Bottom line:  If you're buying this mainly to listen to music or movies on a phone or tablet it works well enough for about 37% of the price of the Solemate.  For music and movies I'd give it 4 stars (one off for the old-style power).  As a speakerphone device for the iPhone it's somewhat limited due to speaker volume issues.
2	This is a very small speaker which is great for travel.  I was not pleased with the sound enough to give it 4 stars but considering the price its better then one might suspect. With that being said I doubt you can find a speaker for 30 dollars that is bluetooth capable. Questions does anyone elses player not look like the one pictured here? The bluetooth/plastic piece is much longer in the front. Also...the flashing blue light drives m crazy. Taking a star off just for that. But I have to give it back due to the conference call ability.
2	I tried this one after striking out on a solar powered speaker system. While this one performs better than the prior it still doesn't pull it's weight for the money. I will be sending this one back as well.
2	New out of the box and the speaker pops and snaps and crackles with every beat of the song.  Too bad I was playing a violin sonata by Debussy.  When I listen to a song I want to hear the music not the hiss of poor received signal or the rattle of loose and broken parts.I knew that at the low price of the speaker that I should not expect much but I did not expect for the speaker to be of such poor quality.PRO: Bluetooth connectivity worked.  Came with batteries.CONS: Loud beeps every time a button is pressed.  Speaker is unusable due to all the noise it makes.Cannot recommend.
2	Materials are very cheap. Plastic face was scuffed when arrived. Sound quality was just OKNot recommended for my tastes.
2	It does what it says it does its not super impressive I've only used it a handful of times since I bought it.
2	The speaker connects to audio sources pretty well. Controls are a bit confusing but acceptable. Audio quality though has nothing to do with manufacturers claims: it is a small speaker with average audio meaning it is only usable to voice applications such as Skype or other VTC apps. It is not suitable for music playback.
2	The Spracht AURA BluNote Bluetooth speaker originally sold for $130 which is an absurd price considering its cheap build quality and barely acceptable sound quality. I purchased mine for about 60% less than that and still feel this speaker is an inferior value. The sound is simply too poor to make this suitable for any sort of serious music listening. No dynamic range or anything resembling bass. And forget about playing it loud. When a company releases a product this poor it makes me question it as a whole. Pass on Spracht and spend your money on brand that shows concern for product quality.
2	I purchased this speaker because I want to have wireless speakers for my nexus one. Actually I puchased Yubz MAGNUM and this unit.Both use 4 AA battery I soon realized this speaker does not support AVRCP as well as you have to connect from the host (a big hassle). I connect it as wireless headphones not handsfree.The volume and bass control are reset once you have battery replaced which is another hassle.Now I say the good side: the sound is pretty decent. The speaker has bass boost and stereo widening the former does really work.I never use handsfree speaker so I can't give comments.If you want to use it as wireless audio speakers and you want to control from the speaker you should go elsewhere.
2	first of all it sounds like crappy little cheap speakers which is basically what I was expecting so I can't complain about that. The bluetooth seems to work fine but I really only get about 20-25 feet if it is a clear line of sight even if I walk between my phone and the speaker it will cut out. There are also a few things about it that really annoy me. When you power the speaker on the volume is set so low be default that you cannot even hear sound coming from it even if my cell phone is turned all the way up. Once you get the volume at a decent level everything is great until you go to turn the speaker off it plays this cheesy chiming noise at the an outrageous volume level because that his how loud I had to turn up the speaker to be able to hear them. My initial solution was to just leave the speaker turned on and only turn on my bluetooth to connect when I want to listen to music however there is a flashing blue light on the front which lights up our entire basement when it flashes every 10 seconds. We just covered up the light but if it wasn't for the weird volume issues this wouldn't be a problem to begin with.
2	After a couple months of use I'm editing my review to take away one star.  All the below holds true but the blue light is actually incredibly annoying.  It flashes quickly and randomly as long as the unit is turned on so I end up hiding the speaker out of my line of sight.  It's a serious design flaw in a speaker that's obviously trying to be sleek modern and easy to fit into your decor.----I bought this little speaker to use with my Nexus One which holds about 12G of my music collection.  The convenience of the Bluetooth connection and the small footprint sold me on this model and it does not disappoint.Pros:1.  Setup was seamless and took a total of 45 seconds thirty of which was waiting for my phone's Bluetooth to recognize the speaker.2.  Size matters for a portable speaker and this one has a small footprint. The slight curve makes it stable enough to not worry about tipping but it takes up less desk space than my 5x7 digital photo frame.3.  Design is good with a nice sleek appearance.  The buttons have a good solid feel and they're nicely sized so there's no hunting around.4.  The sound is also very good but no one is going to mistake it for a full-size speaker.5.  The unit comes with an AC adapter four AA batteries and an Aux-in cable.  Everything I needed to get my Nexus One and iPod both connected in no time.Cons:1.  The sound does have some sibilance particularly on high notes.  It's not really a tinny sound - much better than most other portable speakers of this size that I've tried.  That said it's not going to blow you away with sound quality.2.  The blue lights on the front of the unit (not shown in the pictures) are well ugly and distracting.  Where the photo shows three connecting black circles the unit has blue circular lights when turned on.  Only the top circle is lit most of the time but it's pretty bright.  Definitely not a design enhancement and a downright annoyance if you want to sleep with this thing going.Overall I'm very happy with this speaker and am glad to have it.  The complete ease of connecting my devices the size and portability and the decent sound quality outweigh the negatives for me.  And since I bought it at the Goldbox price I'd say it was worth the money.  Not sure I'd be as happy if I'd paid the regular price though!
2	I had no trouble pairing this with my DROID X mobile phone and playing music through it at a reasonably high volume - the sound quality is what it is for this size speaker but that's not what I bought it for. I bought this to use as a speakerphone and in that regard it falls a bit short. The speaker volume is WAY down and not as clear as it should be - I have a Motorola speaker/speakerphone that's about a third the size of this and it works much better. I do like the fact that it uses 4 AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable battery that inevitably is dead when you want to use the speaker.
0	I heard the BOSE version of this style product but could not afford $300 so tried this $50 version.1st: the battery cover is flimsy: it was difficult to snap on and I was afraid I was going to break it.2nd: the stream was horrible. Maybe I got a lemon but every 2 or three seconds the sound would stop and then start again... very irritating.3rd: the blinking blue night is also a huge irritation! Stop the blinking and make it steady.------------------My wallet said &#34;SPRACHT!!!&#34; when it coughed up the dough for this toy.
2	So we got this today and before even getting the chance to open the Amazon box it was damaged.  We opened the Amazon box to find the product's packaging also damaged.  Not looking good.  We opened the item and looked at the included accessories and read the instructions and turns out you must charge this for 2.5 hours first.  No problem except that there is no wall outlet.  I hadn't noticed that from the images.  So I have to start the car and leave it charge for 2.5 hours?  I'm rarely in the car that long unless I'm on a trip.  That's crazy????  Not happy.
2	Not compatible with iOS 7.0.4.  Supposedly this unit (which I otherwise like) is compatible with the iPhone 5S.  However the firmware isn't compatible with the latest version of Apple's software.Also their customer service leaves a lot to be desired.Returning it.
2	In the process of returning apparently received a defective unit that would not pair with my car or any of my bluetooth enabled phones.
2	UPDATE: April '12: mine stopped charging the phone all together which is a real bummer since I depended on for long car trips. Before that it was a total must have for me.I love my iphone but don't always love the AT&T; service which is shoddy and often drops calls. Effortless to set up with very good directions and already I've had less dropped calls and more bars when I'm traveling. This is going to be the perfect solution when it works with the model car you have its definitely a 5 star product in that respect. I struggled with the star rating because though it's not the right setup in my car it would greatly help those who have a crappy signal.The 3 stars is strictly because I have a Jeep 4 door Wrangler. 2 big reasons for the star downgrade:- The 3 mounting options(2 sticky ones and a vent mount) are limited and don't work in my jeep. The vent mount does not work with my vents which are very wide and long so the clip doesn't extend enough to grip it in the back. Also I don't have any dash part near me to affix the glue sticky mounts. The only real place to put it makes it awkward to access my iphone. Plus I don't like the idea of permanently affixing anything to my car especially since it becomes a gooey mess in the summer. So this sat in my cup holder until I found a suction mount online that works with the back of the cradle so now I have a pretty sweet setup. If you're interesting in getting one leave me a comment and I'll send the link of the one I'm using.- The antenna to boost the signal is made to magnetically mount to the top of your car. That's great...if the top of your car is metal. My jeep hardtop is fiberglass and the soft top is fabric. So I had to figure out a solution. Thankfully the wire that leads from the cradle to the antenna is really long. So I was able to snake it all the way to the rear and I mounted the antenna underneath the tire on the back. Not perfect but it's still boosting the signal and working as if it were on the top. Its hidden for the most part as well by the tire so hopefully I won't have any strangers fiddling with it.Otherwise the mount easily fits my iphone 3GS with my cover on it. It charges it and holds it snugly. The power jack has a great on and off switch so you don't necessarily need to unplug it when not in use. Just push the button and you're set.All in all really a nice product and a great buy if you have the right vehicle.
2	I have followed the directions as given and my iPhone reception is reasonable. Has it improved with the use of this device? I cannot really claim to have seen a difference. I still get an occasional dropped call or show minimal reception bars even when the phone is in the cradle. I have used my phone both with and without the device and while not observing _strict_ scientific method I am not sure that I notice a difference either way.My test was performed in the car on the I-5 between Sacramento CA and Los Angeles CA at points as desolate as points running through Arizona or New Mexico.The good things I like about the booster are all of the ergonomic form factors - fits my phone even in the case charges the phone while cradled. On the flip side - I cannot connect my phone to my car stereo via the USB port and have to use the Aux input which limits my ability to control the phone via the stereo yet another thing to plug into my single car electrical outlet (leaves me wondering where to plug in my GPS).Ultimately it seems my cell reception varies with and without the device and my benefit from using this signal booster is questionable enough so that I would not recommend that anyone spend the $200+ unless they are in dire need of a signal booster. P-)
2	When the opportunity arose to review this product I jumped at it.  My husband and I are both iPhone users and while I generally don't have many issues with not being able to get a signal [unless I'm in a store] he encounters several dead zones on his way to and from work.  The dead zones are an annoyance when we're talking during his commute home but that annoyance becomes a bigger problem when it means dropped calls in the middle of on the go conference calls.  I figured it was worth a shot to see if the iBooster could really increase his cell phone signal.To test out this device my husband set it up and then called and talked to me when he got to the areas near where his phone always loses it signal.  The end result was the device worked as advertised.  In two out of the three dead zones the signal held up well at full strength (5 bars) with no digitized sounds.  In the third dead zone the phone showed a solid connection but my voice came through digitized and unclear.My husband had a few complaints about the practicality of this device.  His first issue was with the design of the device.  It creates interference with voice activated dialing since the microphone is at the bottom of the phone and is obstructed by the housing of the iBooster.  He had to hold the device and phone up to his face and yell at it in order to get the voice activated dialing to work.  He took issue with the claim that the iBooster is compatible with most iPhone cases.  He has a very slim case and he had to remove the case to mount the phone in the iBooster.  He found this annoying.  His next complaint is that the iBooster will only charge your phone and boost the signal.  That's great if all you do is talk on your iPhone but for those of us who use our iPhones to listen to music or podcasts in the car the iBooster has very limited use.  He felt the iBooster would be awesome if it had an FM tuner.  The single mode of operation make this product seem illogical for the average user given the price.  He also noted that the back of the iBooster gets very hot.The bottom line is this product does what's it's supposed to do but it has some quirks.  This device would make the most sense for someone who spends a lot of time in their car while conducting business on their phone.
0	Both my husband & I are using AT&T; - I'm on an iPhone he is not. He has resisted getting an iPhone because until he & I met a couple of years ago he only experienced dropped calls very rarely. Whenever we are speaking or if I am speaking to anyone else on my iPhone I lose the signal 3 times minimum and have to re-dial. This is a notorious problem with the iPhone that has only experienced minor improvement after some software updates.I frequently lose signal strength in some areas in the greater DFW metroplex. I was anxious to try out this kit that could make my phone more accessible (ie not flopping around in the passenger seat or next to the emergency brake) and reduced dropped calls.There was an adhesive mount and A/C vent mount included. I have learned from experience never to put adhesive on my dash. I live in Texas and when the sun comes out in the summer volcanos send sympathy cards to the asphalt! Any adhesive will turn runny sticky and unable to hold onto anything with more weight than a postage stamp when your car sits out in the hot Texas sun. I've always been strongly mechanically inclined and had to fiddle with the A/C vent mount for 45 minutes before I finally threw my hands up in the air with modest defeat. I decided it was ok for it to hang from one side and bounce around - if only I could get better signal strength.In fairness I have a new VW Beetle... they are known for their large sloping dashes steep angled windshields etc. There may be no good way to mount this in a Beetle with a 'universal' kit.Sliding the phone in the cradle and getting it to properly mount on the 30 pin connector is not a one-handed procedure. I had to take the mount off the A/C vent and pull on the plastic in the front to get my iPhone 3GS to finally properly seat onto that connector. That was about as frustrating as trying to get the cradle onto the vent then trying to remove it.I watched the video followed the instructions step by step and mounted the magnetic antenna. I was disappointed to see that the antenna that came with the kit was wired so that no matter how you mounted the antenna there was access to a cable that someone could vandalize. When you live in a city like Dallas people cut such cords just for fun. I ran the lengthy (nice length for routing along door/floor trim) cable under my seat and up the side of the interior of the Beetle and ran the cord out the top of the hatch back where the rubber trim protected the cord from being crimped. The small antenna has a strong magnet - strong enough to keep that thing mounted even in strong winds. I sometimes go to the mall or shopping and will put a jacket on top of things I don't want people getting tempted by. A cunning thief need only tug on the antenna if they notice the cord to pull the cradle along the car interior to move the jacket out of the way to see what is underneath. No they won't be able to just pull the whole kit-n-kaboodle out of the car without breaking some glass but it is something to think about. The kit provides a list of available antennas including a glass mount which would avoid such problems that can be acquired for the kit. It' s shame that a glass mount antenna was not included from the get-go.After going through all of this frustration I drove around and made some calls. In areas where I know I typically get less than 5 bars I saw no improvement. I'd unseat the phone and pop it into the cradle - the familiar charging beep could be heard and the battery symbol showed a lightning bolt through it - it was seated - antenna was securely attached cable was not crimped - and no improvement. Not only was there no improvement two people I called said that there was an echo when I talked. The minute I'd pull the phone out of the cradle the echo would go away. I was using the Apple-provided earbuds not the speaker phone.During the demo video the viewer can clearly see an improvement in signal strength. I saw no such improvement. This could have to do with the car and the area in which I live but I know I was underwhelmed either way and frustrated with the difficulty in getting my iPhone in the cradle (this is without a case on the phone of course) and trying to mount the cradle in my car.
2	While this product does deliver on its promise to boost the signal somewhat it does not guarantee that you will have fewer dropped calls on the AT&T; network.  AT&T; is overloaded with iPhones and other 3g devices and thus we are facing an overwhelmed network...which is why we drop calls.  A better signal you will get with this product..but it will not help you with dropping calls.  How can I confirm this?Number one - I have an iPhone 3GSNumber two - I have a Blackberry Bold 9700Both 3G devices.The signal strength around my home is a bit on the weak side and thus this product does improve reception...but the amount of calls I drop remains the same after multiple weeks of testing.I am giving it 3 stars due to the increase in strength but it does not help you avoid call drops.Hope this helps
2	This battery arrived on time and works OK but is slightly thicker than the original and it is hard to get the back cover back on.It lasts as long as the original did (when new) and otherwise works fine. The blue door DID NOT fit my phone luckily I did not need it anyway.All in all a decent buy for the money!
0	I put this new battery in a cellphone and it was a waste of money. Cellphone dies every day because battery is low. Don't bother buying this.
2	Well definitely this is one of the slimmest silicone iPhone covers I've ever seen. And despite of that it does provide OK protection (I've drop it a couple of times now with no impact on chassis). However I kept wondering if the sellers have two models a quality one and a sloppy one because many reviewers have praise the quality of this skin case. Unfortunately mine is definitely sloppy. The cut outs are not even they don't fit correctly at the camera side nor the silencing lever. For me the worst part is that since it fails to provide a firm grab it moves around to much to the point that I'm always pushing out the screen protector (which comes with the skin case and is in fact pretty good) from the edges of the phone .Honestly I was expecting a little more even despite the price.
0	Don't waste your time. This item came ripped when it arrived and never fit my old iphone. Keep looking for something else!
2	useful. came on time. worked well enough to cover your phone. lasted for a fairly long time. it is good
2	I love the slip on jelly type cell phone cases but the color was not accurate to the picture and it would not stay on my phone at all.  If I even picked it up the cover would just slide right off.  :(  At least it was super cheap though so I didn't waste a lot of money on it.
2	The case does not fit my phone well.  It is loose and tends to fall off.  It is an okay product but not for my I phone.
0	I wanted something sturdier to protect my iphone.  I thought this was very flimsy and not at all sturdy enough for protection.  I would not recommend this case.
2	Nope to floppy! And u sent three i only ordered one. Thanks anyway!! Happy sales to you all. Pink black
2	The case is fine and its cheap but the better question is why do you still have an iPhone 3?
2	this is a great case i just dont use it that much because it doesnt really protect my phone from being damage
2	I checked to make sure I ordered the correct iPhone case before ordering just to make sure since I ordered it expedited mail which in reality cost more than the item itself. My iPhone case broke and I can't afford to replace a cell phone so I needed a case immediately. This case is slippery when you put it in. It covers up the volume buttons although it does have little bumps where the volume buttons are but they are slippery. The cover also partially covers up the camera lense. It is impossible to take a photograph with the case on. Truly this item is total garbage. I should have spent the extra money for the Otterbox. Mine last for over a year and held up to everything!
2	This is just an ok  product. The material is fine but the fit is a little off. Tried it on an iphone 3gs and it is a little loose. It stays on and everything but will come off if faced with any resistance like a pocket. Also it arrived a day after the estimated delivery date yet only came from wisconsin (I live in Illinois).I would not purchase this again due to so many alternative options out there.
2	Fits good at first.  But is starting to get a little stretched out on the sides and at bottom where charger goes in.
2	This cover started off ok but after some use it started to get rubbery. When I would have my hair down it would get caught in the case and pull on my hair when I would move the phone away from my face. It would also get lint and other purse things stuck. Not a good case.
2	This is a simple soft silicone case that surrounds the iPhone 3gs but has no solid protection.  It is okay and is fine if that is what you are looking for.
0	this product was terrible it was cut up smelled bad did not fit phone like promised. i would not recommend for people to purchase. get an otterbox yeah they can range from 15-50$ on amazon but they protect your phone greatly and otterboxes are the best cases around.
0	They are cheap and also cheap made it is better idea spend more money to get better product i would say
0	I didn't like this product at all. It feels super cheap and didn't provide any drop protection. There are better cases in the same price range.
2	This phone case is decent quality for the price I do feel it protects my phone when I drop it. The problem is that it stretches out when pulling in and out of pockets as well as turning the pocket inside out (classy look). It also traps all the lint and dust something to know in advance. The wood design is pretty but once it stretches out my phone slides right out and its purpose is then null. But it's cheap enough that you can easily buy another one or two at once.
2	The color is bright.  The fit is good.  Just not quite as sturdy as I would have liked.  Good buy for the money.
0	It was nice in color and thats about it. The texture/ material of it made it so rough to slip into your jean pockets. It just kinda slipped around on your phone It also collected so much lint or other materials... I wouldnt get this if i was you
2	It does it's job and you get what you paid for. I liked these cases for my 3GS but i wouldn't buy it for a 4 if they even sell them for it.
0	It's in perfect condition but slides off my phone when I'm using it in any way. It's not for the Apple IPhone 3GS.
2	soft rubber and loose fit. rubs against my pocket fabric and it is never easy to take out. good protection tho. good price.
2	Due to the poor sound quality I threw this cheapie in my laptop bag as a backup. I bought aPlantronics M20 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Graphite/Blackfor daily use. It has much better sound quality plus I like the sliding on-off switch.
2	I really wanted to like this charging station but it turned out to be a huge pain in the butt all the time.  First I had to buy so many accessories (mini surge protector 2-in-1 USB cords) that it ended up being much more expensive than I anticipated.  Then whenever I needed to adjust the cords for a new device or to move a device in the grass I had to open it up -- HUGE TIME SUCK.  Finally the two top layers are quick flimsy...I bought an iDapt i4 Charger as a replacement -- I wanted something sleek and modern looking -- and have been thrilled with its performance and ease.
2	Before I say anything else: Yes it is true this is a just a plastic box with plastic grass.We were in need of some type of charging station/cable organizer. All other options we explored were either eyesores or were very cumbersome. While its true this comes with no cables it is an easy way to organize and hide your existing adapters while looking rather unique and stylish.Thankfully I purchased this on sale. I don't think I would've paid $20+ for this.
2	I had been considering buying this since I saw it on ThinkGeek.  I love the look and concept its elegant and simple.  Then I realized there was no plug included.  Paying 25 dollars for a white box with artificial grass is a bad buy.  Supply the user with a built in 3-5 ac or usb hub at the bottom and I would happily spend double the asking price.  Why buy something that will only work if you purchase another... seems backward.
2	Its a little big for my plantronics m-50 & the zipper keeps colapsing when zipping/unzipping. The case itself is durable im just not happy with the zipper design.
2	I like this product because it is small and fits in my purse nicely.  My one complaint is that even though it has a hard shell which protects my bluetooth from damage it can be squeezed and sometimes my bluetooth gets turned on while in it.  It can be annoying but it's not too big a deal.  Overall I would say this product is mildly flawed but acceptable.
2	I have a &#34;Jabra Wave Corded 3.5mm Headset&#34; that I wanted to put in this Pouch but this Pouch is too small!!If the pouch were 40% bigger it would be a great product!!
0	I received this and it worked probably the first 4 times and then the zipper broke. I would use the zipper only twice a day and I was very disappointed that it broke so quickly. I guess you get what you pay for it was  enexpensive and so was the material as well.
0	This is way too big to carry in a pocket (unless it's a big jacket pocket. I needed a place to put my bluetooth that would protect it and I could keep it in my pocket so I wouldn't lose my 3rd (or is it 4th) bluetooth headset. This will be useful to somebody with a large purse that they keep losing their headset in - you'll find this puppy!So I'm still looking for something to keep my bluetooth headset in when I'm not using it but want it with me for quick access.
2	Smaller then the photos make it out to be. My charger did not fit in the case. Although my Bluetooth did fit fine. The case was a little big for only a BT but too small to also place charger int he case. Which defeats my needs (travel needs) for the case.
2	The seller did a wonderful job getting the product to me in a timely manner and I love the pouch but the zipper broke pretty quickly. I still use it just zip it up halfway to hold the bluetooth and earbud but the wire to the earbud hands out of it. I love purple so I love the look of it.The seller is excellent and would definitely use this seller again.
0	Sadly. though the description says the Plantronics Voyager Pro headset fits in this case - it does not. Not even close. I unfortunately discarded the packaging so I cannot return the three I purchased. My fault. Also the zipper closure is very tight to the point of being almost impossible to open and close. Lesson learned - order 1 check for fit keep the packaging and return it if it does not fit because the description was wrong.
0	My cousin got this phone and has had 2 replacements and has never had it wet or even abused the phone any. It had the screen going out turning rainbowish colors. Her second phone seems to be working but neither of us seem to think it is an impressive phone
2	Already the touch screen is going out. I don't know why I even tried to go back to this phone. Its simple and the slide out keyboard is nice but overall it just stinks.
2	The price is great. You get three screen protectors. But for some reason when you place the screen protector on your phone it creates air bubbles which is very hard to remove. I tried many ways to remove the air bubbles but the air bubbles won't go away. That gives the screen a bad look. The product is made of very thin material so its almost not noticeable which is the good thing about this screen protector. If only the air bubbles would not have been created this would have been a good product. But then again it could be because of my phone and may not happen to other phones.In summary great product if you can avoid the air bubbles.
2	Con: 1-Very hard to install without bubles.  2-Size does not fit perfectly. 3-Scratched right on the first day of used! Reusable is a mislead statement.Pro: NoneUpdate: OEM shop has refunded my money so I give this product one more stars.  As OEM shop I willing to give it 5 stars for quick action to correct the problem.  Hopefully Accessory Export would make its product more quality.
2	Read the instructions very carefully and approach the installation like brain surgery. Lint and bubbles are major threats to a clear picture and it is very difficult to avoid them. If they had included five sets of screen protectorrather than twoI might have gotten one good one. Neither of my installations was clean enough to avoid being peeled off and thrown into the trash.
2	I ordered two of these for gifts; one for my son. The package is really small--which is fine for ear buds but it looked bigger in the photo. The ear buds are bright colorful and whimsical but....they won't stay in the ear. The bigger M & M part makes it hard to keep the device in--this needs some work.
0	They are very cheap.  They were for small childred and they didn't cost that much.  Wasn't long before they were broken.
2	i bought pretty much..while ...it was even hard to the assemble them...i wont buy it any more....cheap as its price
2	My son used these and thought they were great. After about 2 months of light use they just sort of fell apart. They could not be used or glued back together. He was very sad and I am unwilling to replace them because of the poor quality.
2	Cute set of headphones. Didnt last long though. Color started fading and the protection over the earbuds kept falling off. After a couple of days one side went out and I was only able to hear from one side. Then the one side that was working started sounding stuffy. Purchase at your own risk
0	Earphones with an M&M;'s theme are kind of a cute idea.  If you are looking for some economic earphones for young children who are more concerned with appearance rather than sound quality you might consider them.If you want a decent sound however save your money and look elsewhere.  The sound quality is muddy with a heavy bias on the low end.  High frequencies are not reproduced well and for regular music it can even be hard to make out some vocals.  In addition the build quality appears to be on the cheap side in some areas.  The cord is very thin and probably more prone to breakage.Perhaps these earphones are intended for small children as out of the package they come with tiny silicone earbuds attached that are too small for most adults to wear.  Larger sized earbuds are included (loose inside package so don't lose them).  To install the larger earbud you first need to remove the tiny one (don't tear it!).  There is a technique to attaching the larger earbud.  Turn it inside out and attach it to the stem with the speaker then push the edges down to get it back to the proper shape.  With the large sized earbuds installed you can get a snug fit but probably not one that cuts out too much of the ambient sound.These phones may look cool to some but that's about the only positive.  They do not reproduce sound well and may not last for very long.  The fit is comfortable but if the earbuds get torn you will probably need to buy new earphones as a spare set of earbuds is not provided.If you are looking for earphones in the same price range that sound better do a better job of cutting out ambient sound are available in a variety of colors and have a spare set of earpads take a look at JVC's Marshmallow series.
2	It help open my case but one problem looks used and the picture says ill receive 2 clip openers and I only received only 1 was up with that and one for $2.99 and used not cool ill never gonna buy from this product ill just use my nails :/
2	Item was as described and the plastic is reasonably hard but the plastic is not strong enough to do what I needed it for.  I needed to open an iPod touch.  It may work in other situations but not what I bought it for.  The product is not defective it is just not up to the task that I had envisioned it for.I would suggest you get the iSesamo metal case opener (which I also bought) which works a lot better.  The metal does not bend as much as I thought it would even thought the blade is thin.
2	I paid the price of this item thinking that i would receive three of this itemit turned out that the price is justfor one unit.i like this item because it's very hard for me to open hard cover with the hands so thisitem make it easy to open it.the cons of this item is that each side of it get damage every time you opena hard coveri would say each side can only be used twice.every time you open a hard coverthe sideyou used to open it get damege.you know what i mean?.so for the price it has they must give you two or three of them.
2	Nice non marring tool. This tool is somewhat thick for the initial opening of a tablet or cell phone. It is nice to use once you have the device cracked open to run around the edges and separate the case adhesive. It is very comfortable to hold and use. It is thicker and larger than a guitar pick. I'm going to my local music store to buy a coupe of heavy grade guitar picks to try out as guitar picks come in a variety of grades and shapes.This tool is also soft so don't expect it to last a long time. It works as intended for a fair price.
2	While these are nice to have you will find that most of the time you order a replacement screen these things come included.
2	It somewhat does the job. I just really wished the cases weren't so hard to get off in the first place but I understand why they need to be or are. It does what it is supposed to do. I only received one though. The picture shows two.
0	This battery was not the same as the original equipment; it did work with the phone which was a great choice for my mother.
0	I bought this for my phone and it didn't even work. I was not happy about it at all. One of those moments where you wish you would have just put in the extra money the first time.
2	Upon close inspection I there was a multitude of scratch marks on it. Obviously it has been used a lot before I got it. It charges up to about 90% and holds there. So it is a workable backup. The drain on the battery seems to be ok on my first run through. Can't complain too much for 5 bucks but I just wish they would advertise that they are not new.
2	It is my second cover ( for another i-phone). The first one is a year old and still in good condition. The new cover is just two months old but already got cracks.
2	this cell phone case it's ok but it mayed of of plastic so when you get it make sure the ergde's don't break off are you will have to but another one.i had 4 of them that broke on me and would not stay on and all.
0	I purchased this as my first bluetooth headset because I thought it was cute.  Bad idea.  It has very poor patchy sound quality and those that I speak to say it is echoey and hard to hear.  I have smaller ears and this is very uncomfortable to wear.  I am returning this for a different headset.
2	I had one of these earpieces years ago but it was the gold and black one and it was by far the best earpiece I ever has I could lay my phone down in my garage and still hear the person I was talking to clear as I washed my car so I thought this one would be the same but the nice silver color. I was wrong! this earpiece is not clear at all and I have to hold the phone up close to my face to avoid the static. As far as the people who shipped it to me they get 5 stars but I dont even use this earpiece i went to best buy and purchased a different earpiece for 20 bucks im completly satisfied with.
2	I had this earpiece.  Liked it for the few months (4?) I had it.  Picked it up one day and the whole thing fell apart.  I suddenly had 6 pieces in my hand.  Irreparable.  I'm not rough with my bluetooths; shocked when this happened.  Very poor workmanship very cheap materials.DON'T BUY THIS!!!As others have said -- and I agree -- it has no longevity.  The only positive about this earpiece is that it's pretty.
2	I was very disappointed as I opened the package for this product.  There is very limited protection as the sides are completely open.  If you are looking for just protecting your screen then this will work.  It will not stop anything from finding its way into the open sides.There is a very easy to use attachment screw that fastens into the tripod port on the bottom of the camera.  Once attached you simply wrap the camera with the material and a velcro patch holds it in place.I have a small camera (FujiFilm EXR) and this wrap barely fits this camera.  The velcro has very little to attach itself to and if I do not stretch the material and wrap it extremely tight then the velcro detaches.  Once when this happened my camera fell out of my hands and onto the desk - if I was standing the camera might have fallen to the floor.  There is no room to hold anything else in this wrap - this is not a substitute for a camera case to hold extra batteries memory cards or the charger.  The product description says that this product lends itself to easy removal of the battery and memory cards.  On my camera this is not true:  I would have to remove the entire wrap to get into the battery/memory card compartment.I take pictures everywhere I go and this product just gets in the way.  I generally carry the camera in my pants pocket and this would just add bulk.  I would still have to keep a small case handy for the other above mentioned accessories.I guess I'm the minority so far but I just don't see that this accomplishes anything and it adds a level of complication.
2	Maybe this product just isn't for me. As long as the lens is protected I'd rather let my camera get scratched up then deal with this thing hanging off of it. The D-Wrap screws into the tripod case on your camera and is sized for small point-and-shoot models. The attachment screw slides on a rail and the material is elastic so it should fit any camera of this class. It adds minimal bulk but doesn't protect the sides.The problem is what happens when you unwrap the case. Now you've got this foot long thing dangling from the bottom of your camara. It really gets in the way - especially if you turn the camera for a portrait shot.In practice I found this too inconvenient to use. I'd rather have a case that fully protects it for travel and I'll put the camera in my pocket or a bag for ease of use during a day of sightseeing.
2	When I saw that Vine was offering Lowepro D-Wrap I jumped on it because I own several point-and-shoot cameras.  This camera wrap asserts that it fits (or stretches to fit) most cameras.  Unfortunately that does not include my Canon A630 PowerShot.While the wrap stretches it would require three strong men to stretch it around my Canon.  So even though it screwed into the tripod mount as advertised it would mean more effort to get it into place than I could give it.Giving up on my Canon I tried it on my Flip video camera.  Yes it folds over and protects it nicely unless that is you screw it into the tripod mount.  At that point it become impossible to stretch it over the entire camera because at that point the camera is vertical and too tall to fit.Finally I tried it on my mother's Kodak SureShot.  Voila! It fits (with a moderate amount of stretching).  It's open at the ends so the camera is still subject to foreign objects entering from the side but it does protect the lens and viewing screen from dust and other undesirables while the camera is in purse or pocket.By the way if you carry your camera in your pocket you'll probably want to have a large pocket because the neoprene does not slide around easily in a close space and will not slip down into a tight jeans pocket.So would I recommend this camera glove?  It depends.  It depends on the size of your point-and-shoot camera.  It depends on how often you use your camera and whether you've already got camera protection. Those who already have a case they use will probably not benefit from this D-wrap.
0	If I knew I could make the same basic thing by cutting a piece of cardbard to size I would have saved the order hassle. This is such a flimsy item I can't believe all the positive reviews. My wife thought it was trash and threw it away when I left it on the counter. It doesn't adjust at all and did not securely hold my droid. I purchased this to take family self portraits but it didn't hold it at the proper angle. Not comfortable risking my droid's safety by placing it in this thing. I cetainly wouldn't try to interact with the droid's screen while in this holder.
0	I didn't like this product. It wasn't very sturdy and I ended up sending it right back. Don't waste your money on this one.
0	A piece of plastic with a crease in the center so it quasi folds. Silicon feet'? Silicon scraps pushed on the so called feet. Sure they don't slip but as soon as you put any pressure on the iPod the thing collapses. Junk. Pure marketing junk. Nothing but a load of bollocks. If it were metal it would be something but this is easily made from a piece of packaging plastic I wish I had known how flimsy it would be. There's more effort spent on the company branding than on the materials. Never again.
2	I bought this recently so that I could have my phone sitting upright on my desk at work. I suppose I anticipated something completely different since I am a little disappointed with the product.  From the item pictures it looked like the product would be more rigid - it is not.  It is made of a very flexible plastic molding.  Although it does hold up my phone (HTC Inspire) you have to (at least *I* had to) fidget with it for a bit and get it to actually hold the phone.Overall I suppose it does do what it says.  However if I would have been able to *play* with this product in person at a store I would NOT have purchased it.  I would have saved $8...
2	Clever gadget but no extra room in the notch that holds the iPhone to deal with a rubber cover around the edge.When the iPhone is in the vertical position the data/power cord will not fit neatly into the phone.
2	Not worth the cost. works well keeps things charged but the car charger gets too hot at times and I am afraid will damage my phone.
2	Everything worked good but the wall charger. Seem like it had a shortage in it when I needed to use it. Had to move the wire a certain way to get the wall charger to work. Everything else worked fine though.
2	Very lightweight comfortable & durable with good battery life.I bought the Plantronics Voyager Pro Bluetooth for battery life and clarity.My (3 different models) of Motorola bluetooth devises discharge within 1 hr and many times needed to change over to my phone to have a conversation.I wanted good wind resistance I was disappointed it did not work in abrisk wind unless I cupped my hand over the microphone.3 out of 10 times it got voice commands wrong.The fit using the small size ear cover does not stay in place in my large ear.I need to reposition it 4 times during a days use.I'm not satisfied with the wind resistance and voice commands.I spoke clear & in a moderate voice. It did not work 3 out of 10 times.I am a Realtor I depend on using a bluetooth devise in my business.
2	I recently purchased this product from amazon for its noise-canceling audioIQ technology. I wanted to use it mainly for in the car and on my moped. However upon using it I was greatly disappointed! The bluetooth is very cheaply made I cannot understand what I am paying $70 for! I tested it several times after the recommended full charge and several problems occurred: the max volume and the clarity of the call.I had to turn up the volume to compensate for the poor clarity of the call. Instead of crisp audio what I heard several times on end was an echo-like quality of sound. It was very difficult to hear my girlfriend when I was standing outside the car in the parking lot. Another instance (while driving) I had to turn the air conditioning practically off so that I could hear my contact speaking to me. The max volume is also very limited it had difficulty when walking by a busy park and the volume was just not loud enough. It was ridiculous! Though I asked many times how well she could here me through the line and she said very well. She didn't even know that I was using a bluetooth- in fact she was wondering why my voice sounded so much clearer than it usually does when I call her. So kudos to the voice capturing system (AudioIQ).Second issue was the clarity of the incoming signal. The next contact I called was a mile away from me both with Verizon and both with the same reception bars (3 out of 4). However I could hardly hear the nuances in his voice. Not at all what I expected after reading the reviews of this product! The voices (all of my contacts) had an echoing tone and was distracting and I had to spend most of my time trying to figure out what they said than proceeding with my part of the conversation.I would also like to mention that the controls to the ProVoyager were pretty poorly designed. The buttons have to be pressed fairly hard changing the desired position of the earpiece. A minor annoyance but after a while an unbearable process. And the voice command button (along the base of the boom) is a bit tricky to use. When pressed it pushes into my ear (fairly uncomfortable) and again repositions the device on my ear.So I will be returning it for the Plantronics Voyager which costs $40 and is a lot more reliable. Thanks for reading. Good luck!
2	This bluetooth headset functioned well enough but I found it very uncomforable and bulky. Too much of a pain to use!
2	It's a great BT headset for your cell phone (paired mine with my Nokia 5800 phone in a jiffy!). Very ergonomic and light weight! Sound reception battery life are off the charts! ... but it's NOT the main reason I bought it! Short story: I've been using Sony Ericsson BT set on Win XP PC with Skype. Never had ANY problems of any kind at all!!! Plantronics Voyager PRO ain't that friendly with PC's!? Most advanced BT headset on the market can NOT be paired with Skype on Vista? WTH??? Decide for yourself guys! They say it pairs easily with Mac (never tried that!). Read the specs!
2	This product:* was comfortable* functioned as advertised* had good battery life* was loud enough* had good outgoing sound (based on comments of those who called)* was FRAGILE--the stem between the battery compartment and earpiece brokeThe poor durability is my biggest concern.  If it only lasts a few months it's a poor value at more than $80.
2	This head piece was too bulky for my liking. However the sound quality was outstanding!
0	At my office for years I have used thePlantronics CS70/HL10 DECT 6.0 Bundle Wireless Headset System with Lifterand love it.  It fits perfectly is full of volume and microphone adjustments and I don't notice it is on me.I have also used thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging] as my primary headset with my previous Motorola RAZR and loved it.  However when I switched to the iPhone 3GS people couldn't hear me well anymore.Upon first using the Voyager Pro the other person sounded more digitized than the 510.  Also my biggest problem with this headset -- the other person sounds quiet tinny and distant.  I tried the various earpieces with and without the felt cover but it was all the same.  In comparing the 510 with this model the 510's earpiece goes much deeper into the ear canal getting the speaker deeper in creating a better sound and sealing out other sounds.  Even when pushing in the Voyager Pro the earpiece collapses instead of going deeper in.I had these hearing issues with the volume all the way up with the windows up in the car.  If I had the windows down it would be impossible to hear.I wasn't impressed with the controls of the Voyager Pro compared with the 510 either.  The power button is difficult to find and push compared to the 510.  The volume button are difficult to distinguish from one another.  On the 510 each has a different slope making it easy to know which is which.  The answer/hang up/voice dial button forces you to smash the whole headset into your ear canal to activate and it is difficult to know whether you are pressing it.  On the 510 you could hear the button being pushed or let off and you could easily counteract the force with your thumb behind keeping the earpiece from crushing your ear.This is just not usable for me I will be returning it.  Now back to the drawing board.
2	It works well enough for a consumer grade audio device which means it's about as good as the rest of them which means it's really not all that great.To claim that it can block 80dB of background noise is ridiculous. Do they mean it has an 80dB signal to noise ratio? It doesn't. I doubt it is 10dB. The first thing I did with it was call my wife who was sitting next to me. She answered on speaker-phone so I could hear the call quality and we had a laugh about the long duration echo she heard on her phone. So that means it was clearly picking up her phone which certainly wasn't my mouth so it is very sensitive to outside sound.Having use aviation and military headsets which have proper noise cancelling microphones I can only describe the claims for this device as laughable.But compared to other crummy consumer headsets it is at least clear for the person you are calling.With 600 other reviews of this product nobody is ever going to read this but if anyone does at least you won't have unreasonable expectations.
2	Uncomfortable and noise cancelling is much better with other brands. I use headsets to communicate while driving often at interstate speeds and this headset is difficult to hear and for my customers to hear me on. It is also very bulky behind my ear and with glasses on gets quite uncomfortable quickly.Also the small rubber-like connector section between the main battery and electronics section (behind the ear) and the boom is very prone to breaking. Two of these broke in less than a year for me. Just a less than perfect engineering design IMHO.Finally if you have any face hair or stubble it will probably get caught in the mic screen and/or cause scratching noises in your listener's ear.
2	I bought this headset based on the excellent product reviews plus my own experience with the Plantronics over the head wireless headsets we use in the office.Positives:+ The Plantronics Voyager is very easy to set up and pair with a bluetooth phone.+ The people I talk to report that the sound quality on the other end is very clear.+ Excellent battery life.+ Reversible feature is very clever -- the headset can be worn on either side.+ The headset is lightweight and surprisingly comfortable.Negatives:- For me the headset does not fit well which has a significant impact on sound volume on my end.  Given the angle at which the earpiece is attached to the electronics/battery compartment the earpiece won't stay firmly seated in my ear which makes it hard to hear even at the highest volume.  I have to use my free hand to keep the earpiece pushed firmly into my ear canal which defeats the purpose of a hands-free headset.- The controls are very tiny and hard to manipulate without looking.  Specifically the position of the volume controls on top of the unit makes them hard to use while driving.- The primary control (for taking calls hanging up etc.) is on the outside surface of the earbud.  Given the problems I have keeping the earpiece firmly seated in my ear I often have to push the device more firmly into my ear; and given the position of the off switch it means that I routinely inadvertently hang up on calls.In a nutshell:  If this device fits for you you can can expect the usual Plantronics quality which is excellent.  But if it doesn't fit it will be frustrating to use (after a month I stopped using mine and switched to a different hands-free solution).  Unfortunately I don't know of any way to try on the headset unless you have a friend who owns this model.
2	I previously owned a Plantronics Voyager 510.  I was so happy with it that I bought this one thinking it was a leap forward.  I was extremely disappointed.  It didn't stay connected as well as the much older 510 sound quality wasn't as good either for me or the people I spoke to with it.  It broke where it was supposed to pivit while inserting it in my ear one day.  I glued it back and got another 5 months of use before it simply quit working.  I attempted to replace the large ear insert and could not buy them with the covers.  I had to change a flat tire in the sun one day and I guess my sweat or the heat of being in my ear in the 95 degree sun killed it.  I've done a lot more with the older Voyager 510 it still works but after nearly six years the battery isn't charging well so it is time to replace.  I won't make another mistake and buy a Voyager Pro though.  I'll look for something else.
2	My biggest problem with the Bluetooth headsets is they are not loud enough.  If that is your main issue with the bluetooth headsets then this one is not for you.  Purchase the Plantronics Voyager 510 over this one.  I have them both and the Plantronics Voyager 510 is definitely louder.  I tested both with same phone (Blackberry) and set max volume levels on both phone and bluetooth..  The 510 was around 25% louder IMO.  I'm going to return this one.
2	The headset pairs fine and is comfortable enough but isn't loud enough to hear well outdoors even at top volume.
2	well i just got my voyager today and im using it its nothing special like the volume could be a little louder. also just getting it on ur ear is a hassle and it was kinda expensive but as far as static or anything else its good i just hope im using it right  well thats all for now. By the way the case u can get on the website or here on amazon.
0	This bluetooth lasted me less than a week... I have had over 15 and I was really interested in the dual speaker for clarity and pick up. not worth the price the setup is flimsy and cheap. Broke very quickly...
2	I've had this for about a week and haven't had any complaints from clients as to sound quality. That's a great plus. Now in a noisy environment i have trouble hearing them. So far I've yet to be able to get it to fit snugly. Another negative - i love to listen to any of my 3rd party Apps through my iPhone and it would never pick up. I called Plantronics Tech Support and was told i could listen to the iPod portion but no 3rd party apps -- WTH that's why i waited.I think it was a waste of money.
2	This headset does in fact have great reception and clarity.  People have remarked on how much better they can hear me since I upgraded from my old Plantronics headset and I'm able to hear them more clearly as well.  The folding mic is a nice feature and the device is easy to re-align from left to right.  Five stars for those features but...One star for fit. I really can't stand this headset for frequent use simply because the fit is TERRIBLE.  My old headset fit securely and so comfortably that I'd forget I had it on.  Not so with this one.  It regularly pops off my ear - even when I'm not moving - and is almost impossible to fit with sunglasses or computer glasses on.  If I wear it for more than a few minutes I actually get sore both on the outer and inner ear (where the earbud fits) and switching earbuds hasn't helped.  I'm actually considering going back to the old headset even with the poorer sound quality - or just switching brands.  Someone has to have a nice marriage of sound and fit but it isn't here.
0	I go through a lot of head sets and I am going through this one is going to be no different-as in I am going to send it back! This thing is so big you might as well try to tape your phone to your ear. And behind your ear at that! It is so big it feels (too me) as if someone is tugging on your ear! It is not uncomfortable but actually painful!Sound quality? Maybe I have a bad one? Static filled not loud enough and not clear. Sometimes when the phone is in my pocket it does not work clearly. That is only 3 feet away!Now the real downside....I do not have a good recommendation for you but I just ordered 5 different brands/types that I have not tried before.Someone has to make a good bluetooth headset. I will endeavor to find one.
2	Probably the best bluetooth headset I have ever tried the dual mics on the Plantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headset have such a great sound that it's hard to tell that you're on a bluetooth.The cons were that it doesn't fit me very well I had to keep adjusting it and every time I did I would hang up on a call.That said I found myself disconnecting calls readjusting too often.It's just not for me.
2	For the high price of 200.Both BrokeOne usb charge plate broke off.... won't chargethe other just fell apart the rubber its made out of won't last wires exposed brokenI bought a wired head set for 2 dollarsGiving 2 stars because plantronics replaced both headsets.
2	Seller did an excellent job and sent the headset right away. I am very pleased with the seller and the service I received. However this headset does nothing to impress me. The battery life on this blue tooth is way TOO short! I thought I was getting a better replacement for my old Motorola blue tooth that finally died after 6 years NOT!! We've owned several blue-tooth and this one is a big let down. Not only can you NOT put it on your ear and enjoy an entire day out without the thing going dead everyone I talked to said I sounded muffled at times. I drive an 18wheeler and this headset captures too much background noise. I only give this an average score. I let my teenage daughter have this one and I am looking for a better one.
2	The ear loop part is wearing apart and soon it will break into two pieces. The product itself is not bad but the size of the headset is somewhat large and this model does not have the accidental call lock button. I found myself pocket dialing when the bluetooth headset is in my pocket. Another issue i came across is the random disconnect on bluetooth connection. Sometimes i would loose the signal on my headset but my phone thinks that i am still connected to the device.Overall this is not too bad for $65. The quality is clear and loud enough to talk and listen to music while driving.
2	I had high hopes for this device but ultimately I am buying a new device b/c this one is inadequate. I'll just list the pros/cons from my experience of using this device on a daily basis for almost 4 months. I use this device with the Droid Razr Maxx.Pro:* Good wind noise reduction when outside* Pairs very easily with the devices I've tried.* Reasonable battery life - I can talk for 4 or 5 hours in a day with no problems.Cons:* Bad sound quality: I get reports from listeners of echos clipped speech and low sound volume regularly. I know it's not the cell service b/c when I switch to the device directly listeners say Ah that's much better now.* Bulky: it's fairly big as a device around the ear so wearing sunglasses and this device isn't great.* Annoying: After fully charging overnight the device will report battery medium after about an hour of use. To make it worse it actually says Battery medium in a British female voice during a call causing me to miss words of the other party. *This cannot be disabled.*UPDATE: I purchased the expensive Bose deviceBose Bluetooth headset Series 2 - Left earto replace this one and while it has a worse battery life it charges quickly and the sound quality is tremendously better. I use the bose device all the time and have finally found a bluetooth headset I can rely on.
2	Simply said I love plantronics. Have used them in the office and at home. However I'm getting tired of this series and their stablity with those of us that wear glasses. Felt ok first month or so. However now even when trying different earpads it just won't stay stable if using all day during work. I'm disappointed by the lack of stablity in my ear as i'm constantly trying to push back in the ear so it doesn't feel like it is about to flop out.Good performance mediocre stablity. I'm getting one that allows a headband next time as I just don't like these secure behind the ear only types.(have had for around 2-3 months now)
0	After a couple of months with this headset I have to give it a bad review. It does not perform well with my iPhone and often callers say my speech sounds all warbled and scratchy. Further it's uncomfortable to wear and feels heavy behind my ear. I also cannot wear my sunglasses with it.I get much better mic quality either holding my iPhone up to my ear without a headset or using the wired one that came with it.I regret my purchase of this Plantronics.
0	This has the best sound and useability but it has had to be replaced several times under warranty. My guess if one is an occasional user it is a 5 star but if one is a heavy user i.e. daily user - that is why there are so many one stars. If they would fix its failures it would be a clear winner.
2	These actually do work for the iPhone's capacitative screen which is not pressure-based.  Not just any plastic or rubber will work on those unlike the resistive touch screens which work by physical pressure.  Some cheap pens which are labeled as being iPhone compatible actually are not but this one is.However the rubber used for the tip of this stylus (possibly out of necessity due to the touch sensor type) is very sticky and not good for swiping or drawing.Also the rubber tip is actually a bubble and not solid which makes it squish down very easily.  If you hold it at 45 degrees like a pen and push down with more than a light tap the bubble can squish flat and the edge of the metal tube can hit the display.
2	These styluses are cheap enough so worth a try I received 2 and one worked better than the other on my iPhone 4 and iPad 2 though both look the same. It's a hit and miss really. If you're just tapping a smartphone you will probably be happier than if you bought it for your iPad.Smartphones have smaller screens so this stylus despite its non-responsiveness to some taps does a better job than your finger for selecting web links or playing some games. It's not too great for writing or sketching but still more precise than a finger on a smartphone screen. For an iPad you have more surface area and your finger works pretty well so you will be more frustrated when repeated taps on the glass bring no response.Once again it's a hit and miss with the quality so you may get a decent one or a bad one which is not too great. Not bad if you want to keep them in a couple different places like your car office etc. They can come in useful in the winter when you don't want to take off your gloves.
2	These devices are convenient but in just a few months of very infrequent use mine started to work only part of the time.  The wires next to the connectors becomes fatigued over time and they break internally.  If you want to find just the perfect position to hold the cable it will eventually work but who wants to hold the cable and watch their phone charge?
0	Be warned this microUSB cable cannot be used to sync WM6.5 smart phones to PC. My HTC pure won't work with this cable but it works fine with the original cable comes with the phone device. Apparently not all microUSB cables are the same.
0	I purchased this simple batery for a cell phone one would think that would be a no brainier. wrong This seller does not respond to email and I a having to go threw Amazon jut to get my money back If you are smart you will not buy from this seller
0	Very hard to operate.Hard to get synced up with the phones. Instructions do not help either. Waste of money
2	[Edit: after writing this I took out the Jawbone again reset it fully charged it and tried to see if I could get it to work as well as others are claiming. In a single day over the weekend I left it on and was only able to make it last just over one total hour of talk time before the battery died in the middle of a call. The total talk time was measured across three separate calls. This was over about 6-hours of total total use in one day whilst out and about. Same issues still with this one and the others I had. I'll try calling/returning directly to Jawbone and see what happens since it's paid for. If I could change my 'star' rating from a 2 to a 1 star during and edit I would. Who knows maybe the green one will work better.]This is probably the best looking headset available but that's really where the positive comments stop. Well not exactly it's also very light and charges very quickly to reach full charge (&lt; 1-hour).I have had three (3) Jawbone Primes and all behaved the same with one that simply stopped working after a few weeks. Why three? I bought one thinking it looked great and I loved what I had read (reviews as well as technicals on Jawbone's site). It simply was not living up to the sound quality nor battery life I expect for something in this category that I pay a premium price of $130 for. I returned it thinking something *had* to be wrong with it. The second was the same and just quit working after a few weeks. I thought OK this definitely has problems so I'll try again and get what I thought I was paying for. No go. I returned it after a month.You might be reading this thinking it's my phone or environment. I would think this too but I rotate between three distinct phones regularly (I go through phones more often than headsets). I used them on Nokia N97 G1 Android and iPhone 3GS. Also I linked to my computer for Internet calls. The environment varied from sitting at home and driving in a car to office and outside.First the earbuds were too mushy and none fit right - the phone was always slipping so I bought a set of Plantronics earbuds. This fixed that issue.Second The sound was not great. Many I spoke to complained about the sound. On my end there was nothing special regarding call sound that I couldn't get in units half the price. The noise cancellation was no better than a Nokia BH-703 or Sony (forget the model right now) that I own. Since this is their claim to fame I did test this thoroughly in various noisy environments particularly with the Nokia BH switching between the units. Wind train traffic riding in a car TV and others. It was not any better and in some cases worse. Yes I was carful to make sure I had the Jawbone properly fitted with it touching my face appropriately.Third the battery life on all three was simply poor. Unlike others my experience was that it did not live up to the 4.5 hour talk time claim. I have meetings I take on the phone frequently that are one to two hours in length. Without exception using a full charge to start each unit would last about an hour. I had one go to 93-minutes but only once. With light use and leaving on all the time I had to charge daily. This was bad to the point I found myself wondering how much battery was left all the time. This is bad user experience. Speaking of charging this is where it actually does great. Less than one hour charging on a completely dead battery and full charge is back. Unfortunately that doesn't mean much.Fourth the Noise Assassin button was problematic. All three had problems with it sticking and being pushed in so much that it lost it's raise so I had to push very hard to get it to work: not good when you don't use the strap (or even if you did for that matter). I also had a problem changing modes frequently when I was simply trying to cycle through the volumes.Fifth no dedicated power button but this I could have lived with but the light that indicates state was under my thumb making it difficult to know if on or off. I inadvertently left the Jawbone on many times when I thought I held it long enough.Sixth Jawbone documentation and web site state holding the power button for 3-4 seconds for power on/off as well as when putting in pairing mode. Try about 10-seconds and you'll be closer.Seventh I had to hard reset all three of them more than once.Eighth I just forgot what this was but it's good. Oh now I remember it's a big pain to remember the various button presses holds and combinations to get the various functionality (call answer/hangup volume noise assassin on/off voice call etc.)Ninth: I am contemplating if this is the worst aspect: the sound is terrible. A lot of static/noise that I notice and people on the other end have trouble hearing me. It's persistent regardless where I am (inside outside car etc.). Sometimes it just disconnects from the phone (bluetooth just drops). I'm pretty sure my pocket or hand are not over 33' away from it. Neither issues are apparent with other lesser expensive units.You're probably bored reading this by now. What fascinates me is the fact I went through three of these and used with many devices and always had consistently bad experience yet this does seem to get some good reviews and the unit is popular. I don't think I'd pay $60 for this but I might because of looks and lightness. However it is simply too much work problematic and poor earbuds (costing you more money) for the premium price.
2	Sound quality is very good.  My only issue and it could be an issue my personal one is battery life is not the best only an hour or so on a charge.  but it pairs easy and is comfortable
0	My original Jawbone was a wonderful headset.  Clear understandable and others could hear me clearly.  When I lost that unit I went back to Jawbone.The only model available was the Prime.  Its performance just doesn't measure up to expectations from the Original.  The Prime is fine for me to hear but the microphone is terrible.  The first unit went back under warranty because the static from the mike was so bad.  My wife used it to demonstrate to me on another phone how bad.The replacement unit (I had to pay to return the first unit) had a slightly different but similar issue.  Still no one could hear me talking and what they did hear sounded like an echo.  The Jawbone service techs were polite but said all they could do with the second issue was to refer the question to 'the front office' who have not responded in over a month.Folks in the phone stores recommended other manufacturers for BT headsets.  I should have listened.
2	Good news: it looks cool and it is light-weight.Bad news: Poor fit for my ears. The ear loop didn't improve the fit. The volume adjustment is not intuitive; I find myself reaching for the phone to turn the volume up or down.Conclusion: Jawbone being one of the more expensive bluetooth headsets in the market it simply didn't live up to its price tag.
2	Good News: Audio is above-average and pairing is rock-solid.Bad News: Three (3) Design Flaws...Design Flaw 1: ButtonsThe combination power/activation button is a major design flaw.  My device turned itself on and off (or activated my phone) over and over.This is a problem for many reasons not the least of which is battery life.As others have mentioned pressing this button (even accidentally) can end calls.  Ont eh Jawbone ICON the button was relocated to the back - a stroke of genius according to owners of both devices.The issue is that it doesn't take much pressure to activate the button.  Even if the Jawbone button is facing outward (that is not touching your leg but rather touching your pants pocket) it is enough to click the button.Others have also complained about the separate volume button (it cycles; there is no up/down rocker).Design Flaw 2: EarloopsThe second major issue (for someone like me who requires a loop) is the connection from loop to phone.  I've gone through three (3) of the leather loops and one (1) of the plastic loop displayed on/with the device on the product page.  The connector just snaps after 2-3 weeks of use.  Customer support was initially rude and arrogant (requiring me to send back the broken loop) but after I provided a photo they replaced one of the leather loops.Design Flaw 3: Removing ear rubber thingsAnd finally the third issue is the ear rubber thing.  While you should never have to replace it based on Design Flaw 2 I had to (a) remove it to get the serial number and (b) change sizes to make the Jawbone fit while I awaited a replacement earloop.  This took 30 minutes and three people before we thought we were going to rip the rubber piece in two.Aliph was in denial on these but based on their actions (releasing the Jawbone ICON with an inner power switch) the combination button is clearly not optimal.
2	I thought I would love this piece but the wrap around ear adapter broke off immediately and the stay in the ear rubber plug never stayed in my ear more that 10 minutes before popping out and it I tried to adjust it during a call it would sense my hand touching it and thing I wanted to hang up on the call. I don't even know where that thing is anymore...
2	Cheap! Cheap! This phone has the worst caller ID display I've ever seen. The handset doesn't feel right. The wall mount option is a joke. Just try to do the wall mount.
2	We had the phone for about 3 months before I threw it away. There was static on the phone from the day we got it.  people stopped calling out or answering the phone because we just couldn't hear.  not worth trying to return.
2	I was looking for some cheap phones to put in our bedrooms and living rooms.  We no longer use a landline much since our cell phones have so many minutes.  We now use the magic jack and only make occassional calls.  I was hoping this phone would be a good choice.Pros:  cheap nice lookingCons:  poorly made when pushing the phone buttons it doesn't have much sound feedback to tell you if you've pushed it the LED on the front has no light so you cannot see the numbers you are calling or the people calling you and unfortunately it takes batteries to use the caller ID (that may be standard and I didn't knock of points for that but it sucks).Of the 4 phones I ordered one was bad out of the box but that could be a fluke.  To me it's a pain making a call since you really have to pay attention when pushing the buttons.  Most other phones give you a nice loud sound when pushing the number buttons.All in all I'm sorry I went so cheap on this phone and wish I'd spent just a few dollars more and gotten something better.
2	I don't have a lot to say about this basic phone with Caller ID.For the price (11.00 delivered) I don't know if you could do better.Sound & Build quality seem fine.Comments about phone's base being lifted up & falling when you answer call is operator error.  The little plastic do-hickey that the handset spring loaded button rests on is reversible. If the hand-set is lifted with the base - slide the do-hicky off and reverse it or even try removing and the problem should be solved.
0	I had the worst experience with Elago.  They labeled the product wrong when i searched for it which led me to receiving the wrong product. I wanted a stylus for a touchscreen phone and they sent me a stylus for a palm device. The plastic stylus was not recognized by my phone so i e-mailed Elago and they informed me that they sent out the wrong model...way to go real professional Elago.  If that doesn't make matters worse they didn't offer to send me a new one...they wanted me to ship the original first. I ended up returning the original because i wanted what i paid for...i returned it through UPS and didn't get a word from them after a few days. I e-mailed them again and it seems as if they completely forgot about my situation...so when they got the e-mail they responded that they have sent it out to me. When i finally got the product i originally ordered...they sent me a stylus that does work but it has a fat rubber tip. The product i wanted had a ball point end. At this moment I just gave up...screw this company screw their products. I do not recommend...ever....ever. Please do yourself a favor and buy a product elsewhere on amazon.
0	Uh the descripton needs to read that the Elago Retractable Stylus is for some Touchscreen Wireless Phones. It does not work on the Android Touchscreens. It does not have the appropriate tip for the Android Touchscreen. And the seller wants you to walk over crushed glass in barefeet in order to return an item that does not do what they said it would do. So you end up paying for a thing and the shipping on the thing that does not work. Plus you have to make another purchase for a stylus that does work on The Android Touchscreen. Rrrggh.
2	I got this hoping that it might work with my Garmin GPS and my Android cell phones... It doesn't.For PDAs I was able to use it on an OLD old old palm pilot. I have not attempted using htis on any other personal products. If you are sensitive to germs and whatnot or hate using the stylus pens at checkout for whatever reason (mine being those damned knotted up leashed they stick 'em on. GRRR!) this is a simple replacement that fits right on your keyring without adding much mass and almost no excess weight.It is nice there is a distinct pop/click/snap when both opening and closing and when replacing the cap.
0	I bought this for my IPhone 4 and IPod touch 4th Generation. This DOES NOT work on Apple. Not worth the money at all. I feel like I got ripped off.
2	I have a Lenovo S10-3T which does not recognize the stylus on the multitouch screen. Also there is no place for the cap to be placed on the stylus so it could be easily misplaced or lost. It might be better for the iTouch or iPhone.
0	I don't like this product at all only had for about 2 weeks and it's not working anymore so don't buy this product not good at all.
0	Cell phone problems?Complete your suite of abuse with the highly rated Jawbone Prime Platinum by Aliph. Not only is it expensive but even Spock could not get it to stay in his ear. And dispite it's high price the audio qulity is not that good.With the previous model (which did not stay in you ear either) you could remove all the rubber earpices and jam it into your ear and enjoy resonable quality while driving your convertible with the top down.No more and no more. This baby is going back.This is my 5th headset in as many weeks. Before I go back to a can and a piece of string....anyone out there have anything they like?If it is not going to work very well at least have it be cheap.
0	Packaging was great. Bluetooth works so so. I can here  good however family and friends constantly tell me I fade in and out.  I still use since its all I have.  It arrived 2 days earlier than expected.  I'm in the market looking for a better blue tooth. I figure since it was a jawbone it would be great.  Volume goes up and down.  If u have small ears keep looking. No earpieces will fit comfortablyUpdate 2/3/12. after 60 days this blue no longer works i can't get my phone to read the blue tooth anymore. i have also changed to a motorola phone and it doensnt read it either. Really feel like i wasted my money and to much time has gone by to get my money back or a replacement. the hook that goes around the ear is not sturdy i should of just use my husband plantronics blue tooth
2	I've got aBlackBerry Bold as well as an iPhone 3G. I'm not writing this review exclusively for comparing the N97 side-by-side but given the price of this phone the bar is set reasonably high. Obviously nothing's really as good as a BlackBerry when it comes to e-mail (and you're using a BES) and nothing available right now is as good as an iPhone when it comes to web browsing or application availability. So for reference those weren't taken in to consideration.The N97 arrives in a very nice package with a pre-charged battery and thoughtfully written manual. The included software doesn't run on OS X so I spent very limited time working with it.Within a couple of minutes of receiving the box I threw my SIM card in and the phone was happily asking for some settings. What impressed me immediately is that the N97 seemed to know exactly how to configure itself for data and MMS services. This is the first unbranded phone I've used that didn't need me to enter the settings for my carrier (AT&T;).The N97 almost instantly showed a strong 3.5G signal and started filling the home screen with information. I placed a couple of test calls and was extremely impressed with the sound quality. Without question this is one of the best sounding wireless phones I've ever used.And then the wheels started to come off...First task: sync my work mail contacts and calendars via ActiveSync.This started out reasonably easy until I realized about halfway through the wizard that I had entered a setting incorrectly. Unfortunately once you have something in the wizard it's there. There's no Back button. So the Mail For Exchange program started complaining immediately.No problem I thought I'll just change the settings. This turned out to be far more convoluted than it should be. Options doesn't give you a path to the settings. You have to go to hit the silver button then go to Applications then go to the MfE folder (which is incredibly cryptic if you don't know what you're looking for) to change the settings.Once I had them changed the N97 happy started grabbing everything I wanted from my Exchange server. I went back in to Options and saw some well thought out options like setting prime time for a constant sync and a schedule for when you don't need instant access. There were also options for setting Out of Office notifications and the overall experience was quite good.Second task: set up my personal e-mail account.Having used the wizard already this was straightforward. The program asked if I wanted to connect to get my mail and I confirmed that I did. Mail showed up and all was good. Until I tried to leave the program. That's when I learned that the N97 is apparently incapable of maintaining two mail connections.Annoyed but willing to accept this limitation I tried to put the account on my home screen along with my Exchange account. Apparently the N97 can't do this either. You can have one mail box on the screen regardless of the number of mail accounts you may be using.Third task: connect with my Bluetooth speakerphone.My car has a Bluetooth speakerphone. Since I can remember Bluetooth being a feature on wireless phones Nokia seems to have dominated this space by including just about every Bluetooth profile under the sun. Pairing the N97 wasn't a problem. After it was set up I made a couple of calls (which again had awesome clarity) and thought everything was fine. Until...When I returned to my car later in the day I noticed that calls weren't being directed to the speakerphone. As it turns out the N97 won't re-pair with anything on its own. So while I could use the speakerphone with my Bold and iPhone without doing anything at all the N97 requires you to hit the silver button then go to Setup then Connectivity then Bluetooth then Paired Devices then pick the speakerphone then hit pair every time.Speaking of which...Fourth Task: answer the stupid phone.I'm not 100% sure this is even possible with the N97. When the phone rings you have a large bar with an arrow that points to nothing and is labeled Answer. If you tap it nothing happens. If you hit the green button nothing. If you unlock the phone and try either nothing.Feeling like a complete moron I had to look it up. It turns out the bars are sliders similar to the Unlock slider on an iPhone. Yet this is really the ONLY thing in the OS that acts like an iPhone.Fifth Task: get Facebook working.This wasn't difficult at all. Enter your name and password and go. The application looks similar to the BlackBerry version which I happened to like more than the iPhone version.It does just about everything you'd expect it to until it crashes. Yes that's right. Until it crashes. Constantly. Sometimes it does a full I'm kicking you back to the home screen crash and other times you get a red box telling you that your phone needs to be restarted. Sometimes the red box goes away on its own. There's really no rhyme or reason to it.Sixth Task: read my e-mail.Well... on the first try I had a message that said my phone was out of memory. You see despite having 32GB of storage for music and movies the amount of memory your phone can actually use for programs is quite limited. The out of memory message suggested closing other applications which I did and which resolved nothing. Rebooting the phone worked.That's when I discovered that the N97 is actually quite awful at rendering mail that isn't plain text.That's also where I started to give up on the N97. In between all of this I also discovered that:*Your choices for incoming message alerts are either at the same volume as your ringer or disabled.*Some things need to be double-tapped others single-tapped with little indication as to which is which.*The Ovi Store is basically a kludgy mess.*The keyboard will constantly register any key that you so much as brush your finger next to when typing.*There is virtually no connection between what the battery display chooses to tell you and how much battery life you actually have.*The N97 is basically a hopeless mess of a phone.Admittedly there are some bright spots:*The back camera takes surprisingly good pictures.*The included weather application is actually pretty cool since it uses GPS and updates often.*The overall build quality of the phone is quite good.And sure there are a boatload of hacks and tweaks you can make to the phone to get it to do things closer to what you want. But in my estimation the amount of research and effort to do so is unreasonable given this phone's cost.I've also heard that a new software update is imminent (as of this review the most recent version available for this phone is 12.0.24) so that may solve some problems. But with the N900 not costing substantially more and a release date any day now the N97 is for Symbian fans only.
2	So I started using this phone about 5 or 6 months ago and have recently come to this decision to ditch it for a Nokia E75. I will list the pros and the cons I think that the Nokia N97 has....pros*Nice and eye-catching design....Many friends really liked the look of the phone and the sliding keyboard really excited some people*Satisfying web browsing....It has been really nice to look at some much-visited web pages and do some shopping online with the phone most web sites load quickly and fully*Nice camera*Pretty decent music player....I used this phone with a 16GB card full of music as my primary head-phone music player most of the summer*Large screencons*widgets are a mixed bag...most of them are not really useful and would not connect consistently*lock key on side of the phone has been a real pain....sometimes it would work then not work then not unlock get stuck etc*the touchscreen is just soooo not smooth and slick. I would often wonder if I had pressed something hard enough or not hard enough.*QWERTY keyboard is not very easy to use. The character button is right next to the space button so I was CONSTANTLY calling up a page of characters at the wrong time which really slows down typing*on screen numeric key-pad is ok for T9 typing but very clumsy.... I am a very heavy texter and this got so frustrating for the amount of backspacing and deleting for most text messages*not pleasing photo gallery....the biggest problem I felt with this was just how unattractive it looks. I once had a Nokia N85 and the way it displayed the photos was very streamlined and neat looking. This device just lays them all out with no styling and also near the end of my using the device it would take so long to load that it got kind of embarrassing if I were trying to show someone a photo*general bulkiness of the device*high price tagand finally I just got tired of it turning off unexpectedly re-booting itself not being able to unlock it with the lock key etc.So as you can see it really isn't a bad phone. It just fell way short of my expectations for a Nokia flagship phone and also as a touchscreen device. I ordered the E75 out of sheer frustration and the desire to get away from a touchscreen. I've only had the E75 for a few days but in spite of the smaller screen I now have a smaller easily pocketable phone with a VERY VERY VERY nice QWERTY keyboard and a traditional keypad for T9 texting. Very happy with my new phone and kinda glad I don't have to deal with the frustration of all the N97's inconsistencies. Thanks for reading!
2	I have owned Nokia phones my whole life.  This phone is nothing more than a N95 with a touch screen and poor integration.  There are many bugs in the code right now.It has a chance to become a great phone but wait till the first software update to see how much time & effort Nokia is going to put into it right now you are best to hold off.UPDATE: I returned the phone back to Nokia Too many software inconsistencies some screens you double touch (click) others you only touch once. Some screens you have to use a scroll bar others you just drag your finger to scroll down. I don't want to have to learn which screen do what and change my habits depending on the application/menu I'm on. Nokia should have taken the time to make all their apps and menus work the same. I would understand that 3rd party applications might be different but not the installed applications on the phone.This phone really needs to be in your hands for a day or two to figure out the frustrations with it. Don't get me started on the poor use of memory and how if you are not a Nokia user from a long time ago you install your apps on the default drive only to figured out the default drive is not where all the memory is. Or if you get tons of text messages it fills up the C: drive and you-the owner- have to change system settings to tell TXT MSG'ing to not use the default drive.Search the web for N97 to read and see the YouTube videos of why not to buy this dumb phone - um I mean smart phone.
2	Hard to maintain working properly. Look for another option. there is definetely better phones of about the same or better price.
2	I am a big Nokia fan and really liked my 5800 and 5530 so I was quite looking forward to playing with the N97. This is a exquisite piece of hardware the feel of the device is the nicest of any phone I have owned. But the software is really showing its age even compared to newer cheaper Nokia phones.Nokia really are asleep at the wheel the 5530 shows they can do reasonable job of making a touch phone using S60 but they have let their S60 flagship lag far behind other S60 phones that are less than half the price. I gave both the 5800 navigation edition and the 5530 XpressMusic 5 stars based on the great usability and incredible value but the wonderful N97 hardware is let down by old software.Good:- Wonderful hardware.- Excellent call quality- Very extensive feature set.- Very nice screen in sunlight.- White color looks great.- Nice keyboard (except space bar).- 32GB internal storage.Bad:- Home screen lacks scrolling contacts of 5530.- Inconsistent touch menu (some double some single tap).- Very small space bar.- Mediocre browser.- Weak FM transmitter (not powerful enough for car use).- Ovi Maps lack search (you need to have google maps installed too).- No in-line spell check.Don't even waste your time comparing this phone to true smartphones like nexusone droid or iphone 3gs its just not in that league software wise only price wise. When you see what google and apple have done so early in the smartphone game it really is a shame for Nokia. Such great hardware let down by such bad software. And before you say N900 I had one and returned it maemo shows promise but is far from ready for primetime use and the hardware is a brick.If you have lots of money already like Nokia S60 phones and have never used an iphone or droid you should love this phone. Everyone else steer clear of it looks at the 5800 or 5530 if you wanna go Nokia.
2	I would say its a big battery it reduced the fact that the PSP is not longer slim at one end.You would think after a couple years Sony would make an extended battery thin.Sony does it with all their playstations.I bought a slim for it to be slim they no longer make regular batteries so it's all recycled now from a third party.eCity is the only one I found with a name.These extended batteries are made from Sony so I do know they last a while.
2	Overall this thing is ok. It does the job recharging the phone but it's slow. It charged my Droid X from 10% to 60% in about 4 hours. I was still using it during that time.
2	This Energizer/XPAL XP2000 power pack is nice and compact. It's about the size of a credit card and half an inch thick. It's got a glossy plastic finish and a 4-LED battery indicator so you can check how much charger it has. I love the fact that it has a standard USB output and not the horrible proprietary tip system in the XP600. It charges through a miniUSB port and has a reset button - although I'm not sure why.This device adds about 1260mAh to my Nexus 4 which isn't too bad. It outputs current at 0.5A though so don't expect it to provide 1-hour charges or anything.Good build quality decent capacity.
2	The mifi has the potential to be a breakthrough product but unfortunately it fails in its first iteration.While casual web and email users won't notice this more complicated and data intense connections (such as connecting to a VPN) seem to overwhelm the Mifi and it will drop the connection to Verizon's network and quickly reconnect.  While such behavior won't impact email or web browsing severely it does force VPN users to have to reinitiate a connection and start over.  For business users it's effectively useless.This is not a problem confined to a single location either.  So far this behavior has occurred in multiple locations across four states even when there's a full strength connection to the tower.Another annoyance is the charging behavior.  Plugging the device into a USB port on a computer disables the wifi router and converts the device back to a traditional USB broadband access device.  What were the engineers thinking?  If the battery is running low you're forced to connect the old fashioned way to the network with bloated drivers and all of the annoyances that this device is supposed to eliminate.  Activation was a pain too as it required installing all of that stuff to get started.Words cannot express how truly disappointed I am in this product.  Even more so the fact that both Verizon and Novatel are completely silent on the disconnect issue.  There's a good discussion on the Verizon messageboards that describes the problem (and many users' frustration) in greater detail.UPDATE -- 10/24/09Novatel and Verizon released a firmware update for the device in October.  I haven't used it enough to make a judgement as to whether or not this improves the situation but some users are reporting better device behavior.  I'll report back when I learn more.Unfortunately Mac users are out of luck on the firmware update.  The device will only update with the Windows version of VZ Access manager.  If you don't have Windows running in Parallels or VMWare you need to take the unit into a Verizon store for an update.  Quite a hassle.UPDATE -- 10/31/09Unfortunately the firmware update does nothing to address the problems I indicated above.  I have had no less than three disconnects with the device in the last 30 minutes and I am in sight of the tower!  I again repeat the above cautions.  This device is not for professional use.
0	I bought this MiFi thinking that I would swap it for my Aircard that I've been using on Verizon for several years. I was attracted by the ability to have up to 5 devices share one connection.Overall the device will allow up to 5 devices to share the connection. And the speeds have been decent - averaging about 1.5 mb.The problem i that this device constantly disconnects from the Internet and you are forced to wait for it to re-connect. It's not something everyone would notice (you can watch it by going to the control panel at the IP address 192.168.1.1).There are also some really odd problems such as not being able to update the firmware from a Mac not being able to initially turn on the device and have it work on AC power (I've always had to start it up unplugged and after it's connected attach it to the power cord).I think this is just a really cheap product that I would avoid. It's probably near end-of-life and there are much better (and faster) alternatives coming (see Sprint 4G Novatell).Before you buy - do a quick web search for issues around this model. I found many that I wish I'd known about BEFORE I made the purchase.
0	Purchased from ULIKE The digitizer arrived after a month and was defective.... several emails and pictures later they asked me to get a &#34;professional&#34; install sorry I will not pay someone $50 to install a $5 screen on a 30$ phone I am perfectly competent enough to install a 3g digitizer having done 10~ 3G/3GS without error  and countless iPhone 4/4S. Give me my money back i ordered it on ebay for 3.99 and 2 day shipping for free
2	I love my replacement glass it fits perfect and I have no problem what so ever I recommend this product.
0	I was extrememly unimpressed with this product!  The speaker cable did not fit right do I could not hear on the phone unless it was on speaker.  The earpiece speaker would not plug into the board correctly.
2	lasted for about one year before they damaged they are ok for the price
0	Shipping was prompt and courteous for this item.  It really really was nothing to complain about so I don't blame the seller all that much but the product is just defective.  My shuffle didn't charge and couldn't be detected on the computer.  I am not going to bother returning it because for the money I spent it's just not worth the time or aggravation.  So not worth it.
0	Doesn't work for 4th Generation iPod Shuffle. The charging adapters don't even work. Total Piece of Mung. AVOID. I also need 20 words so that I can post this review. Really Amazon? I have Prime with you guys and I have to do this 20 word thing? I said everything I needed to say about the product in less than 20 words.
0	Wow.  I thought that i couldnt loose at this price.  But i was WRONG!  These pens scratched and RUINED my screen protector!  Who knows what it would do to my actual ipad screen!  Not only am i out the $2.59.  Now i have to spend $25 for a new screen protector!!  I wish I could give it 0 stars!
2	sometimes you have to apply more pressure to get the device to recognize that you're using it and if you're not careful the tip comes off. good for something like playing games or if you're prone to losing small objects like I am!
2	You can get three of these for half the cost of one of the name-brand stylii. So even if one doesn't work - as was true for me - you've still got two of these cool little dealies for not much cash. They make drawing and We Rule farming a lot easier. I like it.
2	This unit sports a micro usb connector this is what ended up breaking on mine they are very flimsey.  The case makes it hard to move the ring/silent switch.  Over time the case will leave nice vertical scrapes on the back of the iphone.  Battery life is only so so at $80.00 I would not consider this accessory a very good deal.
2	The juice pack worked great for my mother's phone...and then it just up and died.  She had used it since Valentine's Day (her birthday) and two or three days ago 6/13/13 it just quit working.  Wasn't dropped wasn't damaged.  The product does as intended but the lifespan is quite poor.  Granted I paid less than $30 for the battery case but I would expect at least a 6 month lifespan.  I was not impressed but since it's one of the only cases on the market for the purpose without running a cord to a charger hidden in her purse I'll most likely buy again & take my chances.
0	I have to amend my original review (see below) after owning the item now for several months. I bought the Juice Pack Air in October despite others' complaints about signal strength sync not working and fragile build quality and I hadn't experienced trouble with any of these so I gave it four stars in my early review.I've now dropped it down after having problems. Before continuing I should note THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO REVISIONS OF THIS DEVICE OUT THERE; I know because I've now had two different revisions.PROBLEM 1: On my original Juice Pack Air the micro-USB connector broke after two months. Sad because I was very very satisfied with the product until that moment. I only found one or two other people around the web that mention this but two months after purchase the micro-USB connector on the case disappeared inside it one evening when I went to plug it in spelling doom for the case. After determining that I couldn't easily open it and fix it myself with a soldering iron or something I put in an RMA warranty service request via the Mophie website.Service was reasonably good. Never got a human call or response but I did get a UPS tag. I shipped them the broken case and a copy of my receipt using the tag (so I didn't have to pay for any shipping) and now two weeks later a new case has arrived. So thanks for the exchange Mophie but it is worrying that the connector isn't attached in a more substantial way (the replacement case is the same).PROBLEM 2: Oddly the replacement case (supposedly exactly the same product) doesn't fit the iPhone 3Gs nicely as my original case did. This one is a full 2mm longer (yes LONGER) meaning that there's a big empty gap (enough to slide a penny in) between the top of the phone and the top of the case. Yes the top IS seated all the way. It's also not nearly as tight. I know that people have complained about the tightness of the Juice Pack Air but I liked it. This one is still nicely made but it's now a much more slide on/slide off easily affair. Now the case feels less as though it will snugly protect the phone.PROBLEM 3: The replacement unit does indeed kill my signal strength (as others have reported) in a way that my first unit didn't. I wonder what they've changed between revisions that causes this?PROBLEM 4: Sync and charge behavior are frustratingly different with the new unit as well. Clearly there are highly different revisions of this piece of equipment out there. On my first Juice Pack Air sync worked transparently with the Mophie attached (just plug it in and the computer saw it) and charging was easy since I just left the switch on the bottom in the on position all the time and forgot about it. Plugging it into USB both the Juice Pack AND the iPhone would charge to full at the same time. Unplugging the Juice Pack would discharge first then the iPhone. Now both charging and sync behaviors are different.First sync no longer works with the juice pack attached (a problem many others have had). Second charging now works like this:- When I plug the juice pack in (either switch position) the actual iPhone doesn't charge at the same time (before no matter whether the switch was red or green both the iPhone AND the Juice Pack would charge in parallel if it was plugged in). Now when plugged in the iPhone continues to discharge and will eventually go flat even as the Juice Pack busily charges.- I have to set the switch to green to charge the actual iPhone but I MUST UNPLUG the Juice Pack from power for charging to occur (if it's plugged in and I switch to green the iPhone does not charge). And green or red the moment I plug the Juice Pack back into power the iPhone stops charging no matter the switch position. So basically: you can only charge the Juice Pack when plugged into power (not the iPhone). You can only charge the iPhone when not plugged into power (and then obviously you can't charge the Juice Pack).Getting a full charge for both from a full flat for both thus requires the following steps with the replacement unit:1. Plug in Juice Pack. Wait for it to charge (meanwhile iPhone goes dead and stays dead).2. Disconnect power flip Juice Pack to green. Wait for iPhone to charge (meanwhile Juice Pack runs down as it charges).3. Reconnect Juice Pack replace charge just used (of course when you plugged in the iPhone stopped charging and is now running down again while the Juice Pack charges).In short it's literally impossible to actually get both to a full charge at the same time unless I take the pack OFF of the iPhone and charge them separately. The first Juice Pack Air I had (the one that broke and was replaced under warranty) did NOT behave this way.I suspect that they changed the behavior to this because of the complaints I've read about overheating when both batteries were charging at the same time. I didn't experience that problem with my first Juice Pack though they did get quite warm.IN ANY CASE my new review is this: I'll continue to use the thing because I bought it and it does provide extra power. But it's a kind of grudging acceptance and frustration now rather than enthusiasm and I'm tempted to try to get ahold of one of the competing (and now discontinued no doubt due to similar types of problems) Incase Power Slider units to see if they're any better.Maybe there's just no way to do this right and Apple should consider releasing an extended battery version of the iPhone that's twice as thick for $200 more? I'd pay for it if it gave me double the battery life without all of this power case nonsense.----------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:So there I was sitting in the Apple Store in Manhattan trying to find a single case that protected the sync port at the bottom of the iPhone. Couldn't find one. But I did find the Mophie Juice Pack Air for less than twice the price of some of the basic black silicone cases being sold at the store.Not bad I thought but I wanted to read a review and see whether the thing was any good particularly since the Apple Store didn't have an open one on display for me to at least inspect the build quality. Some of the reviews complained about loss of signal strength much lower than advertised battery power and/or the inability to sync without removing the iPhone from the Mophie.I contemplated then I bought knowing that I could always return it if I hated it. Immediately upon buying I went straight over to the nearest horizontal surface opened it and installed it. Then I plugged it into the USB port on my laptop.(1) No signal strength degradation (knock on wood).(2) Computer found the iPhone and all was happy with syncing (knock on wood).(3) Later experience has shown that it gives me a good 70% boost in battery length (knock on wood).Apart from that I think the build quality complaints are really baseless. This is a beautifully finished very solid very nicely fitting (incredibly precise tolerances) piece of equipment. Those that are complaining sound like they're removing the case daily. WARNING: It's clearly not designed to be removed and replaced over and over again you can tell that just by looking at it. If you plan to remove it from your iPhone all the time this is not the case for you. (And thus if you plan to use your iPhone with all kinds of docks and docking accessories this is not the case for you.)This thing is clearly intended for people in good coverage areas who use the iPhone mostly on the go don't have a ready pile of iPhone accessories that require docking and need a nice cover and a boost in operation time.The only reasons I give it four stars rather than five: I have no idea how long the battery's lifetime will be; a lot of lesser rechargeable batteries tend to wear out after 20-30 cycles which I haven't yet gotten to on the Mophie and also the micro USB cable that comes with it is TOO DAMNED SHORT (like a foot and a half literally) and I had to buy a USB extension cable. Just make the cable longer guys.
0	*** April 23rd Update: Unfortunately the power switch on the unit failed within only 4 weeks of having it (and only light use) - the switch gradually moved deeper inside the unit until one day it separated completely and just rattled around inside the case so I have reduced my review from four to one star. The idea is great but the build quality of the unit is clearly substandard. I have no confidence a replacement will fare any better since this seems to be a design flaw - in trying to get my money back Mophie claim it is TechNGnet's problem to solve (the original seller) TechNGnet claim it is Mophie's problem. I am afraid my advice now is DO NOT buy this case from Mophie unless you are willing to flush seventy bucks down the drain.*** Original Review: I was a little hesitant to buy this battery case based on the feedback but I knew I still needed something to help my 3GS through a busy day. I had disabled Push and only used 3G sparingly in order to nurse my phone through a whole day and still ended up with low battery warnings at 4pm on some days.I already have a seperate battery but it is clumsy to carry that (plus cable) through the day and charging it each night required more organization than I was capable of. After researching all the alternatives I decided the Mophie Air was the best of the bunch available today even though I had concerns about the possible drawbacks.I received my Mophie 2 weeks ago and I am very happy with it so far. I knew about the issues ahead of time so my expectations were set accordingly.What works:The form factor is great - it makes the iPhone chunky but guess what - it actually feels better this way and is easier to hold when in use! Materials seem ok the case doesn't feel cheap and doesn't have garish brand names emblazoned on it just a nice low key mophie imprinted logo. Charge LEDs do the job. Case is snug but fits my 3GS OK and covers the whole phone back and top. Not sure how much protection it really provides but it has to be better than nothing.Battery Capacity:Not amazing but will recharge a dead phone to about 90% which is more than enough for a long day (or two short ones).Convenience:Perfect - always ready when you need it. Charging is simple plug it in at night with one cable and by morning you have a fully charged phone and case ready for the day. To enable charging when you are low on juice just flick a small recessed switch and your phone is charging back to life easy. Syncing works fine through the MicroUSB cable.Drawbacks:Cable - yes it's a microUSB which means your docks won't work unless you slide the case off each time - I wasn't really too bothered about this. Extra cables can be found online pretty cheaply.Mute Switch - you can't unmute with the case on you need to slide the top off to get to the switch. Irritating but not a dealbreaker.Reception - I haven't noticed the big drop in signal strength others have reported - might be a slight reduction but nothing that has given me any trouble (yet?)MicroUSB connector - people have complained that the connector breaks inside the phone after continued use - I haven't had any problems yet but I'm keeping an eye open for this.Price - it's pricy but if your iPhone is a primary tool for you then you'll appreciate the convenience and the investment will be worth it.Best illustrations of how it has saved me already -1) Business call that went much longer than planned battery was down to 7% - flicked the charger switch mid-call and I was good to go for the rest of the call (and day).2) Writing this review in Starbucks - 20% battery warning just came up but I don't care - it's just time to get the Mophie going.Overall this has completely solved my battery anxiety and made my iPhone a dependable device all day - highly recommended.I just confirmed that Blackberry Micro USB data cables work fine with the Mophie (they charge and sync) and can be purchased very cheaply from Amazon.
0	No wonder the price was so low this battery pack is so bad that with the iphone battery fully charged and this pack fully charged I cannot get not even 5 hours of use out of the phoneI noticed it from the beginning I should have returned this item right away.The newtrent I used to have outlast this one here by far
0	I bought this originally for the outrageous price of $90 but thought it would be worth it if it got me through a full day of heavy use on my iPhone. The first case worked for about 3 weeks and then stopped working (the case would hold a charge but not transfer any charge to my iPhone). I returned it (in the same box as my roomates whose mophie also stopped working at the same time) and received a new one no questions asked which is nice. But the new one barely works at all. It extends the life of my iPhone battery for an hour or two but doesn't charge the phone and it doesn't seem to work if my phone battery drops too low. For example if my phone is at 20% I attach the case and where I would normally only have maybe 30 min of talk time the mophie gets me 60 minutes but then the phone dies even though the mophie power meter says it has juice left. This has been a very disappointing product.
0	First be prepared to loose your signal.  Second the case does not protect your phone very well.  Buyer beware!
2	I have owned all the various iPhones and battery life is always a problem.  When I saw this I thought....great a protective case and a charger all built into one.  That would make life simpler.Well the unit is solidly built but it adds a lot of bulk and weight to the iPhone.  So much so that it defeats the sleek and glitzy design of the iPhone.  So I will stay with one of my little battery chargers that I can slip into my pocket and pull out when I need to add a bit of charge to the iPhone and use this for those occasions when I don't mind having the extra bulk.... like in the car driving somewhere as the phone sits in a drink cup holder.  Then again I could use my dc charger in those cases.  But you get the idea.It does the job.... but it comes at a price....added weight and bulk.
2	You purchase a unit for extended battery life and if you purchase this for 3GS you will be disappointed.  While the unit has a good finish I am careful with my stuff and especially anything with with Apple on it. I  have superglued several parts on after moderate use.  While it protects the phone well it is rather bulky. The battery after several complete charges looses I would say about 35% of its ability to hold a charge. This is not expectable in my view. These companies put a list of call times and video etc however it is a deceive rating system. I am going to try the Third Rail System for a 4S. The main reason I would want to try this is because of its slim profile & smart battery system. While a little on the pricey on for its 1250 mAh swap-out-battery. You can stack them i such a way to get you a weeks charge. Granted unrealistic but these batteries have several functions that you need to follow-up on line.
2	Everyone wants nuclear power like battery life on their portable electronics but unfortunately iphones dont give anywhere close to that.  The mophie juice pack allows you to add an external battery to make the overall battery life longer.  Great huh?  We'll maybe if the battery lasted longer.  The juicepack does in it self drain fast.  Maybe because the iphone thinks its plugged in and sucks more juice?  I dont know.There are some nice things about the juice pack though  It fits pretty flush and feels nice.  It has a battery life indicator on it.  You can tell when the battery is dead as the iphone will no longer look like its either charging or plugged in.Only way I like using this is when everything is all charged up.  I do not like putting the iphone in the juice pack when I know the juice pack will not charge it up all the way before dying.  This is bad for the iphones battery and will shorten its life.With this in mind if you still want to get it.  Do it.  Do it.
2	The Mophie Juice Pack Air Case for iPhone 3G and 3G S definitely will deliver more power for your iPhone. It does have some nicely thoughout features like the power indicator on the back and an ON/OFF switch.But I found more cons than pros. The case is shiny and slick; this is probably personal preference but a rubberized or non-slip surface provides a better grip and delivers less fatigue to the hand and arm as you don't have to grip it as tightly. Also I didn't expect to be able to dock the iPhone with this one but removing it takes more effort than it should for quick removal. Lastly and most importantly I can see a reduction in signal strength with this power pack case - as much as 50%; this is bad where I live as some areas barely get one bar and with the juice pack I am getting no bars in these areas.

2	this is my second morphie juice pack. both of them stopped charging after a couple of months. I do not recommend.
2	Being a heavy user of my iPhone 3G I really needed an extended battery. The Mophie has by far the best design. And it performs as advertised boosting my usage by double.Here's the down side:1. Heavy. Man is this thing a brick. But I need the extra battery life badly enough to put up with it.2. Fit and Finish. Had to return one because the top didn't line with the bottom on the right side. It stuck out so far you could tell it was an accident waiting to happen. The replacement's fit wasn't much better but I no longer feared it getting snapped off during use. If the left side could line up so flush why not the right Mophie?3. Hot. When you switch on the battery to charge your phone it gets substantially hot. Worrisome.4. Unique plug. The Mophie cord is actually sturdier than the Apple iPhone cord but I would have liked to have had the option to use my original cord. Plus the small plug on the Mophie end wiggles a bit too much for my liking.Thus the 3 star rating. Good. But could use some improvement.
2	This morphia case was too small for my phone had to send it back .  It was nice but did not fit.
0	Mophie should be ashamed.  This case does not protect the phone very well and you loose most of your signal while the battery case is on.  Buyer beware!
0	I used the original Mophie Juice pack with my 3G. I had it for 6 or 9 months & I wore it out until it wouldn't take a charge.  The outer appearance deteriorated by then but it performed to the end.  I was perfectly satisfied.  When I got the 3GS and the Juice Pac Air came out I got one right away.  I had it for 3 months & it's busted.  The cable had a problem so I got it replaced through the website.  Today the connector on the case itself no longer connects to the cable.  I tried my new cable my old cable & my wife's cables & nothing.  No lights no iTunes no phone vibrating nothing.  It's been only 3 months.  I don't know if it's the design the build quality or the micro USB connector.  (the Mini USB connector was fine & tested for years so I don't know why they changed it)DON'T BUY this battery case.  Go back to the Juice Pack or wait for the next generation.
2	I bought three of these and had no problem with two.. However this purple one keeps showing a notice on the screen that it is not compatible with IPhone. When you plug it in the battery pack charges but the IPhone doesn't.
2	My fianc&eacute; and myself use these mophie packs on our iPhone 3GS phones. I understood that these cases were used when I purchased them.But I assumed they would give our phones at least 1/2 to a 3/4 charge per full charge of the mophie case per phone.Unfortunately we don't even get that much out of a full charge.Well I guess it's my fault I should have bought new.But In my defensei truly believe products need to be given a more truthful and acurate description by the sellers. Aswell as holding the sellers more liable for selling merchandise that should just be trashed or recycled!Granted I only paid $10 each. but if I knew the condition of these packs before hand I never would have purchased them!!!To  Amazon:It's just a thought maybe there should be a way for describing used products in More detail? Say a star rating system for physical condition functionality etc. etc...I know it! I'm weird! But it's just a thought!!
2	It's sale price was good.  But it doesn't fit good & is not as comfortable as it would be with a solid adjustable head band.
2	These work. Pair quickly and easily and sound quality is good.However I am disappointed in the build of these headphones. They are made of cheap plastic. All of my phones have been Motorolas: Droid 2 Droid 2 Global Droid X and Droid X2. Before that is was the Motorola Razr and Krazr. The reason that I stick with Motorola is that they have been very dependable for me. These headphones are not up to par.I could easily snap these in half by stepping on them or if one of the kids were to get ahold of them they'd be goners for sure. I would feel unsafe wearing these outside around the pool or even just in my car traveling with them to hotels and such. I will only use these at home due to the poor build.Step it up Motorola. It is a common assumption that a full bluetooth headset should sound better than a one piece bluetooth. However my Motorola Finiti has better sound quality than these. I would recommend looking elsewhere or try out the Motorola Finiti. Great sound quality for music and puts this product to shame. Step it up Motorola and don't cheapen down your brand name that I have came to know and love.Based on the reviews it appears that I am in the minority as far as being disappointed by these but I'm always totally honest in my reviews and I was honestly disappointed by this headset.Motorola FINITI Bluetooth Headset - Motorola Premium Packaging
2	Good headset for casual use.  Not so good for active lifestyle.  If you plan to jog with it your sweat will eventually corrode the paint on the headset making it look rather ugly.  Other than that I had no problems with it over a 6 month use.
2	I wanted to give this product 5 stars because even though there are a couple of respectable drawbacks I still use them a lot. 3.5 stars would be more accurate I think...I listen to a lot of music and I listen to it most of the day while at work.  My tastes are mixed.  Everything from Motzart to Steve Roach (ambient) to Rush (progressive rock) to pop (tons of 80's 90's).  I wanted wireless music from my DroidX2 phone which is what I use.The Good:  The electronics work well.  Pretty darn good sound quality but I have a pair of $10 ear buds that have a better bass sound than these.  Even so the sound quality is easily acceptable unless you are really into hearing the slightest instrumental nuances in your music.  I'm very happy with the sound.The ability to use this product for a phone headset is fantastic.  I mean it's really good.  Incoming voice is very clear and I have yet to hear a complaint about my transmitions.  I really like that the caller's voice is in both of my ears.  Absolutely no compaints as it does exactly what it is supposed to do.Works great with my laptop after using a Medialink - USB Bluetooth Adapter which fits right into my laptop's USB port.The bad:  The erganomics of these headphones are not as good as they should be.  It will hurt my head after while.  I can only assume that a smaller head would have less trouble.  I wear a 7 1/2 hat size which puts me at a med/small and I will get sore ears and/or a headache after wearing these for an hour or more.Having said that it isn't so uncomfortable that I have to take them off until I've been at it for 3 or 4 hours.  I listen to them at work so that amount of time isn't always enough.  Of course ideally they wouldn't give me a headache at all.  ;-)The controls aren't so easy to use.  The raised + / - signs that indicate the up and down volumn buttons aren't very helpful.  I have just gotten used to 'knowing' where to press for volumn control.  The Skip Forward and Backward in playlist bottons don't seem to work with PowerAMP which is a very popular app I use on my Droid.Finally the plastic loop that runs behind your neck and connects the two speakers WILL WARP IF LEFT IN THE SUN AND WILL NOT BEND BACK.  I left mine in the car for about an hour and the loop is now a bit more curved on one side than it should be making the headphones a tad less comfortable to wear.  I should have known but just didn't think about it.In conclusion I would recommend these headphones because they do what is advertised and aren't too uncomfortable to wear for my head size so long as it's not for more than 3 hours or so at a time.  Your mileage will likely vary by size comparison.
0	I bought these to run with an 3rd gen iPod touch.  They are relatively comfortable although I would definitely prefer an ear bud.  Problem with ear buds when you run is sweat makes them slip out so this is a good alternative.  The downside to these is that they don't really get loud enough--the volume control is kind of limited.  Otherwise if you need an inexpensive wireless headset just to work out I'd recommend.  If you're looking for great sound for listening enjoyment look elsewhere.Update:  I had to return these headphones; the volume control just stopped working altogether and I could never get the music to get above the external noise around me.  Skip these...there are better products out there!  I plan to get the Sony Ericsson Bluetooth ear buds...
2	Somewhat delayed key responses and uncomfortable behind the ears. Sound output is decent No adjustment behind the ears so either it fits or it won't.
2	The quality of these headphones is pretty cheap.  The buttons are awkward the power button is sometimes fickle and don't let even the slightest bit of sweat or moisture hit them.  Had them for about a month and they are completely useless now.  Waste of money.  Going to buy cheap (yet more durable) Rocketfish brand.
2	I had these headphones since November 2012 and over the time it has proven to be cheaply made bends out of shape easily. On the up and up sound quality is good.
2	This model headset is comfortable unfortunately its not as loud as I expected. Even on max volume the audio levels are pretty low. On a bus I'm having trouble listening to music or video on max volume. Had to cover the headset with my hand to hear anything at all and its hard because I accidentally press the buttons on the side of the headset when I cover them with my hand. The volume controls are also hard to get to. The buttons are small and close together every time I want to adjust the volume I have to guess what I'm pressing.
2	We eventually returned these because they were not staying on my head during workouts.  I was mostly running and doing some weights.  The weight of the earphones was ok.  The sound was good but these are best suited for sitting at a desk and listening to music.  I would recommend these for workouts.
2	The shipping was timely. The headset felt pretty cool on my head. However it kept breaking up when I'd listen to the music. To be fair it could have been my phones lack of adequate memory. I tried it on two other phones. One time it did the same thing the other time it didn't. The other phones were the Fender phone from T-Mobile and an Iphone from Sprint respectively. The main phone I tried was the My Touch 3G from T-Mobile. The sellers were great to do business with except that I had to pay for the return shipping twice.
0	They work great but when using the buttons on the headphones it feels like they could fail at any given time.  The buttons do work though and I'm not going to judge them on what I think will happen.  I'll downgrade and explain why if I have an issue but for now they're a good bang for the buck and it beats getting tangled up at the gym.Dropped from 4 to 3 stars because of short battery life and the foam keeps falling off.Edit:Don't know why my last edit didn't stick but they stopped working after about 3 months of occasional use.  I was able to return them for a partial refund.  Steer clear!
2	These are great because of the fact there are no wires. Sound is soso not as good as a set of over the ear muff style. Better than the in ear because if you jog you hear the wire movin against your body. Bluetooth reaches alot further than I thought it would and goes thru the walls at least at work. The bad if you run or sweat alot during you workouts it will ruin the headphones. I had mine over the time limit to return them to Amazon and only had them for a couple months and I do run alot. Motorola is sending me another set but I have to pay for return shipping of the broken headphones to them. What happend is the headphones would take forever to charge then eventually wouldnt charge at all. Be aware Motorola's warranty says does not guarantee against excessive persperation.
2	I own a variety of different bluetooth devices and I've never experienced a dis-connectivity issue such as this one. I'm in the same room as the source at about 15 feet max and the sound cuts in and out. The unit is fully charged and everything. Additionally due to its packaging it retained a sort of twisted shape which is taking some time to untwist so it sits kind of uncomfortable on the head. Again very disappointed I planned on hacking these and putting them in my snow board helmet but now I don't think that's such a good idea.
2	For the price it does what is supposed to no more no less.The over the ear band going in the back of the head is not very comfortable and quality of the sound is acceptable but not very good which should be expected at 40$ plus.Some obvious distrortion out of left side at 75% volume level straight out of the box.Very handy to use for call conferencing (using either skype or Microsoft Lync) and let's you move about your office/workstation.For conference call purpose I will make these my main headphones/headset but for music I will stick to my original Zune earbuds (best earbuds I have had so far and I have tried them all. I even prefer the Zune earbuds over Bose noise cancelling Quiet Comfort headphones).
2	This bluetooth headset has great sound for both calls and music.  Worked with my iPhone 4S right out of the box I didn't have to do anything extra to make it play music over the iPhone's built in iPod.  Haven't tested it with my iPad yet but I bet it'll work fine.  I did try for a longshot and connected it to my macbook pro but no sound came out.  Maybe there's a trick to it.  That would be a great bonus if it could do that!  It only gets 4 stars because I can't lay down in bed with it on.  :)UPDATE:  The headset has started losing its shape and has become very uncomfortable to wear.  The hard plastic that goes behind my neck twists up and won't stay even on both sides so I'm constantly having to try and bend it back into shape.  Don't really wear them anymore because of this.
2	I really liked these at first the price is right the styling is fine the sounds is ok. Everything you would want from a cheap pair of wireless headphones.But they are just not made to take much abuse. I've had them less than 2 months and already the volume button is broken (I can only turn the volume down not up and half the time hitting up just turns it down so that now the volume is so low I can't actually hear anything through them). I suspected this would be the case since right from the start I could hear the buttons (annoyingly) rattle while running. Honestly the headphones are fine if there was just a more robust button design. Now comes the fun prospect of dealing with amazon and/or motorola to see if I can get them replaced...UPDATE: called motorola and they're sending me a new pair. I'm somewhat doubtful that the new pair will last very long either but I suppose I'll find out.
2	Any1 that's had bluetooth stereo headset knows how bad they sound and these are no exception. U buy these for the convenience of no wire coming out of ur pocket that's connected to a cell phone or other electronic. But u DO suffer audio-wise. Great if you just want something to listen to while walking around or exercising so take it for what it is and NOT an audiophile headset lol.That aside this headset:1: digs into the top of ur ears(plastic with no padding)2: has bad audio quality3: has good button set once u get used to it4: has decent battery life at least a day of listening to music. U charge it every night u should be fine.5: since it's bluetooth it also has a crappy range like 20 feet.If you know these things then they're worth every penny.
0	Had these headphones for a year and then static started coming out of the left ear piece.  So loud it is painful.  even when turned off it keeps making static.  Nothing I've tried has rectified it.  Guess it's time for a new pair of headphones which won't be Motorola.
0	I've had two pair of these now.  When they work they are perfect for me but after a few months both of them stopped working.  I mainly use them while riding a bike so maybe the sweat is the problem.  When the first set stopped working I thought I just did something.  But now the second set stopped in the same manner.
2	When the headphones are nearly fully charged they work pretty well.  Simple activate bluetooth on my phone turn on the headphones and hit play on the headphones and I'm off.  My completely enjoyment ends however when the headphones connect but nothing on them works in this case I have to reset my bluetooth connection between the two devices by unpairing and repairing the connection.  Unfortunately this happens about every 5th time I use them.  On top of that the sound quality is certainly not magnificent with little to zero bass and should you have your phone/music player in the opposite pocket to the headphone's receiver in which case you will enjoy the frequent dead pockets in the music where the connection fails.  30ft? I don't think so.  I believe this is caused by the movement of my pocket however because I can set my phone on my desk and walk across the room and into the hallway without being interrupted.  The good news is however that they are PERFECT for biking where you don't want a cord in the way they're also superb for making calls as they have a push-to-talk feature built in which works rather well.  On top of that call quality is rather good in the past using bluetooth headphones I was frequently asked if I was on speakerphone and told that it sounded like I was breaking up however with these headphones I had essentially zero problems with hearing the person and zero problems with them hearing me.  Oh yea and the battery life is no where NEAR advertized.  It's like 3 hours of constant use (highish volume though)Summary:  Good headphones that are not without their problems.  If your budget is limited go ahead and buy them if you COULD spend 80 bucks on some good ones then probably get those instead.
2	Sounds Quality - Only the right earpiece is equipped with base. The left sounds like a morning fart when turning it up. Sounds fair on a low to medium volume.Voice quality - have not tested yet will update you on the receiving end of it.Connection - Easily picked-up by iphone4. Just make sure wait for 7 secsProduct quality - fair for lightweight earpiece.Cables - Only comes with usb charging cable. Have to use iphone 110W female adapter. Freakin' cheap companyManual - straight forward piece of paperCase - Feels like an egg tray quality with a zipper. Can probably hold 3 broken eggs insideValue - Might keep it  for the price and i hate mailing it in return.
2	The unit is very flimsy; I'm afraid it will break with even the gentlest handling. The on/off switch is small and easily blocked from view when turning the headset on or off. Other controls are equally inaccessible. The sound quality is very average.On the other hand RF-MAB2 Bluetooth Stereo Headset by ROCKETFISH is an outstanding value. Superior sound quality durable and the controls are much more easily accessed than the Motorola unit. The fit is quite tight but with patient adjustment can be made acceptable. This unit is also available on Amazon.
0	Problem 1 - I bought these because in the details it said it would pair with 2 devices at the same time. I followed the directions and paired it with my iPhone 4S and then turned them both off turned the headphones back on and paired it with my iPad 2. I then turned everything off. I turned my iPhone and then my iPad back on and finally the headphones and they would only connect with 1 device. I wanted to be able to watch videos on my iPad and still answer my phone with these. I could not do that.Problem 2 - So after this happend I decided to try it with just my iPhone and listen to music the music sounded fine but when I made phone calls there was an echo and the person on the other end told me I sounded terrible. I tried restarting everything and still had the same problem.Problem 3 - After wearing these for about 2 hours my ears were killing me they were very uncomfortable!Needless to say I returned these the day after I got them.
2	I've used several brands of Stereo Bluetooth headsets from Jabra to Plantronics to Motorola. I was mostly obsessed with getting ear bud style bluetooth headsets and did not want to give the over the ear ones a try. I thought they would get more sweaty at the gym or cause me to feel uncomfortable with the bulk but I was wrong!  These light weight S305's are fantastic.  The sound is about as good as bluetooth headsets can get. I do 45 minutes to an hour of weight training and 30-40 minutes of cardio in these and I often forget I'm wearing them.With my old ear bud style ones I would constantly have to re-adjust them during my workout. I would have a hard time skipping tracks and adjusting volume because the the buttons were so small and hard to use. With these S305's the button placement is excellent and easy to use and the only time I have to adjust them is when I do incline bench press but even that got easier to deal with after a few workouts.I have taken a few phone calls with these and those sound great too. The other party can hear me clearly and I can hear them clearly. I will say that if you are outside taking a phone call and there is a some wind the other party will hear the wind noise and it can become annoying on longer calls.  This is a minor complaint since I mostly use these for music and if I take a call with them I'm usually at home not outside.Overall I highly recommend these Motorola S305's. The price is excellent at $30-35 and they seem durable. I've been using them for over a month now and I will not go back to earbud style headphones again.QUICK TIP: If you sweat in them DO NOT charge them right away. When you get home let them sit for several hours (or overnight) before you charge them. Charging them after you sweat in them is a great way to fry the battery and burn them out.  The battery life is excellent and you should be able to get at least 3-4 workouts with them before they need charging.Edit: Well after 3.5 months the unit broke. The volume button stopped working on them. Too late to return them to Amazon but Motorola is going to replace them. I just have to pay to ship it back to them.  If the replacement breaks I will probably look to buy the Kinivo BTH220.  They seem sturdier than these Motorola's. I am a little disappointed that these don't cut out any outside noise at all (like zero noise cancelling). The foam pads barely touch my ears so I can hear all outside noise. The guy next to me was stomping as he ran on the treadmill and I could barely hear my own music.
0	Really bad battery life connection was lost more often that i liked. Will not buy this thing again. What's more i'm not sure i will buy Bluetooth headsets again.
2	Im not sure if the pair which I received became warped or if that is how they were intended to be designed but they do not fit well at all. They wrap around the head as advertised but the back of the wrap hits the bottom of my neck and the earphones are not rotated as far as they should be. this causes the forward (>>) button to be not pointing forward towards my face but pointing down towards my chin. This strange setup also causes the headphones not to sit flat against the ears but are awkwardly angled slightly outwards.I really hope that this was just a defected pair that I received but based on mine I would not recommend this product to anyone with a normally sized and shaped head. Maybe Shaq would like them.
2	Weird it seems as if Motorola is buying stuff and placing their name on it and calling it good.  These are horrible at reception I couldn't even put my phone in my pocket without having spotty coverage.****I own another Bluetooth headset that I would recommend Rocketfish RF-MAB2 $60 at Bestbuy $35 on Ebay.  Owned for more than 1 year excellent range and battery life****
2	After less than 3 months of use they quit working.  I looked into fixing them but seemed easier to just replace them.  The sound was fantastic and when they worked they were great for phone calls.  Not good for fitness at least not for me - too fragile.  I didn't like how easy it was to hit the buttons on the side of the ear phones so you could accidentally fast forward re-dial etc.  They were nicely priced and I read others had much better luck than me but I'm done with them for now.
2	When I first got this headset I was very pleased but then I started having a lot of problems with the battery that don't last long. Now it's not working at all every time I charge it use it for a little while then turn it off the next time I tried to use it it's dead and I have to recharge it again... So basically now I have to charge it every time I want to use them...I don't recommend this product... bad quality...
2	The headset is comfortable while wearing.  Problem is that they lose signal a lot while using and every now and then break up.
2	These headsets pair easily and have good battery life. However Bass response is low unless you jack up the bass with an equalizer (using it with Android) and being a non adjustable behind the neck design you can't enjoy them while laying down on a pillow as the ear pads will rise up above your ears. Next time I would get an over the head pair.
2	I had one pair break after a few months use so far the next pair have been holding up okay. They sound good but I am not an audiophile. When used for calls clarity was generally quite good and people generally didn't know I was on a Bluetooth headset. I have some concerns about durability after the first pair died so quickly. The headphones generally linked reliably with a Galaxy Nexus and Motorola Triumph. I didn't track battery life too closely but it seemed about in line with the specs. Any questions just ask.
2	Sound quality is good for listening to spoken word things such as TV shows and podcasts.  It does not have a great range for action movies or music.  Volume range is sufficient I often use this in the kitchen so I don't have to turn my speakers on excessively loudly.  It's a good value if you do not need high quality sound.I have this connected to an Android phone and a Win7 PC.  Both were simple to set up.
2	These paired easily enough with my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Call sound and mic functioned well.  Music wasn't bad.  But after less than a half hour these things were hurting my ears - right where they wrap up and over the ear.  Guessing they aren't for people with bigger heads.
2	These worked for a few months and went dead. I liked them while they worked. I wish they lasted longer tho.
2	These are extremely clever headphones.  They cram many many features into a tiny package.  They are unfortunately poor on two key counts if you're interested in using them to listen to music.  The first is that the bluetooth feature for listening to music just didn't work well and was easily disrupted either by moving around in relation to the source of the bluetooth broadcast or when using my iPad or iPhone if I were using any other apps on the device.The comfort of these headphones was also poor and the behind the neck placement irritating if I were sitting.  The headphones pinched too tightly on my head and the grip or tension was not adjustable.  After a relatively short time the pressure on my ears was unacceptably painful.  The behind the head placement of the loop connecting the individual earpieces is nominally a good idea but because the loop of the headset is fairly large it sticks out behind and down the neck.  This doesn't work for sitting in a chair or reading propped up in bed - the headphones are jammed forward by the loop or levered up depending on how the loop hits the chair or bedframe and pillow.  Either way not comfortable not workable.
0	I purchased these headphones because I am really hard on the corded kind and I find myself needing to replace them every year or two. A bluetooth headset seemed like the way to go. Unfortunately it did not turn out to be the case. Sound quality is decent and charge time is okay but sadly this thing cannot maintain the Bluetooth connection with my iPhone. Every few minutes the connection weakens and sound stutters and even cuts off for a few seconds. Given that I keep my phone in my shirt pocket the distance from the phone to the headphones is less than 2 feet yet the connection fails. Not what I'd call a reliable product. I would definitely not buy this again. Total waste of money.
2	After reading all of the incredibly positive reviews about this product I figured I'd give it a shot and buy a pair. After a couple weeks with it and using it mainly to pair with my Motoactv on workouts I can say that they are just OK. The sound quality is very good the ease of use is high and they feel very comfortable. The biggest issue I'm encountering is while I'm out on runs the audio will skip or cut out for seconds at a time and then come back. This happening once or twice an hour would be fine but this is happening once or twice per song which is unacceptable. If I had to guess I'd say that the erratic playback is due to sweat causing problems with the headset since there is minimal to no issues when they're dry. The Motoactv shows no signs of issue with a wired headset during these times too so I don't think that's the problem. I'll give them another week before saying goodbye and trying a different product. It's a shame too these guys are solid otherwise.UPDATE: 12/27/2012: Returned these and went with the Moto S11's and won't be looking back. They are far superior for workouts than these headphones. These have better audio but didn't serve the purpose I needed them for. Because of that I will keep my rating as is and not knock it because it wasn't the perfect fit for me. They are still a solid product.
2	I was excited when I first saw these headphones. More and more I've been using my iPhone to listen to music but the Apple headphones were less than great and I'm terrible about wired stuff. A few times a day during my work I rip the headphones out of my ear or send the phone onto the floor while reaching for something on my desk.When I got these phones they paired immediately with my phone no messing around!The sound was ok but not terribly loud and thats saying something because I don't blast my music.But I could learn to live with this.The one thing thats a deal breaker for me is the fact that these are behind-the-head earphones.I think I was a little blinded by the price that I didn't really take notice of that fact.If you're planning on lying back in bed or an easy chair for a nap with your new headphones forget it. Incredibly uncomfortable trying to put your head on a pillow. This was very disappointing for me but absolutely my fault.They would have gotten a 5 star if it weren't for this one thing.All-in-all I'd recommend them but remind about that one caveat.
2	This headset worked great for a couple of months.  I was able to control my iTunes on my iPhone 4.  Unfortunately they stopped working for me.  It may have been too much sweat/moisture as I was using them while running.  I'm not sure but I'm now in the market for another bluetooth headset and I will not be getting these again.
0	after a few months they stopped accepting the charge. The sound quality is good but i expected them to last longer
2	I wanted a pair of behind-the-head headsets for comfort reasons. These fit okay but the user ergonomics are not to my liking.The volume controls are not tactile marked: I can't tell when I am on the + or - volume controls by touch. And to make matters worse when the mode changes so does the volume. These headphones are capable of a high level so you can unexpectedly wind up having your ears blasted - without in my case the means to quickly adjust the volume.I wanted to use these with Skype and have the freedom to walk away from the computer when necessary. You don't get far with these: I managed about 10 feet away from the computer in repeated tests before the Bluetooth connection was lost.The audio feed from my music source did not shut off when I initiated a call. In fact as soon as the call started ringing the volume of the music shot up to its highest level.Overall this unit offered the comfort level and fit that I was looking for - but none of the really useful things I need. Your experience may vary.Jerry
2	i've used about a dozen stereo bluetooth headsets.  my stupid dog eats them somewhat regularly.  these were ok but subpar and not worth the price.this was my favorite of the 4 motorola stereo BT headsets i purchased over the years although i found off-brand options that were better:Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo Headphonei also used the s9 s9hd and s10 headsets from motorola.  these were all ok above average sound quality but they would constantly come out my ears enough to lose all the bass response: plus if you're wearing those in-ear designs while out walking you're as good as deaf: at least with these over the ear ones you can hear the outside world if you keep the volume at a reasonable level.
0	the cheap plastic band that goes behind your head is huge and sticks out like a wing behind your neck.  if you look up it hits your neck and moves the heaphones.  the band is not adjustable - big design flaw.also the max volume level is horrible - you can easily hear noise around you with it turned all the way up.
2	I am shocked and dissappointed in the sound quality from these headphones! They sound cheap and tinny. The device works fine and has a beautiful appearance but they sound like something found in the dollar bin at Dollar General. I have the Motorola SD-10 bluetooth headphones and love them. I can't believe the same company makes both. These are simply terrible!
2	Bluetooth pieces are falling off the market like flies off a baker's apron.  But this piece is probably one of the worst sound quality devices you can wrap around your ears.  The Bluetooth makes a very poor connection to your cell phone device and looses and regains connection strength as you are using it.  The result is a very poor sound quality experience.  Not recommended.
0	Bad choice if you want to get them for music.Bad choice if you want to use this with your Sony Bluetooth supporting phone (like Sony Walkman series. Any latest phone)I understand that you dont expect them to do good as Bose in 30 bucks but jWin comes in same price but gives better quality.I think Motorola can never do good in this music earphones thing.With Sony phone (& sometime with iPhone too) the quality was too bad.Sound was like was being interrupted every few seconds.Come on we are in 2010. Bluetooth should be no magic should work !!
2	The fit worked for me although it gets in the way if you wear glasses and makes annoying clicking while running. The sound was better than average for running headphones although used with Motorola ACTV watch it cuts out on the backswing during the run. The buttons are easy to use and make sense. Battery life is about 5 hours when you first get it; within a month or so it drops down to about 45 minutes on a full charge before the damn thing starts beeping (low battery indication) at you until it turns off after another 30 minutes or so.
2	These were awesome headphones until the volume button snapped inside. Could no longer turn up the volume and rendered the headphones useless as I managed to get them stuck all the way at the absolute lowest volume setting trying to get it to work again.Expected a lot more out out of a $50 product.
2	It may be my ears but it gets irritating and painful after a while...for me anyway.  They cut too (the music I mean) once in a while but definitely worth the whole 3 stars  for sound quality and price.
2	I have purchased two sets of these and I would give the battery charge ease of connection/use and range all an A++ rating.  However I was using these at the gym where I do sweat a lot.  The first pair lasted me about 4 months but the second pair only about 60 days until they died.  Only thing I can think of is the sweat is killing them??  Great if you want to use in office or sitting at home doing nothing but if you are looking for some you can use while working out/running I would like to another product it might be worth getting a new pair every 4 months but every 2 months?  More trouble than they are worth at that rate.
0	You need an average cranium the sound is not super the microphone is tinny and people had a hard time hearing me. You can go a long way from the phone and retain connection though!
2	So I got these along with the Sennheiser MM100's and Motorola S9-Hd's from a store going out of business (I'll be reviewing both at a later date). My test-bed was an iPhone 3Gs.The first pair I tried was the S9-HD's. These sounded pretty good and the fit was nice.The second pair I tried were the Senns and wow. These were pretty impressive. I thought there was no way a pair of bluetooth 'phones could compete with wireds but alas I was wrong. While not acoustically perfect (slightly anemic bass) these sound amazing.This brings me to the S305's. These look nicer than the Senns but that's where the overtaking positives end. The sound is quite flat with a slight tinnyness to it and has very little bass. The bass gets a little better if you press the phones against your ear but who wants to do that? I tried every single eq setting and none made a difference. That being said the iPhone is noted for having a relatively flat response but the Senns offer decent bass response. Heck even the S9-HDs have a relatively good low end. So there's no reason this particular set doesn't. And I'm not talking bass-head low end. I'm talking enough to provide a balance fill. The second issue I take with these is they aren't particularly comfortable and make my ears sore after just a few minutes of use.Don't get me wrong these aren't terrible. But not something to rave about either. There are better headsets for the price. (i.e. if you don't mind in-ear the Moto S9-HD's are a good bet).
0	I liked everything about this headset.  Until I wore them to the gym and worked up a sweat.  Everything was fine until I finished my workout and tried to turn them off.  Nothing happened - held down the power button and they just kept blinking.  I let them run out of power (and dry out) and charged them again.  They worked fine for 30 minutes.  Once I worked up a sweat they started cutting in and out and finally just made a buzzing noise and wouldn't turn off.  I let them dry out again and they worked fine for two days.  Then I went back to the gym and sure enough once I worked up a sweat they started cutting in and out and then started buzzing.  I got so fed up that I stomped on them and threw the remains into the nearest trash can.  I wish I had sent them back for a refund but I lost my temper.In any case they were excellent until they stopped working properly.
0	I bought this headphones in January 2012. It worked well for couple if month but then started bad times when my return window is closed. Automatically disconnected from the phone without a reason. Worked well with Skype sometimes. I need to connect the headphone then start the skype app in my iPhone and log-in. (you need to follow this order). Then it'll work for the first call I make. If I want to hang up and make another Skype call then I have to disconnect the headset log off from Skype and follow the above steps again. Finally + volume controller stopped working. So I couldn't use it anymore. Too bad!
2	These headphones are great sounding but they are very uncomfortable on your head. If you are looking for some basic wireless head phones then these are the ones you should buy simply because of the price.
2	I decided to buy this headset because it has over 1000 reviews mostly positive. However these are my points of assessment:Comfort: I don't know what most people consider to be comfortable but this set does not fit for me. It feels awkward with its ark at the rear of my head and it does not hug my ears snugly enough. When I lean back against my high sofa seat or pillows the beam behind my head gets in the way and pushes the set off my ears since it is not precisely snug around the rear of my head.I also wear reading glasses and the bow of the set gets into a room crisis/conflict with the branches of my glasses right behind and above my ears. There is room for one of those but not for the both.I wanted to use it for two things: as my speaker system for the laptop and at the same time to use as the blue-tooth for my iPhone-4. The sound quality for music and sound files played from my laptop is poor compared to the Plantronics DSP 400 I have been using until now. For my iPhone I tried to pair it 3 times. I turned it off then on again to be discovered. It signaled that it was paired for phone calls but upon testing it by calling my husband's iPhone-4 I never got to hear anything in the headset. I had to turn to the phone's speaker system instead. Maybe it needs that separate adapter that they also mention (although they claim it works with the iPhone guaranteed.For all these poor performance reasons it goes back into the box and returned for a refund.
2	Pros: light weight Micro USB charger controls are easy to use.Cons:Uncomfortable - The loops that go around your ear are hard plastic and dig into the side of my head I wear a 7-1/4 hat size.  The loop that goes behind my head sticks straight out about an inch off the back of my head so with a high back chair I'm always bumping the back of the headset.Does not work as advertised - This is supposed to connect to two devices at a time but it doesn't work with a phone and computer or two phones.  Even if I set the phone for calls and the computer for audio it still won't stay connected to both at the same time which is really disappointing since that's exactly why I got it.
2	I primarily bought this headset for using with my iPad on the treadmill in the gym to watch podcasts.It does have good sound and is very easy to pair and use.However it is very cheap quality. The shining part looks like metal but is really metallized plastic....you know like the one in cheap products.Also another issue is that if you use it for jogging or while working out your ears sweat and the sweat gets on the foam ear muffs. Well you cannot remove the foam to rinse once in a while as you can with some standard headphones.If you don't mind these issues it is really good value for money.
2	These headphones work well and have quite good sound for the price. Had no connection problems with a variety of devices. The problem was that they are far and away the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever had. Tried to get used to it. Couldn't.
0	I used these for about a month of running during which I ran about 50 miles.  The sweat and light mist from that month (never did I run in the rain) caused these to go out.  Don't buy these with the expectation they are even somewhat rugged.  I don't know what else somebody would use them for if not exercising...
2	I bought these to use with my Galaxy tab and i am not impressed the sound is ok but for what i paid for I was expecting a lot more.
2	I purchased the Motorola S305 in January 2013.  In November 2014 the battery no longer holds any charge.  I don't think I ever got &#34;6 hours&#34; of use out of it.  The most was a little over two hours.  In the past 3 months the unit was running one hour at most and steadily declined.  It got down to 15 minutes now no more.  Less than two years.Phone call quality is fair to poor.  Indoors in a quiet place call quality is good.  Fair means that people on the other end of the line might mention about the call quality and background noise.  Poor means people say they can't  understand the call.I'm not a great judge of sound quality my hearing is not good I do wear behind the ear hearing aids at times.  One thing I like is that this headset does fit with the hearing aids on or off.  And I also wear glasses.  The unit fits with or without any combination of glasses hearing aids.  Music speech and other audio sound very good with or without the hearing aids -- the unit sounds much better that sound from the various Thinkpad and Mac laptops I use.  After an hour+ with the hearing aids glasses however my ear tips do feel a pinch.The headphones fit my big 7 5/8+ size head.  I have worn them for intense workouts in the gym and during active yard work on hot days.  A lot of sweat doesn't seem to bother them.I have had no problem syncing these with my Android phones and with my Panasonic Bluetooth DECT 6.0+ home wireless phone base station.  I also have used these iPod Nano 6 with a bluetooth adaptor.  The Nano  was only able to drive the micro adaptor for a little over a hour though.  Functionality with the nano and the adaptor was good pause fwd/rev all controllable via the headphone buttons.  Syncing with my Macbook Pro was tricky and  in the end not really reliably functional mainly due the Mac's poor Bluetooth handling of units like this headset with a mix of both Stereo-playback  and phone-headset bluetooth protocols.I like the buttons all on the right ear piece.  It took a few days of use to get the button positions down but now I find they come easily naturally.I have just ordered a different manufacturer's model as a replacement.
2	So the purchase I'm reviewing is actually my second set. I bought my first set just about a year ago and they crapped out after about 6 months of use. I wanted to write a really angry review about it but in reality these were like $30 and for that $30 they did a hell of a job.I mostly wear these for my pedestrian/bus/train commute to work. The audio quality is great for both calls and audio. It's definitely much better than many $20 price range headsets/earbuds but it's probably not audiophile quality either. I don't know because I'm not that hardcore into sound quality. I'm told the mic picks up quite a bit of background noise but none so bad that I can't complete my calls. I'm not sure if my phone or the headset is to blame but you see lots of Bluetooth interference on busy streets resulting in skipping. Certainly nothing so bad I can't deal with it though.Micro USB ports and easy pairing also make this a plus. They're great for my purposes but I think my last ones crapped out due to sweat from walking during my commute so I definitely wouldn't recommend for workouts. Otherwise these are almost certainly worth the $30.
0	After reading all the good reviews on Amazon I finally decided to buy this headphone because I have an iTouch (with the latest 3.1.2 firmware) and I wanted a wireless headphone for the freedom that it offers. I got it in a day after ordering using Amazon's prime shipping. Charged the headphone completely (until the green light came) and also paired easily with my iPod and also my laptop. But very soon into my hearing experience I started getting pauses between listening to my iTouch. The audio lagged so many times even after a full charge that I was so disgusted and I am returning back this product. Also the ear fit is very uncomfortable and I doubt if anyone can wear this product for 30 mins or more. All in all a very poor product that has disappointed me.
2	Easy to pair and produce decent sound.  Controls are easy to use.  They are fairly comfortable but not so good when wearing glasses.
0	I was very disappointed. This item did not work right out of the retail box. The charge light came on red and never changed to green. The headphones would not power on. I was looking forward to these. I processed a refund (and was grateful for the Amazon process). I will not reorder because I see from other reviewers and from somebody I know that bought the same headphones that the overall product quality is poor and my experience was not uncommon.
2	I sleep fine in any bed with (or without) any pillow.  I never send back dishes at restaurants.  I've never had a bad taxi driver.  I've never cried over a haircut or even withheld a tip.  I'm really not a whiny person.But these headphones sure as hell don't fit my head comfortably.  The earpiece covers my ears at a strange angle.  The plastic bar piece that goes over the ear is bulky and uncomfortable.  The back part that's supposed to hover over your neck is weird fitting and looking.Maybe if I had giant ears that stuck out from my head and pointed forward...
2	I used this moderately about 45 minutes a day M-F for running and they worked awesome for the first couple months now all of a sudden they wouldn't turn on fiddled with that for a while then the pause play button doesn't work now either.  Pretty disappointing that these headphones can't last even 90 days.  They have a one year warranty so I'll return them and hope the next unit works at least a year.
2	These little headphones do sound very good for inexpensive phones good strong bass and clear treble. Being free of connecting wires seems wonderful I must admit. The fit is very comfortable for me also. I was dissapointed that with my new 3rd generation iPod Touch 64 Gb the phones will not advance to the next song or go back to the previous song with the push controls as they are supposed to do. I later found that the issue here is that Apple does not support the S305's particular Bluetooth profile (AVRCP). Neither will my iPod recognize the phones built in microphone for voice recording as a result of this same issue. The phones themselves are great but for anyone expecting to use them with their iPods this is definitely a problem to consider.
0	The Motorola S305 surprisingly does not sound as good as the Kinivo BTH220 (also sold under other names). The Kinivo also consistently had an easier time connecting to my iphone. However the Motorola S305 looks and feels better than the Kinivo and appears to be more durable.I would have given the S305 4 stars but after three months of ownership the + volume button has completely broken. The - button works fine. I experienced a similar problem with another Motorola model but that problem took over a year to manifest. No I did not drop or abuse these headphones. I hardly even used the volume buttons since controlling the volume with my phone is usually sufficient.These headphones are going in the trash.
0	I was excited opening the package. After reading the directions I plugged the unit in to charge and waited and waited and waited.  The unit never charged.  Sent it back. Gave it one star - bad quality control - disappointed.
2	My current Go Blue Beat EXS is running it's course and I was hoping this Motorola s305 would replace it. Though This s305 is lighter and feels nice on my head the sound quality (bass mid treble) is no way as good as my Blue Beat. This is saying alot considering this from a name brand over an off brand. I'm going to give this a try for a week to see if it's worth the keep.
2	My family and I have three of these and they work but there are better products for the money.. This one does not fold up does not fit the ear real well as it uses those foam pads which get hot and sweaty... The Artic Cooling is a better choice for your money... I have both. I use the Artic all the time and it comes with its own case and charging cord. Buy the Artic.
0	The head set band twists in the back and the ear cups separate away from my ears. The band also goes behind the ears and presses into the back of my ears and is very uncomfortable. This one may have been molded really bad. It keeps disconnecting from the phone and the phone is only 2 feet away. Keep shopping around.
2	The sound is great. But forget the microphone. I used the headset with VOIP to call a landline and there was a noticeable delay of at least 2 seconds at both ends. My headset received good sound with the annoying delay and the landline got a delayed tinny voice from me. (Ordinarily my VOIP connection is crystal clear so I don't believe it was the culprit.)
2	I really like these headphones. I am about to buy my fourth pair in two years. They have decent sound quality plenty sufficient for my primary use of listening to audiobooks and podcasts and talking on the phone. Since I am not an audiophile they are okay for music but I prefer to use good headphones for real music. They have very good call quality. They are my go-to bluetooth headphones for most activities and very handy to be able to listen to music and be able to take or make calls.The downside is that the average life of them is six months before they start flaking out and they won't turn on any more. Usually before this happens the light won't go out on them even when they are turned off and they burn through the battery quickly. Yes I am well aware of the battery reset process which usually stops working after three or four months.But I can't be too hard on them since I wear them for exercise and outdoor activities and I sweat a lot so the foam cushions get soaking wet. This is probably why they don't last too long for me since this likely affects the inner electronics and/or battery which is why they have such a short life for me. And it used to make me mad that they gave up the ghost so quickly. But once the price dropped to around $30 I started considering them disposable and a 6 month lifespan was acceptable. I certainly would not pay more than $30 for them though.These headphones also meet two other absolute requirements I have - they sit on top of the ears and don't completely cover it up or stick in my ear like earbuds which would lead to even more sweating - plus I get ear infections when using either one of these. And they charge with any micro-usb cable so can be used with any of the dozen chargers I have lying around at home or work. I really ought to give them five stars for just these features alone since there are very few other headphones that meet these two criteria but with the short life span of them I really can't.Edit 6 months later: Here I am looking for another pair since the ones I have are about to go. But I won't buy them this time since the price has risen to $40 granted that's the price including shipping since I have Prime. But they don't last long enough to justify that cost. So I am off to buy the Inland equivalent of these the ProHT since they _are_ $30 at my local Microcenter. The buttons are not as convenient and it charges with a mini instead of the preferable micro usb but I can't bring myself to spend $40 on disposable headphones.
2	CONS: These headphones HURT to wear. The reason being is there is no padding whatsoever on the part that actually rests on your ears. The best way I can describe it (which you cannot see in the picture) is imagine a long rectangular piece of plastic now fold that in half so you now have a long u-shaped piece of plastic. Now form that piece into the curve shape you see in the picture. Now strap this around your ears with the weight of both sides (granted they are pretty lightweight) supported solely by the tops of your ears. Keep in mind you have a two plastic edges sitting on top of each ear. After about 15 minutes of running I have to take them off. No amount of re-positioning helps. A better design would have made the headband part a solid cylinder so there are no edges or placing a small section of padding on the part that actually rests on the ears.PROS: For the money they sound like you would expect. I have no complaints in that department. For my 2nd Gen IPOD touch the volume works play/pause but the track forward/reverse buttons do not work.All in all I wish I would have gotten something else :(
2	I got this headset because I was tired of using a clunky wired headset that sat on top of my head and I wanted to experiment with wireless headphones.PURPOSE: I want to listen to streaming music on my computer while not disturbing others if I am in my small apartment a coffee shop an airport or anywhere else.PROS:-- An acceptable sound range (nothing amazing like high-end headsets)-- Wireless-- Light to wear-- Don't blare music where others who are nearby can hear it-- Has a microphoneCONS:-- Pairing was not super easy on a computer. Kept dropping and starting up again.-- Distance range is laughable. The signal started to fade when I walked into my apartment's kitchen and completely stopped when I went into the bathroom.  Again I am in a very small apartment. Most times I only need it sitting at the computer but it'd be nice to have tunes playing if I walk away for a minute.-- The music skips a little with short distances (5-10 feet away).  I have a high speed internet connection so that's not the issue.  This means reception can be spotty on the balcony which is literally right next to my computer area.-- The buttons don't work with Windows Media Player or an internet browser playing Pandora (or any other music site).  These downsides aren't obvious after reading the product description because it focuses on cell phone or iPod/iPhone.  Maybe there is a way to rig it up but it would be great if these features were seamless for users (the buttons serve no purpose to me while on my computer).I am not blown away by the headset but being wireless and having a cheap price (1/2 a Logitech headset I was considering and much less than the Beats) allows me to look past the complaints.
2	I bought these for a plane ride about 18 months ago and used them without issue with a couple of iphones (4) an older ipad an fairly new ipod an imac etc. Having no issues with them (turned them on used all the buttons worked OK) on the Apple stuff I didn't think much about them for a while... Even put them aside for about a year... (Hey I moved changed jobs etc.) Eventually I came back across them and wanted to use them with a Gateway T-1628 Vista Sp2 laptop. I'd used them before on an XP machine and they were OK so I thought next. But Oh baby - what a mess! Had to add a bluetooth adapter to the laptop... Fine. Until I tried several... No way to link up with these headphones to use them as I'd been using them with the Apple stuff! Turns out Microsoft took more and more features out of their bluetooth stack until the S305s were limited to Skype-like stuff. Weird! Figured out I could buy some software from [...] (from $20-30) or I could just give up on this particular idea. Yay for Appple and its support of commonsense. The headphones themselves were OK with my imac and phone. Very pleasant actually to just fire them up and go about my business. Sound quality at this price was excellent. Range was the advertised 30 feet or so - even through the walls of the house. Early buyers apparently wanted to use these to exercise. No. These things would soak up water like a sponge and they have several obvious holes in them. But for around the house stuff - light work - these have been fine. If they worked with the PC stuff without additional grief I'd give these a 5 at this price. But they don't... Or won't without too much (my opinion) effort. Kudos for the batteries by the way. After leaving them sitting around for so long I just charged them up again and they've been fine... I've yet to run the battery down since I've started using them again. They just keep working.
0	Poor battery life... it's supposed to be a extended high capacity battery but the life of the battery was just like my REGULAR battery that came with the phone it sucks. DO NOT BUY!!HOW DO I SEND THIS BATTERY BACK !!!!!!!!
2	If you keep your phone in your pocket like I doand have chargers all over the place like I doThen this battery upgrade may not be for you.The phone is heavier and 1/8 inch thicker with the battery and case.Feels like a Treo now or a GPS.The battery now lasts 3 days instead of one.
2	I wanted to make my G1 last as long as possible as it is a great phone. The stock battery was only giving me about 6 hours on a full charge so I bought the extneded battery. It definitely works. I was getting 10 to 12 hours out of it with moderate use (texting and emails). It does make the phone slightly bigger but overall it was worth the extra battery life.***EDIT*** 09/09/2011As of this week the battery stopped holding a charge. For a few days it would not charge about 63% and this morning it said fully charged and when I got to work the battery was down 40%. Bummed that it only worked for a few months.
2	I bought this to throw in the suitcase for a trip.  I wanted something retractable and small...and this seemed to fit the bill. But it sometimes has a mind of its own...PRO:1 compact. Like the fact that the plug folds down and the cord retracts into the unit.CON:We have Android phones (Samsung and Motorola--both brands stated in the post) and when it is plugged in to charge it does a couple of things.  It started out fine but after about the 6th use it got all weird on me:1 on the Samsung (Galaxy 2) it freezes the main screen and cooks the battery as it charges. And I mean COOK. Like you have just taken a torch to it.  I know that batteries heat when they charge but wow this seemed like it was damaging the phone;2 on the Motorola (Droid X) it turned on my g-Talk screen and sent the weirdest string of letters symbols and numbers as a message---all night long as it charged.  2 different friends woke up to these bizarre messages that were HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of characters long. And the phone wasn't even ON! I always turn the phone off (granted not to 'power off' mode) when I plug the phone in to charge.  It also cooks the battery.3 it doesn't charge everything with a micro USB--thought it would charge my Nook and Kindle but it won't.Not sure about this one to be honest.  I think as it ages it gets funky.  It concerns me of the heat it generates in the phone batteries...maybe opting out of convenience and just getting another charger for the phones would be the best thing.  The phones and/or batteries are far more expensive to replace than the cost of this 'convenience charger'.  Maybe for a first use or a very short use it would be fine but I'm guessing that it has a short shelf life.I won't be buying another.
0	Used this device successfully for about two weeks before the prongs broke off the end that attaches to the phone. And unfortunately I am a couple of days passed the return period so I am out of luck. Buyer beware! Thankfully it was only $5.
0	It is supposed to have an auto shut-off when the phone reaches its full charge. I plugged it in at night and my phone showed it was charging and then went to bed. The next morning my phone was dead. It had lost 30% charge overnight not charging. The next night I plug it in with this charger and it doesn't work! Total garbage. And I bought two of them no less! Maybe the other one will work? I'm not holding my breath.
2	I bought this while I had the Droid 2 and it worked great compact to fit in my purse. However it wasn't powerful enough when I upgraded to the Droid Razr M.
2	Worked good but it broke after a few uses. The cable would not communicate to computer (ertracted ok). I like to praticality.
2	This item took a week to arrive (not too long). In the mean time I received the phone and was anxious to change the sim card and begin using the phone. It was just as easy to use a paperclip to pop the sim card holder open as it is to use this little device...
0	The tool does the job but it is not the original sim card tray tool by Apple. It is a cheap cutout. Do not buy if you want the original one by Apple. If you don't care to scratch the aluminum coating on the phone by inserting this tool into your phone then buy it. If you want to keep your phone in pristine beautiful condition don't waste your time with this cheap product.
0	This pin is super fragile! Forget about it being metal and all. Once I entered it to the sim card area to remove the sim card tray that thing just snapped! It's a complete waste of money and time!
2	While this is a great piece it is not worth the money. You are best off using a paperclip and the results are the same.
2	it did it's job. even though later on figure out i could do the same with a thumb tag.  by then I already ordered it and didn't want to bother with the return.the item was shipped from China so if you guys should get it as a backup for incase you need it.  don't count on the delivery if you need it ASAP (use a thumb tag)
0	the iphone pin I recived was bent all up.When i got the pin it was hanging outside the package.The package was open with many holes in it.
2	Nothing more than a glorified paper clip but it's only 60 cents so i just added it to my order.  Save some money and use a paper clip.
2	The screen protector is slightly larger than my enV touch. I had to cut ever so slightly the edges so it fits without bubbles. If the cutting is done carefully the protector is actually nice and becomes easier to install.
2	Fit the phone very well.  They appear to be very durable.  Six months later and no permanent scratches and I work in a rather dirty environment.  Used in combination with rubberized grip cover and the phone is still in excellent condition.
2	Received promptly. As others have noted plastic smoother not included but credit card works fine. Protectors are cut slightly larger than size of screen area to be covered resulting in bubbles near edges that can not be removed. Bubbles are also difficult to remove from central areas if protector is not carefully applied. Directions are ok and give good guidance in application technique. Bubbles and other imperfections are generally not visible when display is illuminated but really stand out when back light is off. Protector seems reasonably thick and performs intended function. Overall not a bad product. Will probably continue to use for exterior screen which receives the most abuse.
0	The LG enV touch is an awful phone. The accessories work but it's just such an awful phone everything that goes with it deserves a one star rating.
0	As soon as I plugged this charger in the wall it made a spark. Thank God I didn't blow up but something could've happened to my phone. This charger is dead!
2	You get what you pay for....as always.  This product works well for the price you just have to be gentle with it or it will not last too long.
2	Im not a fan...i run outside & it always falls down & I cant wear it with my sunglasses...It does work great as far as the bluetooth & the sound all work correctly
0	It worked (past tense) good for a while (not perfect but good enough to deserve an A-)The buttons were great. The comfort was very good. The sound was good enough to get me through my workouts (I'm no sound pro).At the 6 month mark the device kept beeping as if I were holding down the volume up key. Yes I turned it off & on reset it etc. I turned it off and left it alone for a few hours. It stopped doing it for a little while (about 20 min) and then started again. Every time I used it there after it would start beeping incessantly after a short unknown time interval.When you read the reviews on this item take note of how long the person has owned the device. I do p90x workouts so I frequently sweat quite a bit. I wipe the device off when finished. Item has never been submerged etc. This device in my books is only sweat proof for about 6 months.Judging from the reviews of the s10-hd it's an undesirable product. People who owned the S9 and went to the s10 said it was worse in almost all ways. Based on my experience with Motorola support on this device I want nothing to do with them or their products.Support has been pretty bad. I attempted to do it online and thought I was making headway.The rep chat ended by telling me they'd be emailing me further directions to mail it in (after attaching the receipt to the chat).An email did arrive requesting the receipt again. I replied and gave the receipt. No response from them.Emailed another response with the receipt attached. No response.Did another online chat and jumped through hoops of questioning again. At the end of it the rep told me to call Motorola gave a phone and case number.Called them. After being on hold for quite a long time talked to an agent (who put me on hold a few times) and they said they'd be emailing me directions for sending it in. That's where it is.It's taking me hours to resolve something that could have been resolved in 10-30 minutes.Why can't they resolve this with one agent one session?
2	Bought from Verizon store about 2 years ago.  Had been working great then suddenly I could hardly hear music through the left ear..then not at all.  Then it wouldn't stay synced to my LG EnV Touch..rendering it totally worthless after paying well over $70 for it at the time.  Very disappointing.  It seems these Bluetooth devices don't last very long.  Maybe I should be happy I got 2 years after looking at some of the reviews for any Bluetooth music player/hands-free mic device.
0	This headset has no mic and the sound quality is very average however for the price it's not a bad deal.
2	I was so happy with the first set I ordered from Amazon that I ordered the second set. Unfortunately the quality of the product and sound of this set are not same as the first one.
0	I'd give 0 stars if I could - these arrived dead - I plug them in and all they do is make a lot of scratching sounds no sound comes out and people can't hear me (mic issue too).Can't recommend.
2	I bought these and later picked up the Samsung earphone + mic for $4 and change. These are pretty good and the mic worked fine. But the Samsungs are amazing and cost a whole $2 more.
2	I bought these based on the glowing reviews and except for one key feature they are fine. That key feature is the size of the ear buds but I'll come back to that.I was looking for a durable reasonably priced headphone option and I found it. The average lifespan of my headphones is something like 2 months and I've had these for at least three and they're holding up well. I've received no complaints about sound quality when I use these on conference calls from my cell so I assume that's a good thing.Back to my one and only complaint - the size of the actual ear buds. I must have smaller ears because these do not fit in my ears comfortably at all. They either fall out feel like they're on the verge of falling out or are so loosely in there I can't hear the sound coming from them properly. I've never had an issue like this before and am really disappointed because otherwise these are great.If you use the smaller sizes of the rubber bud that most headphones come with you may want to think twice before buying these.
2	Not sure what people are raving about.  The sound is decidedly low end and the ear buds run small--like they were made for small women or children.  I cannot get good bass response from these as a result.  Still the price is low so I can't complain too much.  Fair is fair.
2	I love the idea of this thing because I don't like fiddling with the cover over my phone's charger port which lost its magnet and stopped snapping back into place after a while. The Touchstone allows me to bypass this.However it seems like this thing will either stop charging my cell phone (Palm Pixi; I don't know if that matters) or outright start draining its battery. The battery is always at exactly 83% capacity when I wake up to it even though it was previously at 100% earlier in the night.It would irritate me more if I didn't have a car charger for my phone.+++++Update on 10/24/11:I have bought several of these now so I don't have to keep moving the dock with me from one room to another when I want to charge. Three out of the four I've owned all stop charging at 83% no matter how long I leave it on. Two of those don't make it to 100% at any point either. The icon says that the phone is charging though.+++++Update on 11/23/11:This charging issue seems to be a combination of both the dock and the wire used. I've swapped out wires for some of the docks and my phone now charges to 100% on them. On the other hand swapping the wire out didn't fix the other dock although the wire plugged directly into my phone will give a 100% charge.
2	This wireless charger works with the Palm equiped devices this doesn't work with Qi standard devices. It works fine with the latest smartphones with special battery door.
0	Palm dies and all of these licked its wounds and dies with the Palm I don't think any other phone compary tried to do this even though it was a cool concept. But the damn cover would always peel in few months so good they are gone !
0	It didn't work.  I tried and tired and tired to get it to work with no luck.  Dont waist your money.
2	You have to position it just so or it won't charge.  If it gets bumped the slightest bit it stops charging.  Also when the battery is fully charged the Palm seems to go into a cycle every minute of starting charging (and the Palm beeps) then finishes then starts again...It also gets quite warm which I guess should be expected for an inductive charger.
0	The charger dock requires additional pieces in order for it to function...Not sure I'll ever use it. Consider the required replacement back for the pixi is cheap and fails to meet the quality of the phone.
0	I purchased this charging dock went throught receiving the wrong product and having to wait to receive the correct item at a later date. After all was said and done the dock does not work. I have half a mind to think the seller sent me a faulty dock because I complained about receiving the incorrect propduct to begin with. Really frustrated at this point. Not going to bother complaining again as it has gotten me nowhere. UGH!! I hope this seller enjoys my donation...
0	I got this for my SGS3. I picked up the Samsung back cover on e bay....this works fine with it but the phone(with out a case on) barely stays in place. You have to get it just right for it to start charging and it is very touchy...u move it the slightest it stops working. The sloped design of this thing is makes it more difficult than a flat surface.O did I mention it won't work with even a slim rubber case on the phone. I have this case:GreatShield Guardian S Series Slim-Fit S-Line Design TPU Case for Samsung Galaxy S3 - BlackMight as well just plug the phone in if I have to go through the hassle of removing my case.I assumed that this would come with the cable and wall plug you need to actually use it....but no...this is the DOCK ONLY! (the seller has since added this info into the title of the listing)You must have a micro usb cable with a very thin head because the tunnel in the back of this dock that the cord goes in is very narrow. Lucky one of my older Samsung phones cable was small enough....and I have my own usb charger....but no indicator lights on the dock...I found a much better solution:Qi wireless Charger receiver pad for Samsung Galaxy S3 S9300Nokia DT-900 Wireless Charging Plate - Retail Packaging - RedI can confirm that these 2 products work perfectly with my slim case on the phone. The Nokia pad is a tad smaller than the S3 but it sit on there much better than the palm touchstone.
2	This device was wonderful while it worked!.  It quit after about 9 months.  It might be the special back required for the phone to be able to use this charger but after multiple switching around of cords I believe it is the charger that failed.  This is after all a type of transformer to change AC current to DC and I think something in the device failed.
2	I had no chance to use it because it is the charging dock only! It comes with no USB cable whereas I found most USB cable will be too big to insert in the dock.
0	Plugged it in and did not work. Did not bother trying to figure out which from the shipment was broken (i.e. stone or back). I'm sure it would have been great had it worked.
2	If you have this phone I would just stick with the basic charger.  I thought this would be cool and easy but the phone always slips off the touchstone.  It is a cool idea......just needs some refining!
2	First off let me say that for under $5 this really is a great value and I definitely recommend it to anyone. Upon getting it installed I immediately calibrated the battery using the Dr. Battery application and it charged to 1088 mAh (out of 1150 mAh possible - not bad!) I've had it running for 2 days now and everything seems to be working great. I really wanted to give this product at least 4 stars but a couple of issues held me back:1) The Amazon ad lists this as a New product. The battery I received is most definitely a refurbished original Palm battery. It physically looks more worn than the battery I was replacing. But for $5 I'm OK with a refurb. And a refurb that charges up to 1088 mAh is good enough for me. They should just advertise as Refurbished.2) The battery arrived completely discharged. Not one ounce of juice in it. That means that my phone had to be off for at least 15 minutes while it charged up to 5% before the operating system would actually boot.3) The first time I installed the battery the screen showed the big empty battery icon that it gives until the battery reaches 5% so the OS can boot. But instead of getting to 5% and booting about 25 minutes went by and the screen icon changed to a big battery with a question mark in it...then the screen just went off. I was worried that I received a bad battery and thought I would have to return it. But I took the battery out put it back in and the second time it operated properly.But as I said I really do recommend this product. I will probably buy another one for my wife's Pixi. You really can't beat the price.
2	charges works and died
2	this seller is selling junk !!! the battery your looking at must be a D grade unit or the rejects because they charge all the way up then discharge in 14 hours and for some reason get very hot.
2	I like the magnetic flip closure. My biggest complaint is that the clip on part is too tight. It's very hard to get it on my belt. I tried to get used to it but couldn't.
0	I got this thing after I saw it heavily advertised as solid protection for a phone's glass.  I used it and must say that it is no better than the one or two dollar protectors.  It wrinkled was filled with bubbles and gets dirty very easily.  Despite repeated efforts to remove them this thing had more bubbles than a bubble bath.  I would not recommend it plus it's pricey!
0	Don't waste your money on this lifetime replacement as you can get beeter protectors for a lot cheap prices. Most screen protectors usually last the life of the phone anyway.
0	Concept was great but tad heavy in the ears would not stay on. Also it does not work w/ the iPhone-my ears were almost blasted off when I tried them. I am frankly shocked that S/E would make such a cool headset and not have it work w/ many phones especially the iPhone. It may work well for other devices...I cannot determine the possibility.
2	Does not hold a charge for long have to charge it the night before I need it.  No volume control the automatic adjustment works OK but would be nice if I could set it.
0	Nice looking small and light weight.Average sound and over-priced.You CANNOT adjust the volume from a iPod Touch or iPhone. This is a big big minus.I do not recommend this item. There are better choices out there.
2	I absolutely love this battery. I've recently been having problems with my smartphone battery dying by mid-day (long story) while I'm out and about with work. I'm not near a electrical outlet most of the time so I decided to give this battery a shot. I was able to use my phone continuously all day long with it plugged into the battery pack and didn't even drain half of the juice from it. And all of that for less than $50 was a nice bonus.Now the unit isn't perfect. My only gripe with it is that the LED lights displaying it's charge level only illuminate when the battery itself is being charged (while plugged into the wall for example) not while it's charging a device. It would be nice to know how much longer the battery can charge your device. But I was still willing to rate it 5 stars because of how portable it is (fits in a dress shirt pocket). I've very happy with my purchase. I was considering purchasing a similar Energizer unit for about the same price but it was only 5000mAh.Pros:- tremendous amount of charging power- very portable (small for the amount of power it provides)- works with any smartphone that can charge from USB- can charge two devices at once- has a 2.1amp port for charging tablets and phones very fastCons:- battery meter doesn't display how much juice the batter has left while charging your deviceEdited 5/24/2010----------------I'm disappointed to report that the battery has given up the ghost after only a year of light use (used it maybe 20 times for trips). It will still take a charge (battery shows that it's full) but it will no longer charge any other devices. I thought maybe it was a faulty cable but buying another one didn't correct it. And there is absolutely no tech support available anywhere for New Trent products from what I can tell. I was expecting more. Decided to buy a 10000mAh Anker (Anker Astro3E 10000mAh High Capacity Power Bank Pack Portable External Battery Charger for iPhone 5 4S 4iPad 4 3 2 Mini iPods; Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 S2 Note 2; HTC One EVO Thunderbolt Incredible Droid DNA; Motorola ATRIX Droid; Google Nex...]) to replace it.
2	The case itself is nicer than the picture*does the job protecting the iPhone*it is elegant lookingBUT. This why only 2 STARS.The top closure flap has a very STONG Magnet. Usually the magnet is only in the inside to keep caese closedBut this one the magnet is also in the outside  Which could damage other  electronics  specially car keys and remote controlOne more thing. You must remove the front cover to attach the phone USB  Which is not convenient and if one is not careful the top latch can touch the phone and cause mayor damageThe  magnet is so STONG that my teaspoon was attached to my phone caseSo  I can not recommend. And if I could would send it  backI have glued a piece of Velcro  So it will do for a while.  But it does not look as nice
2	This is a nice battery but I am worried about the cords extending from the battery itself. The micro usb cord and usb cord seem stiff and they look like they could snap off with a few uses. They do not twist very easily and they are both in line and tuck into the battery. It would be nice if they had more flexibility. I could use a bit more direction as to what goes where at least a picture or something. Also there is no included wall plug that I would have expected. However if you are looking for a solid backup this will do.
2	I tested his product and plugged in both  an iPhone and an iPad that had each 15%battery life remaining. It charged both only to 75% capacity before it got fully drained. Also the product is fully charged after about 5 hours charging  It doesn't really deliver as it promised.
2	I purchased this because I am simply tired of having literally dozens of old cell phone spare batteries for phones I no longer use lying around.  Plus my new phone (Droid Razr) has a fixed battery like the iPhones do so extra batteries weren't an option.  I occasionally travel long distance by air and needed enough juice to keep my movies and music going for 20 or more hours of heavy usage.  Finally I HATE being half way through a movie when a battery dies and you have to swap the spare--an external battery takes care of that.I purchased this particular model becuase I had a chance to look at the IMP50D.  The IMP50D I received was defective so I decided to go with the IMP70D trading the extra size for for the 40% increase in juice.  As far as build quality goes the unit is very solid and very professional looking.  The USB output port is a little on the loose side but connects and charges just fine.  As for charging the micro USB plug for power in is nice as it is the same plug my phone uses.Keep in mind I originally bought this for air travel.  Since getting my new phone and playing with it way too much I've found this charger has been a life saver when I get a late afternoon or evening call.  If the battery is burnt down I can quickly grab the IMP70D plug it in and take the call.  HOWEVER...The IMP70D should have enough juice to fully charge my Razr at least 3 times if not more.  I have been able to reproduce this problem:  Either the battery pack  does not have the advertised capacity or it is unable to hold a charge.  I should be able to fully charge my 1780mAh cell phone battery fully at least 3 if not more times.  I am averaging less than two.  To make matters worse after one charge the LED indicator will show the pack has 3 out of 4 LEDs indicating a decent charge.  I check this by briefly turning the pack on then making sure it is shut off.  The very next use I ended up with one blinking LED--indicating the pack was exhausted.  I had the exact same issue with the IMP-50D in that it died after one full recharge well short of the stated capacity.For the size the awkwardness of the product I was expecting something that did what it is supposed to.  I am only giving this two stars because I got it on sale and it does work somewhat.  But this is one heck of a brick to carry around and only get 1.5-2 charges out of.
2	Good battery pack for traveling but recently something broke inside and it rattles which worries me so it stays in home as a backup charger when the energy services get interrupted and I still fully cycle it each month just for fun.
2	the good:it connected to my phone so easily and quickly!the USB cord is good (especially since I somehow lost the AC cord 3 days after I got it)the plug is the same as my Motorola phone so I can use my same car charger (also good since I lost my AC adapter)the directions are very easy-I have a Plantronic which is good but the directions are so silly to remember I have to carry the manual around)it is lightweight and comfortablethe lights are a good ideathe bad:it is a bit too lightweight and feels flimsythe use time is way shorter than my Plantronicthe ugly:the plug is very hard to put the cords in and out and I'm afraid it will snap off
2	Large ear piece did not fit in my ear. Very uncomfortable. Had a difficult time pairing this item with my phone. Recommend that you keep looking.
2	The price is good it is easy to set-up and very user friendly. It is not very comfortable to wear so I do not recommend it to those people who wear their headsets all the time.One major flaw that I found (maybe it's true for all bluetooth headsets have not tried others) is that when using it on my computer to make phone calls on Skype it interferes with my other bluetooth devices such as my Logitech V470 mouse. Hopefully there would be a firmware update to fix this issue.
0	This antenna will not work with the Virgin Mobile WiFi even though it says it will work with all cellular networks. The Virgin mobile device has the antenna outputs on the Sierra Wireless but an external antenna it is not supported. The only thing you can use is a cradle that they sell as far as I have been able to find out.I paid an exorbitant amount for shipping from this seller and ended up returning it and had to pay for more shipping. I lost $$ on the deal and it didn't work. I am sticking with Amazon Prime on everything from now on.
2	My goal is to find the smallest Bluetooth headset I can find.  This one was dirt cheap and small so I thought I'd give it a try.  Here are my thoughts:Pros:Small and lightSwitch to turn it on/offCons:Sound compared to my previous headset (jabra) is tinny and quite.  Sometimes I couldn't turn it loud enough to hear over ambient noise.Falls out of my ear constantly.  I have small ears so you would think it would be easy to find a headset that stays in but no.  I guess I'm going to need one that has the neoprene inserts.  This one just has a speaker insert that doesn't help it stay in the ear.The over ear loop is hard plastic and tends to hurt after a while.For the price it works but my old headset sounded a lot better.
2	For the price this is a great device but I'd pay another $10 for a better earpiece for this thing or some spares in the box when the sell it to you.It's synchs quickly with the iPhone 3Gs and holds a charge all day long - as many as three hours of talk time for me during the day.  Recharges quickly.  Easy to use.  Very good call quality.  Light.But the earpiece is a piece of crap. Snapped off pretty easily soon after I bought it so I had to tape the flimsy plastic earpiece together so I could get some use out of it but it looks silly.If you have another $20 to spend maybe even just another $10 you could get same quality but better earpiece even better looking.  This could be a five star device if they had just asked a half-smart monkey to design the plastic ear hook better.---Recently bought a Plantronics bluetooth for about $40 that is heads and shoulders above this one in build quality.  Obvious when I opened the box that they did find a half-smart monkey or at least a decent engineer to design the earpiece which is thicker and connected to the actual device better.  I rely on my earpiece too much to have one that breaks unnecessarily.
0	I dont know what happened to mine but it got a crack in it and the plastic disinegrated on me after about 6 hours of use out in the sun.  Also it was very uncomfortable my ears hurt for a day afterwards after wearing it for that long.
2	The product is fine. I just hate it when rinky dink sellers advertise cheap products one way then disregard their descritption and what was actually ordered - just sending you whatever they have lying around. I ordered 1 White and 2 Black cables. I chose this seller because they supposedly had the cables in black. They sent me 3 White ones along with the packing slip that showed my correct 1WH/2BL order. They know 99% of the time you wont return it because it only costs a buck or two.
2	It works but I have a new-style Apple bumper on my iPhone and a silicone case on my iPod. I have to take the cases off of both to get this cord to plug in.
2	Bought this mostly for in-line control features to control my Bold 9700 when it's holstered.  The complaints that I have with this headphones is mostly the lack of bass and that the lapel clip keeps coming off.  Before this I was using the Sony h.ear earphones with my Bold 9700 to listen to the music stored which which to me was not a high baseline of comparison.  The call quality is ok but I wish RIM fixes the ringing issue on all their Blackberry devices when using any headset and not just mutes the music if an incoming call comes in which causes miscalls.The other accessories are a plus especially the case but I haven't had the need to swap out the other parts that came with it.  The right-angle connector is again a plus but feels that it sticks out farther than I'm accustomed to.  The gun-metal highlights on the headphones are a plus.  Also wish Amazon noted down that it's in an OEM packaging.
0	This product claimed it was a charger for iPhone 3gs. However it was not compatible with the phone because it did not work at all!
0	The price is great the delivery was o.k.  Everything was adequate. Just one small problem the plug was just a fraction too wide to fit into my 32GB 3GS. Even if you squeeze the insert pins it just does not fit. Too cheap to do anything with so it goes to the landfill.
0	This case was TERRIBLE!Very flimsy very pretty very useless.  I was glad that I paid next to nothing for it because it was one of the cases that made me the most unhappy.  I am not a fan of cases that cover any amount of the front of the phone.  While this didn't cover too much of it the poor construction wouldn't allow the case to actually snap closed around the phone.  I'm not sure if it was broken in shipping or production but by the time it got to the end user the product was useless.
2	WHEN I GOT THIS PRODUCT  THOUGHT SOMETHING FELT WIERD ABOUT THE CASE. THEN I FOUND THAT THE PATTGERN EASLY RUBBS OF IN YOUR POCKETS! BUT I DONT MIND I STILL LIKE THE CASE.
0	Pretty phone caes however the paint started peeling within the first two weeks of owning it.  Basically you get what you pay for.
2	The fit was great very lightweight and comfortable. But it stopped working after a couple of months. I have been through so many of these that I'm going to have to go backed to wired and I hate that.
2	I received the unit and successfully paired it with my iPad. However when I went to pair it with my iPhone or computer I could no longer get it into pairing mode.  I tried many times with no success.  I emailed their support through their online form but have not received and answer yet.  The phone number listed on their site doesn't work for me I've gotten various bizarre no service type messages.  So I'm kinda stuck because I really like the sound quality and it works great on my iPad still but I cannot use it with any other devices.ProsComfortableVery good sound qualityLong battery lifeRange is good (25 ft. easy for me)ConsSupport is non-existent.
2	These screens are real easy to trim down and apply to your phone/device.  The grid pattern makes it simple to trim down.  The product detail listed however is not completely accurate.The actual dimensions of the screen protectors supplied are : 3.0625&#34; - width x 4.25&#34; - heightA little too short to fit my smart phone completely but it covers the majority and will work.
2	I put it on a couple of Samsung cellphones and a digital camera screen and the stuff didn't stay on for all that long.  I never have tried the stuff again but I will give it a second chance.
2	I dont lie i like it and the only problem is that I have to replace the double tape it has to put it firmly on my car.  Have to with the first one and the second just fall minutes after installation.
0	I have purchased a similar item. Was hoping this would be the same. But no luck. I wanted it to hold my iphone in the car. It is not strong enough. the Other item I purchased was strong enough to hold with the metal piece even under the case. But this one is not even strong enough to hold the phone on its own. I should of returned it as soon as I got it. Very disappointed i ordered the wrong one!.
0	What a piece of crap!!!!!  Magnet could barely hold a pencil let alone a heavy iphone 5.  If I could rate this product a half star that would be touch much credit.  Do not purchase this product.
2	The product is useless. It's so tiny for big size phone.I don't even know how this works. The metal plate is too thick to put inside of phone case and the power of magnet is too weak.Didn't want to bother return it only because it's a few bucks.
2	This tool is OK but it could be betterHaving just one pry tool is almost like a fetterBecause it almost died on me and I would be out of luckSo thankfully I fixed my phone before I got stuckThe screwdrivers are fine but it's the blue prying tool that is the limiting factor given that you only get one. the tip is thin as it should be but because of that it's flimsy and therefore if you work on the device hard with the tool it starts bending and the thin edge starts to wear away.  If it died completely then I'd be out of luck.  It'd be better if it came with three.
0	The T5 screwdriver did no work at all.  It was as if the screw I was trying to turn was completely rounded but it wasn't.  So I bought a much higher quality brand and it worked no problem.  The screwdrivers are complete junk so don't waste your money.  The plastic tool did work okay but it's basically ruined after one use.
2	Not a good quality set but it worked. I would suggest to pay a little more and go for the quality
0	product is of very deficient quality the screwdrivers didn't last the first screw before the heads got damaged it was a cheap product and a waste of money as wellDONT BUY IT!!!!!
2	The drivers are small but well made.  They worked for the job I originally purchased them for.The plastic pry guide is useless.  The edge snapped off on the first attempted use.
0	Rather worthless A torx driver too small to fit anything on &#34;most of phone&#34; a tiny phillips driver that's totally useless on &#34;most of phone&#34; a guitar pick (really!!) two plastic prybars that might have a use and a suction cup with a keyring attached.
2	Ordered these tools from The OEM Planet. Received only one plastic pry-opener as advertised at the time of the purchase. Used them to replace side rails on BlackBerry Curve 8320. Having read the reviews about poor quality of these tools I had to be very careful not to damage the tips on all of them. The tools were indeed of very poor quality but they did the job. I consider this a good value for a dollar. Perhaps they may last through one more repair. Treat these tools as disposable.
2	used this product to disassemble a blackberry and after its use the pry tools where practically destroyed....scredrivers are solid but the pry tools seem like they are not a quality product.would consider another tool if planning to disassemble various phones with it
2	The delivery time was great but the quality of the item was not. On the first use the blue one was bent and could not be used anymore. The others were ok when I first got them but now one is totally worn out.
0	I did this as an add on to some things that I was buying for my phone. When I say it I thought it would be good to have in case I every needed to get into repairing my phone in a major way. Put the order in got an email saying it has shipped and 6 weeks later still no tool I also didn't receive another part of the group of things that I ordered so I would not recommend this or the seller ever at this time.
0	It would be wiser to spend just a little more money and get a good and sturdy stylus. I don't recommend.
0	i don't really hate this at all and i am sure it will be a great deal. but i haven't  received it yet.  i am looking forward to receiving it
0	These styli will not work on a matte anti glare screen protector. I like to protect all my electronics with a screen protector and these styli DO NOT WORK on a screen protector. I have not tried them on a glossy screen protector. The tips are very cheap to touch and they are worth the amount I bought them for and nothing more. I felt like I just thew three bucks into the toilet and flushed it down. Do yourself a favor and get a better stylus by paying a little more. I guess I was just greedy when I thought I was getting 3 great styli for a cheap buck and a half.
2	i guess for this price they are ok..very light weight and cheaply made..if you push too hard the metal from the pen will scratch the phone..would rather pay more for higher quality..but all in all  guess they match the price I paid
2	Got here quick but the tips didn't work well through my otter box case and had to glue tips in as they kept falling off
2	THESE ARE CUTE AND INEXPENSIVE BUT NOT REALLY FEASIBLE...THEY SHOULD ATLEAST HAVE A CLIP ATTACHED SO THEYRE HARD TO LOSE N EASY TO CARRY AROUND...THEY WORK REALLY WELL THOUGH!
2	Got this for my GPS for my motorcycle (tight on space). It died a few months after I got it and I contacted Belkin for a replacement (outside Amazon's return window). Got the RMA sent it in and a new one showed up. Can't complain as most stuff from China has a 50%+ failure rate anyways. Its really compact but doesn't stay in my lighter socket very good. The Kensington K33497US I have stays in much better. If I get another I'll probably go with the Kensington one but it isn't as compact.
0	I used one to power my Sandisk Sansa E280.  It failed within two days--less than two hours of use.  I sent it back and got another which failed again within two days.  What a piece of junk.  The Sansa doesn't even draw that much power and my old non-low-profile has powered it for years.
0	Bought this to pack in my travel bag for use in rental cars because of how small it is.  But I must say it is nearly impossible to remove.  I installed it in a Hertz rental a Mazda 3 series I think and it was nearly impossible to get out.  Working at it with the car key at an angle and turning pulling turning pulling I managed to get it out after about 5 minutes of work and some scraped knuckles.  I think this is probably great for a permanent install in your own vehicle (though you might not care how small it is then and of course there are 2-port high power chargers that are almost as small you might want instead).  For travel its a bust.
2	Micro auto chargers commonly don't maintain good contact with cigarette lighter socket. this one is no exception. i have to check the indicator light frequently to ensure my device is being charged. Consider its high price i do not recommend this unit.
0	Recommend that no one buy this product that was made in China.Now I know why it only cost me $0.01 even though shipping cost me $4.28.I only used it once and it didn't even charge my phone; instead it drained my phone's battery.Worst of all  the device smells like a burnt electrical wire.  It was very hot to the touch when I unplugged it.It is quite possible that if I left the device plugged in longer it would have started a fire.Now I have to start looking for another one one that won't burn up with one use.And one that will actually charge my phone battery.If shipping charges were refundable I would return the defective device.
0	I purchased this from AlernativeWireles.com for my Motorola Droid 2 Global.  I could barely get the phone in & out.  Wayyyy too tight.  The second time I extricated the phone all the stitches on the side ripped.  Very poor quality and does not fit Droid 2 Global as stated in description.
2	This is the ultimate in  geekware.  Case is nice secure but too big for anyones belt.  If you have love handles (muffin top) then this case will be a hassle.  It just not anatomically correct.  I don't have that problem but the case is still too big.  Its like a fanny case for your phone
2	I'm not sure if the seller is aware that the material is not leather; I found out the hard way when I used a lighter to burn off some loose thread.  Despite the false description I'm not completely disappointed with this purchase.  I've looked at quite a few case with similar style and the reason I chose this one is: it covers the corners the flap is smaller than some of the ones I considered and the over all look is simple but elegant.  Would I have made the purchase even if I knew it wasn't leather?  As long as it's under ten dollars (including shipping).  FYI it is very roomy for my 4th gen iPod Touch before I put a shell on it but now it fits perfectly--just snug enough that the iPod won't slip out.
2	this is a very low quality and chargers very slowly. the fuse soon pooped and it' snot working anymore. so nothing about it premium deluxe or rapid
2	It is a P.O.S. Don't waste your money. I gave it 2 stars because it had a pretty design. That is all it is good for.
0	This is a very pretty cover and seems to be decent quality for the price. I like the fact that is has sort of a &#34;suede&#34; type feel to the outside so you won't drop it very easily. However it doesn't fit my Verizon iPhone at all- too small. Keep looking if you have that phone so you won't be disappointed. I will toss this one as it isn't worth bothering to return it.
2	I have an iPhone 4 and it does not fit. The phone is too thick and is not rounded in the back like the case is. Also when I got the case there was a slight chip in the corner where the two pieces fit together. It was shipped to me fairly quickly and I got it well within the estimated time. I will consider buying from them again however I will be more careful to read the product description
0	So very disappointed.  The item arrived with one of its corners already broken (missing a piece of it which was not in the package).  The cover is actually thick it's not slick as it seems to be in the picture.  It's made of a cheap material and makes the iPhone so much larger than what it is without this cover.  In fact I believe that if it falls down the cover will click open and will not protect the phone at all so what's the point?  Look for something else!
2	it a decent product . after you put everything u want in it it is hard to close. you might just have to put the key items like credit/debit/license etc cards cuz that as much that u might fit and still have it close
2	My son did not care for this. I believe it was too much for him. Overall the case itself is good but we don't use it.
2	A clip brok off within the first week I had it on. Useless after that since it won't stay closed. You get what you pay for. It was pretty while I had it.
2	I have mixed feelings about this particular case. The look and feel of the case it self is quite nice. I love the appeal and the good grip it has since I'm a butter fingers when it comes to phones; although I wouldn't recommend it to people who drop their phones a lot or place their phones down roughly or anything like that. The case it self is strong enough to protect from small falls but the case it self would break or fall apart if dropped from your pocket or onto a hard surface. If you don't have problems with dropping your phone a lot this case isn't that bad and can do it's job if taken care of but if not I suggest a different case. :/ I have mixed feelings about this particular case.
2	I am bummed because this case was super cute and I really liked it but it fell like a foot and a half and broke and would nolt snap back together. I only had like two weeks.
0	I didn't like this case at all but sold it on FB to try to get my money back sorry.
0	Do not buy! It wouldn't fit on my phone at all. Just a waste of money since you can't use it.
2	I loved the all over protection of this phone case only thing is that the first time I dropped my phone it broke and my phone got scratched
0	It worked for a couple days before starting to go in and out then I noticed the smell of smoke. I unplugged it immediately and threw it in the trash. Don't buy this product it's a possible fire hazard. Glad I didnt have it plugged in at night while I was asleep or while I was out it could have caught on fire!
0	I don't think this was constructed to actually charge 2 items at once.  Just because it has the 2 usb slots doesn't mean it can tolerate the juice.  My gave out soon after purchase.
0	Charger will charge a tablet and something small but not an S4 and Galaxy Tab 2 10. It will charge one or the other but for that I have the chargers that came with my devices...Overall: If you have small older devices then this will probably work for you otherwise pay more money for enough ampage.
2	Works fine as an Ipod charger. I had hoped it might work for my Motorola V9M phone as well.  But no the phone says incompatible charger.  But no harm done.
2	I would suggest not buying this.  It doesn't supply a good amount of power to two devices.  I would spend the extra to get one that does.
2	My wife and I have been using this behind our bed for a couple years now to charge our phones.It seems to work but I have burned through 2 of them where they just quit charging altogether.If you think about it though with how cheap they are I'm still coming out ahead so I'm not that upset about it.
2	works really well just like advertised and whatnot. however it does not charge an iphone and ipad all through the night. I fall asleep so I dont know what happens but they just don't.
2	They do what they're supposed to do. I ordered 3 of them in Nov '09 I still use two of them. The third one is in a drawer and it does work fine but it emits an audible whine when plugged in. They were cheaper when I bought them so it doesn't seem like as much of a steal these days but at the right price they're not a bad choice. Obviously they're not going to charge devices which require more than 500mA draw but for older and newer low-current devices they'll work just fine.
0	I thought it was great I didn't even use both ports but then after two days of using...it didn't work anymore.Seller: Importer520
2	I wanted to use this device to charge an ipad and an iphone at the same time.  It could only charge one of those at a time.  There are better chargers out there that can do both.  I used this one:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0091XIUKY/ref=oh_details_o07_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc;=1
2	I bought this for traveling to charge two phones. At first it would work with my iPhone & old work flip phone- IF I plugged the iPhone in first. It would not work with two iPhones. Now about a year later it hums- makes a constant buzzing noise even with only one phone plugged in. But t was cheap so o well.
2	does the job but is a little bulky and so far I haven't had any problems with it chargering
2	Very bulky I have since replaced this with a 4-pot model that is less bulky. Not sure why you need to take up so much space just for two usb plugs.
2	It works but when you plug in a device it makes a high pitch sound that can get annoying especially if the charger is next to you at night.
0	This item failed on first use. When I opened it up (I'm an electrical engineer... I had to open it didn't I?) I found a decent circuit board average components and the worst soldering job ever. What failed? The wires that were soldered to the back of the steel plug blades were cold soldered and came apart. Plus the blades were held in place with a friction fit which also failed leaving exposed metal in the socket when the plug came apart. Construction is so bad that I estimate that the electrical integrity is likely just as bad and may actually harm delicate electronics like cell phones. Be careful and avoid this one!!!!
2	I have one of these chargers that I got at an AT&T; corporate store and one that I bought here from the Marketplace seller 11thstreetwireless so I can do a side-by-side comparison.Buying here the charger did not arrive in retail packaging although it is AT&T; branded. It came in a plastic baggie that was taped shut with a barcode sticker.The charger itself works and feels just like the one from AT&T; - which is to say: it charges my iPhone 4 as I'd expect it to and using any USB-powered audio device with the additional USB port will carry alternator noise (a buzzing sound that ebbs and flows with the speed of your engine basically).I can't say that the charger I received had obvious signs of being previously used but I wouldn't be at all surprised if it was refurbished rather than something new that just wasn't in retail packaging.Overall it does what it's supposed to. The construction isn't particularly good - certainly not as good as the (admittedly more expensive)Digital Lifestyle Outfitters DLZ9554317  Auto Charger for iPod & iPhone (Black). For the price you probably can't do much better. But it might be worth an extra few dollars to get something nicer.
2	Fair car charger for my 3GS. Nice extendable cord.It charges iPhone 4 and 3GS correctly BUT the USB port doesn't work.
0	My phone crashes constantly with this battery.When I tried to get a replacement seidio gave me the runaround and has refused to issue an RMA.  My last two emails have been ignored.
0	The cover and battery came new as listed however once I inserted the replacement battery and tried to put on the cover that came with it I immediately started having problems. First of all the battery cover wont properly latch into the phone and from time to time it will actually come off. Second thing I noticed was the battery life of my Palm Pre Plus Was only ever so slightly extended and I mean it when I say it was hardly noticeable.For the extra bulk it makes that in its self is not worth the extra 30 minutes of talk time it gives. But the major problem I have over all other problems I listed is that the replacement battery charges poorly to say the least. Not only does it take forever to charge when not in use but when I use the Mobile Hotspot feature on my Palm Pre Plus it drains the battery extremely fast. So upon realizing this I started plugging my phone into my home charger however I found that even when it is plugged in the battery still drains!I have sense boxed the big bulky worthless battery bought some car chargers and switched back to the original battery and cover. Spend the extra money on a better quality battery I wish I had!!!
0	UPDATE: I found a method at precentral to determine the actual battery capacity as identified by the manufacturer. It turns out this battery only has a capacity of 2300mAh and I am feeling very ripped off. I also have another battery from this brand and it is also showing itself to be mislabeled. I will be complaining to Siedio and posting back here if/when they make it right.It still gives me much better life than my standard battery but if they continue to mislabel them I am forced to recommend the other brands available on Amazon and not anything from Siedio. This explains why I was barely getting twice the life when I should be getting at least 2.3x Grrrr.I love my Pre+. No one does contacts and calendar better than Palm. No one ever has no one is now and perhaps no one ever will. But the Pre uses the same battery as the Centro and battery life is terrible. I spent my first day doing nothing but internet and appstore stuff and I got about 5 hours of life from the stock battery. Palm should be ashamed of that - I get a lot more than 5 hours from my notebook PC!So this is about 2.3 times the capacity of the standard battery so it should get you through until evening before you need a recharge. If you don't use it for more than a phone you should be able to talk for a week on one charge.This is a great choice if you just want capacity. It comes with a nicely finished back cover that is actually easier to take off or put on than the stock cover.Two problems that you should consider:1) It doesn't work with the Touchstone charger. I didn't think that would be a problem because I didn't even buy one. Then I tried the Touchstone. They are the coolest thing ever. Sure the wireless charging and intelligent behavior changes when it is on the Touchstone are nice. But I'm impressed because I can stick in on my dashboard or console and I have the equivalent of a car kit. So much better than having it slide around or having to look down to dial. I've ordered the smaller Seidio 1350MAh battery that fits in the standard cover so I can have 17% more battery and use the Touchstone when I'm on those long drives. I would give this battery 5 stars if they had an option for a Touchstone back plate. I'd be willing to pay $25-$30 for it too. Hopefully there is no technical reason why they can't make that for this battery. If you don't care about Touchstone support this wont bother you.2) It makes your phone much thicker. Not a problem for me and it actually makes it easier to type on the keyboard. But it goes from being Droid thin to 3/4 thick. That's thicker than the 1st-generation iPod and about 50% thicker than a Blackberry Curve. If you are looking for razor thin you need a battery that works with the stock cover. If you only care about long life this this is great.There are other batteries that are even bigger but they are more than twice the price. This hits the right mix of capacity and size for those that can live with a thicker phone. If those two items don't bother you this is a great battery for you and at a great price.Oh several have mentioned problems with being loose fitting. That has apparently solved because this fits as well as the stock battery. You should ignore those complaints.
2	I've had this battery for 5-6 weeks. First let me say yes this battery makes my palm pre much chunkier... but I would rather a chunky phone with a charged battery than a make a fashion statement with a phone that's constantly connected to a charger. After my first charge with the new battery my phone stayed at 100% for hours! It gradually dropped and I charged it on the third day! Unthinkable with my original battery as I was charging it twice a day. Now here's where it gets strange. I plugged the battery in to charge it the first time and it immediately dropped from 12% to 0%. I thought that was strange even disconnected it to see if it would go back up to 12% but it stayed at 0%. I didn't have an incident like that again ........ UNTIL NOW. My phone was completely charged 2 nights ago so it was at 100% yesterday morning ... last night it was somewhere around 78% when I went to bed and this morning it was turned off with a 0% charge. Not happy about that. Especially since I just threw away the original packing. Up until last night I was getting 2 to 3 days out of a charge and was extremely happy.One of the main reasons I bought this battery is we're going on a trip next week and I wanted a reliable battery because I wouldn't be near a charger most of the time. Now I'm worried that my battery will drain in a flash. I may have to pack my spare.SO... had I rated this battery yesterday I would have given it 5 stars but to lose 78% of it's charge overnight definitely made me re-think that rating. 3 stars for my fickle chunky battery.
0	I dont usually get expensive accessories  but I decided to splurge on something nice for my new Palm Pre.Unfortunately you do not get what you pay for  the tabs that hold the case onto the phone broke after a month of regular well cared for use  so now the expensive case does not stay on the phone and is worthless.  Save your money.
0	This case has many 5-star reviews.  I suspect the reviews were written soon after the user got the case put it on the Pre and was impressed with the fit finish the attractive minimalist design matte finish and that it's the only case that still allows you to charge via touchstone.  I give it one star b/c what good is a case that you won't be able to use in a month?One of the main reasons I bought this case is b/c of the high praise from pre cen tral (seemed like everyone's standard case there) and the fact it's touchstone capable. If you have a Sprint Pre you know that the touchstone back is not included unlike the Verizon Pre Plus (edit 5/17/2010: Pre Plus will be avail for AT&T; and it will include touchstone back and the charger! Sprint continues to fail by by selling the original Pre not Pre Plus and without any accessories yet it's still $150 in many cities!). I thought Seidio's back can replace Palm's touchstone back and it was only after I received the package that I discovered that I needed to buy a separate touchstone case (another $20). Side note: these accessories can cost some good change - $26 for Seidio case $35 for touchstone charger and another $20 for touchstone back. This is after having just spent $ 1 30 on a new Pre at Radio Shack with a 2 year contract. If you're new to Pre make sure you use your Pre for at least a month and happy with it before you start plunking down money for expensive accessories.Back to the topic: The case is way overpriced for what it is. It's just 2 pieces of plastic (plus a foam insert for the back cover when you're not using a touchstone cover). Depending on where you buy you'll spend anywhere from $22-30+. The plastic is quite thin however this is a good thing b/c it also feels quite strong so it will not add significant bulk to the phone. That's one of the main differences compared to the $5 plastic cases on ebay. Plus it's feather light. Fit is perfect. The thinness is the reason why touchstone works. If you're familiar with touchstone with the regular touchstone cover the magnetic field makes the phone snap into place quite firmly onto the charger. This is putting a thin piece of plastic in between the touchstone cover and the touchstone base.  So the phone doesn't snap as firmly onto the charger and you have to more or less find the sweetspot (you'll know it when you feel it) but once on the charger the phone stays on. Unfortunately as others have mentioned the magnetic bond is too weak to make it stay in place in a moving car.For those wondering the case does not protrude into the gesture area or impede gesture or the slider mechanism whatsoever.  How is this achieved? By making the tabs that clip the case onto the phone as small and unobtrusive as possible. And THAT is the major flaw. There are 4 tabs at each corner of the top cover and bottom cover.I lovED the case. Then on day 3 the bottom-right tab snapped off. No I did not abuse the phone nor the case (it's a new phone remember?). This is just during regular use. You have to understand these tabs are VERY VERY small and thin. To give you an idea each tab has a width of a dental floss and only about 3mm long. It's really just a matter of time before they give out and break off. So the back cover with 3 tabs now became a bit loose but still usable. B/c the Pre has legendary fit and finish (ha!) the loose back cover only added to the slightly loose slider mechanism and the overall the phone felt cheap and old.  Fast forward a month and today the bottom-left tab broke off and now the back cover is pretty much useless. I've had the case little over a month.Obviously I'm not the only one with this issue. You can find countless other reviews about the tabs breaking. Don't think we are the few unlucky ones. Given time this case will break. It will happen to you. You will not be the exception.So until Seidio addresses the major design flaw you may be better off investing in a different case. If touchstone is important to you as it is to me then you may want to consider getting one of those Zaggs clear films on the front - the film advertised as being used to protect helicopter blades that wrap around the corners and edges of the phone not just the flat top surface. The back cover won't need protection b/c the touchstone cover has a rubbery scratchproof finish and is replaceable.I've read one reviewer saying Seidio replaced the case for free so I will be contacting Seidio soon to see if I can get a free replacement as well. But even if they did that do I want to keep repeating a pattern of having to ship the broken case and get the new one?Update 5/17/2010: I actually contacted the seller (authorized dealer) about the case and they replaced it promptly for free. I just had to ship it to them which cost me just two stamps and an envelope. This time I got to enjoy it for about a month then unfortunately one of the tabs broke. I'm done with this case. I'll look into getting a clear film for the top while using the touchstone back.With everything said I cannot recommend this case. Save your money and look for alternatives.Update 7/20/2010: AGF now makes a case that's touchstone compatible. Google agf grt pre case.  That said I have been enjoying not having a case on my pre which also means I don't have to put up with the bulk and the headache of it breaking. In the beginning I thought I needed a case instinctively to protect my new investment. But with anything with enough use the amount of care and attachment dwindles over time. I just have a screen protector film in the front and a touchstone back. I bought the screen protector film off of e bay (5 for $3 shipped) and while it's not Zaggs and does not cover the entire front surface (does not go to the curved corner areas) it's good enough for me. Zaggs is overpriced anyway.
2	The first two Seidio Cases I owned were great one was for a HTC Mogul and the other for a blackberry Curve. They served me well. I bought the case for my new Pre assuming that I would get the same high quality case I have received before. What a disappointment. The part of the case that covers the front of the phone broke the day I got it. The rear broke off about 2 weeks later.
0	The tabs break WAY TOO EASY! i broke 2 within 2-3 weeks of use! i did like the little bulk added compared to other cases but i ended up dropping my phone 2-3x if not more due o the stupid tabs breaking until i just felt safer taking the case off.  i would pick up my phone & the case would pop off so i would be holding the case & the phone on the ground.  also if you do drop this with the case on the case will pop off! @ least the Body glove case didn't pop off when dropped (the whole reason i buy a case) i drop my phone a lot!Update 12/18/09Got replacement that went ok but within 2 weeks (possibly less) 1 tab had broken & it was just down hill from there 2 days latter another had broken & a 3rd on its way out. i took it off. less stress & less likely to drop it without the case. (i woudl find my self holding a case in my hand with phone on floor due to case breaking)try the Body glove one if you don't care about the TS charger! little more sturdy can handle a drop or 5.
2	It's a nice looking case and really protects your phone but it won't last that long. Eventually it will break from the corners. I guess that por the price you're paying you're getting an OK product.
2	I have owned 4 Speck Candy shell cases previously and all have served the family well. They offer superior protection due to their hard plastic covering which protects all 4 corners of the phone as well as the back.  The design also keeps the face (screen) from toching the surface should you lay it face down.  The case does not interfere with keyboard access or cause the edge of a screen protector to pop up.  The speck is a one piece design and remarkable except for one thing. As many have mentioned or discovered the thin portion of the frame near the bottom of the phone's face eventually cracks and then breaks off over time. The case remains fully functional and still offers great protection but you have a broken case that eventually becomes a bothersome eyesore.  I find myself replacing them about every 6 months so this time I went with an Otterbox case.  Not much better but I know it's not going to break.
0	The speck case broke very easily. The rubber that connects to the hard plastic separated on every case that I owned. Also there is a thin piece of plastic that is at the bottom of the case that breaks in half after some use. I would not recommend this product
0	Wow I wish I'd have read the other reviews before actually purchasing this product.Design = horrible. How people can claim this protects something is beyond me. It certainly doesn'tThe skin (that's all it is) isn't a 'shell' it's a piece of plastic that can very easily be broken and covers only the back of the phone.While I didn't have an issue with 3rd party connectors (ie: radio additions) I can see how this could be a problemWhile I didn't have a huge problem with the vibrate switch again I can see this being a problem in the future. My hands are huge and this is going to be a nightmare eventually.The worst part? NO protection is offered for the face at all. Most protectors at least wrap around the front offering a minimal sort of 'padding'. This thing? Nope it sits right around the back not even touching the front part of the phone. This is BAD because the front part of the phone is the one that's the most fragile!!
2	My bad!  I ordered the wrong sim card  but it came very fast and was used by another family member that has T-Mobile.  Thank you
0	We bought this sim card to put in my mother's in law snaphone which we are sending to Michigan we needed a passcode to establish an account on line to refill the sim card well that silly thing it seemed like rocket science for these people it  was impossible .My husband spent an hour on th e phone explaining to this robot the whole situation but Mr. Robot kept repeating his lines no matter what you said he kept repeating the same thing which had nothing to do with what we were asking for.  So the customer service is zero now if what you need just happens to be what these Robots  repeat then you are in luck if not.Throw the sim card to the trash.What else.I thought ATT was good service so back to old T Mobile.
2	Good price.
2	Hard to use because it keeps falling out of your ear. Not a very good product. Find something else that's my suggestion!
0	Overall this is not worth getting even at the 8 bucks.Pros:The earbuds stay in and have a good sealGood sound for calls and audiobooks acceptable for musicCons:Microphone is not very goodThe control on the microphone does nothing not with media player phone calls or anythingIt is HUGE when you have the microphone portion attached.  Essentially the earbuds are one piece then you put on another hunk of wiring with the microphone.  The microphone is now nowhere near your face and you have to figure out how to clamp it so it's remotely near your mouth.Would not buy again.  I have doubts this is an LG product despite the label on it.
2	To be completely fair this product is exactly as described online. I got this item in a timely fashion and the product was just as I expected. It fits the phone and protects it from damage just as anticipated but the actual design of the gel cover isn't the greatest for using the phone. The sides wrap slightly around the front and makes using the keyboard a challenge especially when trying to use the bottom corner keys like enter or shift (Look at the picture carefully you'll see it's cut out to get as close as possible to the keys I didn't notice that when before I purchased but the picture is accurate). The cut outs are right where they need to be for the side buttons and charger/headphone jacks though and this does what it's supposed to do as far as protecting the device. However I use the keyboard much too often to continue with this cover. I'm buying a replacement after 2 days of use of this cover. I'm going to try the one that Blackberry makes the pictures look like the sides don't wrap around nearly as far - this one is just too thick and bulky.Kudos to the shipper though - well packaged and arrived timely. It's a good value and will protect your phone - but not for those who use the keyboard excessively.
2	Feels and looks cheap doesn't protect the phone all that well.  If you want a great case for any phone check out Otterbox or Spigen cases.  Much better.
2	It was so loose on my phone that it fell off and was lost forever!
0	It's a bad and used battery even though it was listed as new one.  It has crack on one corner.  Charged it for whole day put in the phone still have no juice.  Waste my $5.............
0	Battery wouldn't hold a charge and was faulty from the beginning.  I was very disappointed and would not recommend his to anyone. Total waste of money!
2	This is really a great Blackberry that can be made excellent with a (relatively) simple software upgrade by RIM. First the good this device runs the same OS as the storm (4.7) modified to work on a non-touchscreen. This time around RIM has worked out nearly all the software and hardware defects that plagued the Storm. The Tour is faster not prone to defects (though I've heard of some trackball issues) has clear call quality the charger plug is in a better position a good camera/camcorder and a fairly nice speaker for a phone.It sounds pretty good right? And in most ways it is a great phone. It's glaring problem is the lack of WiFi. I hear people say Verizon's 3G is fast enough that that doesn't matter. Often that's true. My Curve didn't need WiFi because Verizon's network worked even indoors. This phone has a major issue with reception. Reception is sporadic. I can be sitting in the open and watch as the bars jump for 0 to 5 to 2 etc. It even looses 3G and reverts to the painfully slow 1X network or sometime looses the signal altogether. Aside from killing battery life this means it drops calls and you can forget about things like web surfing and e-mail. At first I thought OK maybe this area is congested or something. So I tried reactivating my Curve and sure enough the curve had 5 bars. Next I exchanged my Tour to see if maybe I had a defective one (it happens to the best phones). Nope same issue with reception. Clearly this is an issue with the Tour. On the bright side i believe it's a software issue that can be fixed by RIM. That's according to a friend who works at RIM. Additionally I tried a beta version of RIMs next OS (5.0) and the problem was fixed. So there is hope but it might be awhile.So if you can deal with spotty reception or manage to get one that doesn't have reception issues this is a great Blackberry. Sadly Blackberry's are internet devices so with no WiFi and poor reception you loose a good chunk of what makes a BB worth the money. My suggestion is to wait for the next generation of Blackberry's on Verizon that will have OS 5.0 and WiFi.
0	I tried two Tours and couldn't take it anymore.  I got an 8830 and it actually works.  Here's my analogy...would you rather have a Mercedes (Bberry Tour) that's in the shop or a Toyota (8830) that you can drive?  Here is my list of complaints and comments on the Tour:1) The trackball didn't work correctly on the first one.  On both Tours I realized I would accidentally hit the trackball when my left thumb would go to the right side of the keyboard.  (For me typing the word you was the problem.)  The bump would make the cursor jump in my typing and mess up the sentence.  On my 8830 the trackball is farther away and I don't have the cursor jumping issue.  If your thumbs stay on their side of the keyboard it's likely not a problem for you.2) The sound is horrible. Remember the old TV shows where people disguised their voices talking through a handkerchief?  RIM brought that technology to the Tour!  Everyone complained they couldn't hear me...like I was muffled.  (I did a test and heard it too.)  And that was on the HANDSET!  The speakerphone was worse because I was quiet and muffled.  Bluetooth was unusuable.  Really I'd say the Tour is a great device if you don't need to use it as a phone!3) Battery life is horrible.  After about 2 hours of talk time and maybe 5 of standby it was dead.  I used to talk 8 hours on my previous bberry and it could go days on standby.  What happened?4) GPS worked great on my first one but couldn't lock on my location in under 10 minutes on my second one.  It made me realize it didn't work on the second one correctly. Unfortuately Verizon disables the GPS on the 8830 so I didn't win on that point.  I did love the GPS with Google Maps on the Tour.5) The media player was fine.  It crashed watching certain MP4 movies but I only watched a few so I don't know the cause.6) Camera and video camcording were great actually...at least cell phone great.My advice is to get the Tour make sure you don't have a trackball problem and make sure you give your phone to someone else and have them call you so you know the pain that others will feel when talking to you.  For me it was unbearable to have people say what? 5 times per conversation.  But to each his own...
2	I bought this thing because well it sounded cool.  I can add the fanciness of having my phone go through the radio without having to tear up my dash like you would for a Parrot and without having to buy a new car.Now dont get me wrong....this thing connects to the phone no problem (I am using a blackberry bold) and the internal speaker is suppurb.  I would give that alone 5 stars.  It is crystal clear on both ends of the call.  And really that is the meat and potatos of this device.But what made me buy it is the FM modulator utility.  I will be honest when I got this thing Friday and hooked it up I was so excited.  And it seemd to work really well.  Scrolls the number of the person calling on the radio.  Switched to music seamlessly.  It was nice.  But now its been 3 days of use. And here is what I have noticed:1) It will drop the FM signal if there is no use happening for 1 minute2) Because of 1) above when someone calls you by the time you hit the FM modulator button and turn the radio to the station i will bet you that you missed the call.  Because that what happened to me everytime.  So really it is only good if YOU initiate the call.3) Signal is inconsistant.  Sometimes its cyrstal clear.  Sometimes there is so much static it is unusable.  I found myself on an 18 mile drive constantly searching for a new radio frequency to be clear.  I can imagine if you live in a bigger city this is impossible to do/find.4) The info announcements via RDS on the radio screen are also inconsistant.  Sometimes it would scroll the number across of the person who is dialing. And most of the time it would not.Maybe there is some trick I am missing.  Or maybe a specific sequence of steps i need to do everytime i get in the car for this to work but until i figure that out I am not that impressed.But again if you ignore the FM problems and just use its built in speaker this thing is pretty good.
0	It didnt' work  I have two Blackberry phones that would not sync with either with of our Blackberry phones.------- We ended up getting a visor mount Motorolla which works great.
2	Got this as a gift to my friend - apparrently the voice quality is not clear - this after spending 120 bucks! Not so good with iPhone 3G - seems ok with other phones though... but not wat we expected out of a BOSE product...
2	I had high hopes for these headphones based on the reviews. But I had to return them because they did not fit my ears.I have grown very particular about how in ear headphones fit my ears. These Bose headphones come with three different sized earpieces. Unfortunately none gave me a solid secure fit.I have found that the dome-shaped silicone earpieces fit my ears best. For example check out theMotorola ROKR E8 High Quality 3.5mm Black Color Stereo Handsfree Headset with Answer Button. Note that I am not recommending the Motorola product just pointing you there to look at the ear pieces. Notice the simple bowl shape that fits inside your ear canal. I find that this shape blocks external noise stays in my ear and gives the best audio quality. Unfortunately these Bose earphones use a different shape which may fit some people but not me. I also noticed that even if they did fit they probably do not block noise as well as the bowl shaped ones that fit in the ear.Sound quality appeared good but my test was short because of the fit problem.
0	Horrible customer service - when contacted directly because I was dissatisfied with the product he(she) resorted to personal verbal assaults instead of dealing with the issues - wow - unbelievable.  Don't waste your time here - they charge a 50% restocking fee for returns! Review update: the seller is ALTEC.  I would like to stress that my comments are directed towards this seller not the product itself - the headphones themselves were fine no complaints there.
2	Well my husband doesn't like this clip I think its because he cant get it out of the case quickly. I think the case is fine...
2	This was a replacement because I barely bumped against a table and it snapped right off. Not sure how this one ended up since I gave it and the case away.
0	I got this belt clip with my OtterBox Defender case for my iPhone 3GS. The belt clip DOES NOT HOLD THE PHONE SECURELY so the belt clip is EXTREMELY prone to dropping the phone.In the six or eight months I've had the Otter case / belt clip I've dropped my phone due to my own clumsiness ONCE but the phone has hit the deck because this lousy belt clip dropped it maybe 99 times including once in the toilet! Because the Defender CASE is so amazingly effective my iPhone lives unscathed with nary a scratch but (oh the irony) the OtterBox BELT CLIP is by far the single greatest threat that my iPhone faces. The BELT CLIP warrants NO STARS zero zip nada nil.The design of this belt clip is simply a failure. First of all unless everything is absolutely perfect the Defender case does not snap in to this belt clip. If any part of (sides or bottom) the Otter Defender silicone cover is not perfectly fit onto the case and properly closed up or if any small bit of your clothing fabric gets into the mix the phone will not lock as it goes in to the belt clip. Since THERE IS NO FEEDBACK as to whether it's locked in the only way you find out it's not locked in is when the phone falls on the ground or floor (or in the water). Even when it does snap in it's not a very strong hold so any very significant jolt or bump or movement or any halfway decent excuse and this worthless belt clip will drop your $5-6-7-800  worth of iPhone careening onto the concrete. Finally the clamp that actually clips the holder onto your pants has a locked open setting. I have no idea what positive purpose of this design was intended for but in practice it tends to lock open when you do NOT want it open as you are bending and moving and so forth so again the whole thing is likely to drop off your waist and (again) hit the ground.I strongly recommend the Otter Defender case but think people should know that the belt clip that comes with it works to the exact opposite direction of protection. I've had it with this belt clip it's junk. I'm throwing it away and am going to look for one that actually that holds the phone.
0	I have had three clips break and now buy only the case; no more blet clips for me.I do not abuse the clips unless you call normal wear as a teacher as abuse.
2	There are a lot of screen protectors out there and many are just cheap junk.  I have an Otterbox and the screen protector that came with it lasted a whole year.  After that I tried the ones from the mall and mail order cheapies from China but all of them fell off within 2 weeks.The PhoneDevil was middle of the road.  It bubbled up after 1 month.  Started to peel after 2 months.  It only lasted 5 months before I had to take it off because so much crud accumulated under the protector.  It easily accumulated had scratches on the protector that even the cheap ones didn't get.  My husband also had one that lasted just 6 months.  For the money it was pricey for just one and I won't buy again.  I'm using Halo now and pretty happy with them.
0	A waste of money. I followed the instructions yet constantly have air bubbles. I've repeated the process without success. Do not recommend.
0	I have this exact charger that came with an earpiece BUT the one I received from amazon does not match the one that came with the samsung earpiece.  The color is grayish ... the cable material is different ... the cable length is different ... micro usb plug is different ... everything is slightly off ...so ... it is a very close copy but not a genuine samsung product ... I am not going to risk using it on my phone and damage my phone :(at least it was less than $5 ...
2	this works for all usb cords great if your in the car for long periods of travel time. high recommend
2	I was so excited at first because it looks good and came at cheaper price but later i was disappointed because it is not charging my phone properly even though i kept my phone charging for couple of hours its barely filling 10-20% of its battery only.
2	After using this product I found that the speaker volume wasn't loud enough for freeway use (I couldn't hear people talking to me) and people had a hard time hearing me talk. I am sending the product back for a refund.
2	Nice product Great price Easy controls.I drive an '02 Honda insight. Not the worst for road noise but it's no Caddy. I could not hear the voice prompts from my Motorola K1M through the speaker. The voice calling through the unit worked fine even was able to use GOOG-411 voice prompts. But the audio had me straining to hear.If you have a very quiet car this would be great. I did not evaluate the battery life but it claims a month.I purchased mine through a local shop and returned it the next day.One Plus/Negative: Quite a bit of range. The phone stayed connected 70+ feet away from the car! (Really hard to shout that far.)
2	The speaker is very loud when speaking to someone and the voice quality is clear.  However the big flaw with this unit is that the ringer on it is so quiet that you would have to hold it right next to your ear to hear it.  My reason for purchasing this is that when the radio is on and my phone rings it is very hard to hear it.  I thought this would fix that problem by ringing loudly right above my head.  Wow was I wrong.
2	This unit works fairly well but does have some drop on the receiving end.  The battery lasts a long time but it really should have an auto-off feature.  Charging can be a bit of a chore if your car does not keep power to the accessory jack with the engine off.BillH
2	these work okay but its really hard to get them to attach without a bunch of bubbles.  The bubbles don't effect the performance of the phone but they do look poor.
2	Bought the product to use with my HP touchpad. WILL NOT CHARGE THE TOUCHPAD. The cord works for the touchpad but the charger will only work on cell phones.
2	I like the basic product and it works great.  However this particular seller did not send it in its original box and it was missing the cord doughnut winder that comes with all pre plug-ins.  Other then that everything was great and this rating would have been a five if the above was mentioned not included at the point of sale.
0	I ordered this charger for my Palm Pre.  It lasted 5 months and then the cable started to tear at the end where the connection is that goes into the cell phone.  After a bit wires were sticking out and it failed to charge my phone.  Piece of junk - I wouldn't buy this again!  Buy name brand stuff.  The one I got with my phone lasted longer than this rip off one did!
2	This is a beautiful device; small convenient.  Unfortunately it has failed in less than a year.  It was an excellent charger for travel and used for Palm and other phones.  I particularly liked the long cord; very convenient.
2	This product has been useful to me somewhat.  However if the car vent is vertical then need to adjust and find the angle that might fit.  Easy to insert into the vent  but a struggle to pull out  have to hold both clips at the same time to pull out.
2	Flimsy slides back and forth when you go around turns. The clips don't work on all AC vents. It is also bulky and gets in the way of either dashboard controls or turn signals. It might look good on paper but in every day use its in the way and annoying. I returned it.
2	It's not the belkin charger shown on the product page.  It works but I am dubious of the 5v/1a claim on a misrepresented product.
2	Does not sit flush in 12v car plug... unlike some chargers I have that are true flush mounts. 5v is what I needed and it is rated for that.
2	i noticed a lot of negative reviews.  it seems to work as good as the belkin i purchased at walmart.
2	I'd give this 5 stars because it's small (stays out of the way in my car) and it has a higher charging capacity than some other similar chargers. But I'd give it 2 stars because in my car (Volvo 850) the charger would not stay in the socket -- it did not snap in tightly or did not have enough friction fit. (Another review said it stuck in so tightly that you had to consider it semi-permanent -- my experience is the opposite.)  Similarly the USB socket seems like it's not a tight fit either.  I resolved both to my satisfaction by judicious application of some carefully placed strips of duct tape and now it's fine. But really this isn't right.  So I give the product 3 stars overall.  YMMV.
2	It is a good idea behind this device but it doesnt charge my phone. It only holds the battery at the charge you plugged it in at. Example 50% when i start the trip and 50% after an hour driving (not using the phone either). I expected more from a device with the belkin name. To me this was a waste of money but you get what you pay for i guess.
0	I would like to hand it to the advertising people. They make it sound like its a wireless charging device but in reality it is only if you buy their special case for a select few devices ... which buy the way is sold separately.  In the situations where they don't offer the special case a wireless to power cord adapter is available for purchase which negates the whole wireless idea again sold separately.  There are many other detail reviews that are all saying the same thing which is it isn't as sleek as it sounds and there are many hidden costs. You must add an adapter to your phone (which will make it bigger) in order to charge it.What I would like to mention is an alternative. Check out the following link to Gomadic's Universal Charging Station this charging station is the only true charging station that comes with the charger and a few free tips to charge many devices. I see they sell tips separately for over 3000+ devices this charging station is truly upgradable and universal with no hidden gotchas.Gomadic Universal Charging Station for the Apple iPhone 3GS and many other mobile devices - uses Gomadic TipExchange Technology - 4 tips included
2	I used to travel with a three outlet extension cord and still had to plug devices in the bathroom.  I bought this to reduce the number of outlets I needed.  Note that it does not recharge an iPad 2 and the door for the HTC EVO 4G is a piece of junk (see separate review.)  However I have been very happy with my purchase overall.  I use the power cube the Dual 1850 battery pack (reviewed separately)and iPod dock.  I also use the USB port for other devices.  No more climbing under desks to plug and unplug cords.  If you buy this be sure to read the reviews on the accessories before buying them.*****UPDATE*****After taking this on seven trips in three months I stopped using it.  I thought I should update my review.  I changed the rating from four stars to two.  Basically it's a good idea.  However in practice it needs work.  My main purposes of buying it was to be able to lay my HTC EVO 4G and iPod Touch 4G on the mat and have them fully charge by morning.  I would use the Power Cube for my bluetooth headset and the spare USB port for my iPad2 usingXMultiple iPad USB Charging Adapter.  I also had a Dual 1850.There is no door for the iPod Touch 4g so I had to use the Dock.  The Dual 1850 does not have the capability to charge against the EVO 4G door so you have to remove the plug from the door.  It is removing and adding that plug that makes the door break (see those reviews.)The bottom line is that you end up carrying the power mat dock Dual 1850 and Power Cube just two charge four devices.  Not only that but with four devices sharing one outlet they were not fully charging.I don't even use this at home anymore.
0	As an engineer it seems obvious that this product could not function as simply as marketed. The marketing is completely misleading.Standard devices like we all carry do not have an inductive charger built in so there is no way for the Powermat to induce a charging current in the device that would be delivered to the battery without some sort of wired connection.I am surprised sympathetic but still surprised that so many people would believe the magic works as simply as marketed - just toss your iPhone on the pad and it charges! I guess passengers on the maglev trains in Europe never have to charge their devices.It gives some perspective on the level of understanding people have about the electronic world we live in.
0	Of the four charging doors I bought none of them work as directed.  I have yet to be able to charge a phone.
0	This review has been changed due to the change in the product description.This was originally advertised as a wireless charging product with wired charging capability. The controversy over the wireless aspect has led to a device title name that is now impossible to knock as deceptive. It is a Powermat.If you are the type of person who will go out of your way to cut cable clutter at all costs including the loss of simultaneous usability while charging than perhaps this may work for your needs.Cable/Clutter Phobic: This personality aspect does exist. Although cables still provide the fastest delivery of data charge and functionality above all wireless alternatives to date there are people who will go out of their way to avoid having a visible cable.Wireless option yes. Easier than a USB plug no. Cutting clutter if you don't consider the mat and the wireless charging case clutter. Personally picking up a cable already sitting on my night stand desk or console is as easy as it gets.As a multifunctional charging base make sure that you investigate fully what comes in the box and the additional potential purchase requirements for devices not supported with or without optional accessories.
2	I got this Powermat because it looked cutting edge and I thought it would be worth it to spend $100 to simplify re-charging small electronic devices. It did not turn out to be such a great time saver and I am returning it.Please note that it does not re-charge ALL small electronic devices. You need to have specific models and thankfully most of my gadgets complied. You also need to place each item to be re-charged into a Powermat receiver case (additional purchases will be required) and then place it on the Powermat itself. Or you could use the universal case with included tips but this is almost like using the device's original charger.  Your device is charged through the magnetic connection  between the Powermat and the Powermat case holding or connected to your device. Remember to remove the receiver case after charging as it is not recommended for daily use.  It seems an extra step and the opposite of simplification but it charged fast. It lets you know when you have made a successful connection. The process of fitting your electronic device (iPod cases cost $40) into the charging case for the Powermat can be tricky at first. The included directions were not very helpful.Basically this Powermat is an ultra cool looking devise that is the same thing as a decorative charger station (Digipower SAM-G100-CH Executive Edition Charging Valet - Cherrywood) but with more steps compatibility issues and slight hassles with removing Powermat charger cases.  I cannot think the energy savings are substantial but hopefully it is the start of greener technology.I would not recommend this device over the usual charging cords unless you have money to burn and want the latest gadget.
0	It doesn't remotely do anything it says -- the picture is misleading the title is misleading the concept is misleading.  If you purchase additional receivers and attach them to your phone then they will charge.  Basically this is a sorta-cool looking but way-too-big multi functioning charger that is about as wireless as a showerhead.  You can read the all the packaging and still not figure it out -- until you open it up of course.
2	This power cube does not put out the electricity needed for newer tablets or smart phones. You need the power cube with a backup battery.Apple does not support the external power cube it requires the &#34;power door&#34; search it on amazonThe product works great I am very happy with it. I just wish more information was provided before I made my purchase I would have bought more backup batteries .
2	Cheap plastic. It will work but will not stay put. The part that holds the phone slowly move around. The part that plugs into the lighter hole does stay put. I would not buy again. Update 10-21-2012. It broke. Order Mountek nGrove I hope this new I order will work better and last longer.
2	I bought this as a portable phone holder for while I travel and use rental cars.  I wanted something that I could put my phone into that would charge it while also allowing it to be my GPS.This device is very bulky - taking up a lot of room in my suitcase.  It is also complex (with multiple hinges and connectors to give it flexibility in how you can position it).  Unfortunately all of that complexity makes it somewhat delicate.  It broken the third time I used it when I pushed it a little too hard.If you're going to install this in one car and keep it in place it'll probably be fine.  But I wouldn't recommend it as a part of your &#34;travel kit&#34; to install in different rental cars.
2	Not sure how long this will last.  It feels flimsy.  I also think this is designed to be put in place and never moved again.  The sticky base part may not stand up to a lot of moving.  Once the rubber part gets a lot of dirt and lint on it it will not stick as well.
0	I found it hard to see the iPhone in navigation mode and hard to remove the phone to answer it. I'm no longer using the mount. My car has blue tooth so the latter is less of an issue. The phone won't go into the mount with a bumper on it.
2	There is one major change to the way this product comes that makes it less desirable. This is the second cradle I have bought from Satechi. I got one for myself a year ago and it worked well so I got one for my wife's car too.  The first cradle I bought had the Smartpad packaged separately so you could choose to install it or not. Not with the new one! The Smartpad comes pre-installed on the unit. There's no option you have to use it. For some people not a big deal but for people who don't want to place something with adhesive on their dashboard or windshield it's a problem.
2	This mount is fantastic and the most steady and versatile I have ever used.  I have tried several others including Kensington and the Satechi is by far more superior.  I am going to buy the Sound-fly FM transmitter now that I have read several great reviews and have experienced the quality of the product for myself.  I have every confidence in the support I would get if needed.  It was hard for me to decide to spend the little bit of extra cash but I am glad I did.  The tech support is top notch. I am in no way affiliated with the company I just really like using a quality made product.EDIT:Four months later and this is still the best cell phone holder I have ever used.  Also after 4 months I needed a new Magic Pad so customer service sent me two!  They have the most outstanding customer service I have ever dealt with A++++.UPDATE:I have had this less than a year now and the Magic Pads quit working for the 3rd time and now the windshield suction cup stopped holding.  Both of these are big disappointments but it was a great holder while it lasted.
2	The SmartPad did not work on my Saab dashboard at all. It held for about 30 seconds total. I'm very disappointed but I'm hoping the suction will stay on my windshield.
2	I found it has not enough adjusting angles.That's my only complaint otherwise it works fine.Hope it could last long.
0	Not the item that's pictured here! Totally different item! Returned it as soon as I opened the packaging! Amazon should not host third party items that are not advertised correctly!
2	My only problem with the product is that it is difficult to see through. I thought this would be a narrow angle of viewing but it was too dark and blurred the screen too much.On the other hand it was easy to install and was the correct size.Edit: I talked to the seller I would recommend the clear version.
2	The product is old stock.  The sticky tab will not clean off the protective covering w/out scratching it.  Disappointed. Not a Deal At All
2	eh. doesn't stick very well and lots of bubbles.
0	These are the worst screen protectors I have ever purchased.  I am always applying new ones every three months and I have no problems with bubbles and all that and if there is one or two I can get them out but these were terrible.  I went through all three of them trying to just get one on without thousands of bubbles underneath and they were thicker than usual protectors.  I will not buy this again.  I went to wal-mart and bought them.  Paid more money but no bubbles.  This item appears as the seller described but did not work as supposed to.  Thanks but no thanks! :(
0	I have not gotten this part either at my house so i went to the p.o. and the post office said it hasnt gone past forwarding please fix it! its been a LOOOOONG time. This should have already been here also
2	I guess it works how its suppose too for what you're spending you can get better spending a couple of more $
2	Not real enthused but I guess worth the money paid for these. Ya get what ya pay for right? Won't buy from this manufacturer again.
2	Fits okay but not perfect so the edges won't seal sometimes. Extremely hard to not have bubbles like many protectors. Not very sticky. It peels up really easy.
2	These are hard to put on my phone without a bunch of air bubbles.  It does protect the screen and the price was reasonable.  Delivery was prompt.
2	I usually really like eForCity products but these do not last long at all as they are fairly thick and so they get caught on edges and pull up often.
2	Cheap doesn't always mean better. For the price you get 3 cheap screen protectors. They are somewhat easy to apply on but they scratch really easily.
2	Bought these for my daughters phone and she hasn't complained which is a task in itself so I guess they are good
2	These were a really good price. However the screen protectors don't seem to want to stay on after a while. My son had his on for about 3 weeks and it started peeling off around the edges. As they say though you get what you pay for. My daughters did not peel as fast so maybe if you are not too hard on the phone they may last longer.
0	You need to be very talented to get these on. They are very thin and bubble very easily. Unless you are a surgenyou will tear the first one.....That's why they come in a 3 pack.
2	Easy to put on and look like brand-new again.  But the bubbles on the screen are hard to release and the corner always open up when I put the case back on.
2	There are so many out there this one fits nicely and has lasted 4 months till I had to change it
2	Its really hard to put on but it does the job it will start coming off within 3 months so the pack of 3 should last you around a year it was good for the money.
2	The screen protector is a good fit for the iPhone 3G and adheres well offering the protection desired. While I had little difficulty following the directions I was unable to get a couple of small air bubbles out between the phone screen and the protector. They do not distort images but show when the screen is turned off.It was delivered in a timely manner.
2	I rated the screen protectors three stars because they were the only thing in the package.  The Lint cleaning cloth was missing from my package. For what I paid it is not even worth trying to get the lint cloth shipped to me from Hong Kong. I will say that the screen protectors arrived before promised and in great condition. They were wrapped so there were no scratches on them. We used two right away.
2	This protector works as expected nothing really important to say about it son if you need a protector this one will work
2	I didn't like the way the clear surface fit the phone maybe I'm not putting it on right. I will still use the other ones.
2	Took me a couple tries to get it on correctly! SoI wasted a few of them! And I can never get all the bubbles out! Wish they were easier!
2	its a cover.  Nothing special really.  But it work for what it is.  It was very inexpensive.  so it does the trick
2	I've bought these before at the mall for 15 dollars for 1 and they worked great and the guy used a tool to get them to stick without bubbles but i couldnt get them to stick without bubbled popping up everywhere. If you can get it withouth bubbles comingup it works great.
2	Well not much to say it sticks well and scratches easily. The lint cloth is pure junk. It is better than buying $12 screen protectors. If I need more I will order. I ordered from eForCity which I have never used them before but maybe again someday... I think these are my first protectors that have not came bent.
0	I was waiting for Mophie to release its iPhone 5 case and got sick of it (5 months? Seriously?) I read about the SurfacePad online ordered it and I love it! It looks great fits the phone perfectly and really allows the design of the i5 to speak for itself. I could not be more pleased!Edit 6/22/2013: I had to take this thing off of my phone as the seam in the leather (which was actually just glued) started to split and come away from the cardboard (!) inside. TwelveSouth supposedly has a warranty so I contacted them for a replacement. They claimed to have no record of my email address. When I verified which email I had used with them by sending a copy of the invoice I never heard from them again. TwelveSouth is not a company you want to do business with- they do not make quality products and they do not stand behind them. Avoid.
0	This is the WORST case ever. Nice in design but whomever manufactured it used the lowest quality materials. after less than a months use it is falling apart. It looks like it has been in service 5 years. Spend your money elsewhere. So now I find out that without the original box I cannot return it for a refund now I have to deal with the vendor and at best will get a replacement. So I'm stuck
0	The leather construction and the design of this case are certainly novel however it has a major design flaw.The iPhone 5 has a noise canceling microphone on the back near the camera lens. When you fold the cover of the SurfacePad back to talk on the phone and hold the phone to your ear the cover blocks the microphone. The result is callers will have trouble hearing you and you will sound all garbled up and choppy. At first I thought this was just caused by my location. But after multiple calls in various locations no one could hear me well. After removing my phone from the SurfacePad calls in the same locations had no problems and callers could hear me loud and clear. My conclusion is that this not just a problem of the SurfacePad but any case with a cover that folds over when you talk is going to cause you this problem.If you only use this case for using your device for things other than talking on it or you use a wired or Bluetooth Headset you will be ok with this case but this kinda defeats the purpose of a phone ( for talking on it ).It is also kinda awkward feeling and looks pretty strange when you are holding it up to your ear with the front cover folded back.I ended up buying 2 ( 1 red - 1 white ) Hex Solo Wallet for iPhone 5 which is a very cool case that holds my ID and a credit card and does not have a cover to block the microphone. It works marvelous.So if you want to use your phone like a phone avoid the SurfacePad  !
0	the cover is all floppy since it doesnt bend at the side of the phone as it can stand up as a stand. plus you get one piece of grit on it and it will scratch your screen.
2	Product looks good and has a nice color especially the yellow. I bought one in yellow and one in gunmetal. They look good but they will not help you protect your iphone. It's just a thin color change for your phone. The logo on the back does scratch off.
0	This cover only protects the back. The face of the phone is completely exposed. What's the use?
2	After 6 months of continuous use I can tell you the following:1) I get more compliments on this case than on any case I've ever had for any phone.  From both men (who think its similar to lamborghini yellow) and women.2) the manufacturers name wears off after two weeks.3) its easy on and easy off.  It comes with an adapter to make it fit into accessories with the case on which is not pictured but is very nice.4) After 6 months it has about 4 cracks along the edge of the case where it meets the iphone.  I will post a picture of this.5) It has made a permanent buff mark where the edge of the case meets the iphone.  This is unwanted but I suspect most cases do this.  I will post a picture of this also.Overall its a great case for the price just don't expect it to last more than 6 months.
2	Elsewhere I purchased BlackBerrys and have been installed with the Spanish language unfortunately these do not last due tirnen download and hope it does not present other problems
2	Blackberry it's an ok brand this 8520 works fairly good I use this phone for traveling and for basic tasks.
2	I WAS EXCITED ABOUT GOING BACK TO REG TYPING INSTEAD OF TOUCH THAT WAS DRIVING ME NUTS...THE PHONE LOOKS AWESOME KEYS PRETTY ITSY BITS..IF YOUR OVER 40 AND HAVE THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE ANYMORE...THIS PHONE IS NOT FOR YOU..UNLESS YOU PUT YOUR READERS ON ALL THE TIME..EVERYTHING IS SO TINY..EVERYTHING I TRIED TO DO ON HERE SAYS THIS PHONE NOT COMPATIBLE...WHEN TRIED TO BUY APPS SAYS OWNER DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO BUY? UMM THE OWNER? THE SPEAKERPHONE WAS GREAT..HAD LOST OS RING TONES AND NICE WALLPAPER SELECTIONS...I LIKED THE PHONE BUT IT JUST WOULDN'T LET ME DO SO MANY THINGS...I TRIED TO DOWNLOAD FACEBOOK WHICH I USE EVERYDAY..AGAIN SAYS PHONE NOT COMPATIBLE  :o*(  SO I AM RETURNING....
2	This team will not buy it for my nephew is no international version is AT & T normal rest. I have not used but my nephew is doing very well with it. Also I think the team is not completely new. By entering the battery cover will damage one of the fasteners and with the backing to buy him and he realizes that. It has a small manufacturing defect where you enter the SIM has a protruding plastic to be lifted in order to enter it.
2	After seeing these advertised and all the hype that went with it I didn't hesitate in getting one. I was happy up until my hubby bought a HTC desire S. As soon as I used his phone I became bitterly disappointed with my blackberry because compared with my hubby's it does nothing. I ended up giving my blackberry to my neice and getting myself a galaxy S2 which by far out-ranks this. I guess it would suit some people but I would not ever buy a blackberry again. The apps are limited it freezes up and was overall a disappointment.
2	If u r looking for a brand new Don't go for this. I ordered and received in time. But its not a brand new. Its very refurb. Seller didn't mention here whether its brand new or refurb. Tats not fair.. 2 stars for the product and for the sellers i can say buyers beware..
2	I bought it for business only with the intention of reselling and sold very well at least in my country do not understand how people would pay so much for a cell how it well we must seize!
2	LG Rumor2The LG Rumor2 looks like a rather advanced candy bar phone with a slide out QWERTY keyboard but in reality it is built very similar to the older LG flip phones from around 2005-2006. There's nothing advanced about it. Navigating the menu is a pain in the butt and surfing the web is ridiculous especially in 2010. BlackBerry offers the advantage of having a trackball or trackpad which by itself is rendered obsolete with advanced touch screen interfaces like the iPhone Droid etc... The Rumor2 is ancient by comparison. Most web pages do not load properly or look even remotely similar to a normal web page. There is no GPS feature with Google Maps so you have no idea where you are even though there is supposed to be a GPS receiver built-in.Email is also cumbersome because Gmail somehow does not automatically sync. The address book is limited to 600 contacts and navigating that is also a chore itself. I purchased the Rumor2 and the Beyond Talk plan for my dad who didn't want a really advanced phone. I use a Motorola Droid2 which is infinitely more intuitive to use. I'd recommend looking at the Rumor Touch but even that has issues with YouTube and it is nothing more than a slightly updated Rumor2.Charging the battery requires popping open a cap to reveal the micro USB port. Since it was designed for teenagers I don't see how this was a good idea. That cap will be lost sooner or later. More grown up phones like the Droid Droid2 DroidX don't have protective caps for the micro-USB port. One could argue the cap protects the port from teenage shenanigans but I don't buy it.Pros: Simple design works well since it hasn't really changed much since 2005-2006Cons: Not a smartphone more like a cellphone that has data capability not unlike flip phones from 5-6 years ago cumbersome interface not my first choice of phone.Overall: 3/5 stars
2	Needed a cheap back up phone for my son. Im becoming very disillusioned by Virgin Mobile and am about to quit their company after 5 years. If customer service doesnt pick up Im going else where. Im sure SPRINT took over which I had so many problems with them I couldnt stand them.
2	Given my experience with TENQA products (I recently gave a pair of their bluetooth headphones one star) I wasn't expecting very much of this speaker set and I was right. While they're definitely better than the abysmal headphones I really think it's worth spending a bit more to buy something that utilizes Bluetooth 2.0 EDR technology for better sound quality.Setup was actually impressively easy. You simply turn on the unit my computer had no trouble finding it pairing with it and then finding drivers for it. Once I switched my default sound device to the bluetooth speakers they immediately began to output sound. I was tipped off to the poor sound quality when the unit identified itself as a bluetooth headset in Windows. Indeed the sound quality is on par with an amplified Motorola headset complete with background hiss and disturbance. I'm no audiophile and use a pair of JBL Radial 2.1 speakers in my normal setup but these will sound awful to even the untrained ear. They might be doable as a kitchen set to which you can beam some Internet radio or something. But if you're looking for anything beyond the most casual use I'd invest a bit more for something better. More perplexing is the fact that these can't operate by battery meaning you'll always be tethered to the wall by them. Given that you're better off buying a normal 2.0 or 2.1 speaker set and using an audio cable to play your music.
2	The TENQA SP-109 Bluetooth stereo speaker system work well but could use a tweak in its sound quality.The TENQA is like an 8/10th scale version of the Bose SoundDock.  It sports the same arc shaped speaker front but lacks a dock of any sort since you'd most likely be getting your music into the TENQA using its excellent Bluetooth connectivity.  The player is very light in weight and has nice rubber feet on the bottom to keep it from sliding around.  All of the speaker's controls are on the right hand side of the unit and include a power switch a volume wheel an auxiliary input (via the included 3.5mm mini jack cable) and the power cord jack.  While it feels nicely screwed together and the plastics are of a decent quality the curve of the metal speaker cover can show some slight ripples when viewed at certain angles.  They are not bad at all but do show a lack of commitment to final detail quality.  The only other two things of note are that the system cannot run on batteries and does not include a remote both of which would have been nice additions.The Bluetooth connectivity of the TENQA is definitely this speaker system's high point and works well with all the devices I tried it with.  I streamed music from an Apple iPhone 3Gs Nokia N96 Apple MacBook and the Bluetooth dongle from the Altec Lansing BackBeat headsetPlantronics 906/R US BackBeat Headphones.  The Bluetooth set-up was easy on all the devices; you simply turn the speakers on and the power light flashes to indicate that it is in discovery mode.  From there simply link it up with whatever device you are trying to stream from using the Bluetooth set-up in that device.  The TENQA makes little tones to let you know it has successfully connected.  I'm not sure how many devices the TENQA can remember but all four of my devices remained in the TENQA's memory and did not have to be reinstalled.  If you are streaming music from an iPhone the speakers will fade out and in when you answer and hang up on calls.  You cannot listen to phone conversations over the speakers.  You can walk about thirty feet from the unit before the connection drops out.Sound quality from the TENQA is not the greatest.  There is no bass to speak of but that is expected in this type of speaker system however even the vocals sound garbled and crackly.  Complicated Pop songs sound especially muddled.  I tried connecting via Bluetooth and 3.5mm mini jack and there was no difference in sound quality.  Overall it sounds a bit like a clock radio.  I've used other portable speaker systems in the past and while they too did not have much in the way of bass the vocals were clear at moderate volumes.  Still I will say that the TENQA is able to play at a pretty loud volume before sounding completely garbled.All in all... the Bluetooth connectivity works extremely well too bad about the sound quality issues.03/19/2010 Update: I'm really fond of using the TENQA to listen to audio podcasts.  Sound quality is not important for this type of audio so the TENQA fits the bill nicely.
2	If you have heard of Tenqa raise your hands.  That's what I thought.  After some Google searches I found that they are most likely based in Arizona and sell their 3 Bluetooth products almost exclusively through Amazon.com.  Not a bad retailer to partner with.  When I got the chance to try the SP-109 Bluetooth Stereo Speaker I thought it would be fun to see how my first Bluetooth speaker would do.  And how'd they do?PROS:- It works- Sounds much better than expected- Attractive and compact design- Auxiliary line-inCONS:- Distortion at high volume- No battery-operated option- Port locations less than ideal- No instructions on connecting to a Windows or Mac machineThe unboxing was rather uneventful as there was only the speaker a 3.5mm audio cable  AC adapter and brief paper manual.  It took me longer to unbox it than to pair it with my Motorola Droid smart phone.  After turning the SP-109 on you notice the blue light in the lower right corner blinking which means it is waiting to be paired.  I set my Droid to search for devices and it was quickly found and paired.SOUND QUALITY & PERFORMANCEI had very low expectations but was rather impressed with the sound.  The highs were quite good and mids ok.  Bass was poor but acceptable for light duty and small rooms.  There was noticeable distortion at high volumes.  The Bluetooth connection was quite solid and I was able to walk quite a distance away from the speaker and maintain a static-free connection.  The stubby antenna probably helped quite a bit.DESIGNI found the aesthetics be quite pleasing but Tenqa's decision to place all the control ports on the right side of the speaker is puzzling.  The power switch volume dial AC power and auxiliary in ports are all on the right side.  This made an otherwise attractive wireless speaker look messy with exposed cables.  If you look at the 5th photo with the woman on her laptop with the SP-109 beside her it is cropped to hide the AC power cable.  Why couldn't they have put the AC power and line-in connections in the rear like most other portable speakers?  I also found the power switch and volume dial to be unergonomic and flimsy.  I would have preferred the volume dial to be located on top of the speaker for easier access and the power switch to be an actual button.COMPUTER PAIRINGI spent a total of about an hour trying to get it to work with my laptop and Windows 7 64-bit.  I even updated my driver to a non-approved Bluetooth driver just to try and get it to pair with the SP-109.  I finally got it to connect after rebooting my computer and trying over.  I selected Add New Device then paired it with the code 0000.  I then had to select the SP-109 which shows up as a headset and Control it which brought up an option for me to connect to it.  You know you're connected when the blue light stops flashing.  Still I got no sound when I played an MP3.  What I had to do was go into Windows Sound Options and change the default speaker to be the SP-109.  Cue angels singing; I got sound!  The bummer is that when you disconnect you have to reconnect again manually.  No autopairing.MISCTenqa also sells aportable Bluetooth speakerthat can be battery-powered.  The SP-109 is not that big and could have benefited immensely from being powered by batteries too.  This would have allowed me to place it on ANY bookshelf or location but as is my wireless speaker is tethered to an electrical outlet.SUMMARYFor the listed MSRP the Tenqa SP-109 speaker is a rather expensive option.  However since the actual selling price is significantly lower than MSRP the Tenqa SP-109 is a reasonably good choice for those who don't mind plugging it into a wall in order to get better sound than the really small Bluetooth speakers.  If not for the odd port placements and lack of battery operation I would have given the SP-109 at least 4 stars.
2	The Tenqa SP-109 speaker is a decent bluetooth speaker that is easy to use but it is let down by its low to mid grade sound quality.  On the plus side setup is a simple process that will have you streaming music from your phone or other bluetooth device within a matter of minutes.  The downside is that once you start streaming your music you will be disappointed by the lack of bass or sound fidelity.  In addition the speaker system does not support volume control from your bluetooth device so you must adjust the volume from the speaker itself.  Apart from the bluetooth connection there really are no high tech features to redeem the Tenqa Speaker.*** Positive Points Include: ***- Easy setup- Attractive and minimalist design that blends with most decor- Auxiliary input allows non bluetooth MP3 players to be attached.*** Negative Points Include: ***- Sound quality is low to middle quality- volume must be controlled from the speaker itself- no remote control or battery operation- only average build quality and materialsOVERALL:  It is decent for its price but not something you would want to give to anyone who is an audiophile or technophile.
2	The TENQA SP-109 stereo speaker system works well enough if you need a bluetooth option for your phone/mp3 player.The sound quality coming from this device is acceptable but there are plenty of other speaker docks out there in the $79.99-$100 range that sound much fuller.  I could hear all nuances coming out of the TENQA but it didn't have any warmth to it and there was always this ghostly barely audible occasional hiss to it when I was playing a tune via bluetooth. There is a line-in jack on the unit so you can plug anything in directly and I never head that occasional faint hiss then but it sort of defeats the main feature of buying this system.  I guess the most accurate assessment I can provide is that this speaker system sounds a little better than stock computer speakers. There are no elaborate buttons or features with this guy.  Therefore if you don't have high expectations for the speaker system then you'll be happy with your purchase.If you don't want to get a specific iPhone/iPod or Zune speaker dock because you have a different phone or mp3 player then I'd probably first recommend getting a solid $80-100 speaker system with a line-in jack that you can use with a 2.5 or 3.5 stereo cable depending on your phone.  The only reason to get the TENQA is if you plan on exclusively using your bluetooth phone or bluetooth enabled mp3 player (there aren't many of them I used my old Insignia mp3 player) to pump music through these speakers wirelessly.  The most ideal situation where you'd want to buy the TENQA is if you have multiple bluetooth mp3 playing phones in your house and you want any of them to connect to this speaker unit.  So if you have this very specific need then the TENQA won't fail you.  If you can spend a little more and buy a good dock instead though I'd probably recommend sticking to that idea.
2	I was able to get the Tenqa SP109 working with my Palm Web OS phone right away via bluetooth.  Convenient to stream web radio such as Pandora.  But I have to say the Tenqa sound quality is not that great IMO...the main problem is no bass so it sounded very flat to me.  I have another speaker set (starts with B ends with S) that provides a much richer sound experience.I also was not able to easily get the Tenqa working with my home pc bluetooth...I fiddled around for awhile then gave up and I'm usually fairly techie.So I give it three stars for being a convenient small speaker box you can stream wirelessly from your cellphone.  But no extra stars for the sound quality.
2	I tried this speaker out with my HTC Hero. The sound isn't as good as I might have thought. They had an OK sound but the bass is not good and you cannot adjust anything on it besides volume. This little gadget is pretty light however that it can be moved around with ease. I listened to my music for a while without any interruption.The major downside for me is that you need to keep your bluetooth that you are using close to the speakers. My place is not extremely big and I took it only to the stairs before the connection just died completely. I do not think the distance between the bluetooth device and speakers are as advertised as I did not really go far before it decided to die on me.Overall the pros of this is that it's a light speaker and the sound is all right. It connects well and it is easy to set up.Cons is that you cannot really adjust the sound levels on the speaker and that the speaker needs to be kept fairly close to the device.
0	I mean in 2009 you expect even cheap bluetooth headphones to be OK. These are just awful.My unit was almost certainly defective as it seems some wires were crossed and callers heard THEMSELVES instead of me.But even had callers been able to hear me (a luxury I know) the shoddy build quality and really awful design (they're HUGE) would warrant a one-star review.While the sound quality for calls is passable the unit doesn't appear to utilize EDR which means AWFUL MP3 sound quality.Anyway as other users commented keep looking you can get much better headsets for the same price.
2	Bluetooth Stereo Headphones are fairly common now due to the proliferation of stereo cell phones and music players that allow bluetooth headphones.I have tried several but so far the best set I have tried in terms of sound and comfort is thePlantronics 906/R US BackBeat Headphones so that is the standard I used to evaluate this headset.First setup for the headset is very easy. The earpieces are large (and somewhat heavy) but that allows for a nice clear user interface. Pairing is a breeze and follows a standard procedure that most users are familiar with at this point.In terms of fit as I mentioned the ear pieces are fairly heavy and they are designed to fit over the ear and behind the neck. However I found that the ear pieces were too heavy and were continually sliding -- the back of the neck design was rigid and not as customizable as my Plantronics -- which features a flexible cable in the back and an in-ear design to stay in place better. The picture shows a women wearing these while running on a treadmill -- I have a hard time believing these would stay in place while walking much less running.Sound quality was ok -- about what you would expect for a headset in this price range. If you are using these primarily for cell phone communications then you'll be just fine. However if you are expecting audiophile quality you will be disappointed. Bass is thin and there really isn't much nuance in terms of the sound. Sound quality reminds me of a transistor radio as opposed to decent headphones. But again you get what you pay for.Battery life is decent but doesn't last the full 18 hours that they are rated for. In addition it only comes with a short USB cable designed to charge through your computer. In my opinion this is a poor choice. As a bluetooth headset by definition these are designed to be used on the road. As a result you aren't always going to have access to your computer to charge these up. You can get an AC adapter that will accept the USB connection. However that is one more thing to buy and keep track of. In addition if you want to charge these while driving once again you are out of luck unless you want to buy yet another adapter. Before long you can have more invested in power adapters than you have invested in these headphones alone.As I said the Plantronics have been my favorite headphones for on-the-go communications and listening. Despite the lower price point the Tenqa's still fall short in terms of sound quality comfort and flexibility.
2	I'm not usually a fan of Princess Lea style headphones but these aren't half bad.  The price is right and they're pretty great for music but do suffer a bit on call quality and integration.  I was going to give them 4 stars because of the music quality but decided to go with 3 given that call quality isn't the greatest.These days I'm trading off between my Motorola S9 and Plantronics 906 Backbeat depending on my mood.  All of them including this Tenqa have their quirks.  But once you get used to wireless headphones there's just no going back to being shackled with wires.  It's like cordless phones as opposed to corded - the convenience and freedom of wireless is second to none.Music Quality:I'm rocking out to Michael Jackson right now and he sounds really good on these Tenqas.  The audio is crisp and the beats hold up with no distortion.  They could go a bit louder for my taste but I give them a slight edge in volume over my S9 and Backbeats.  I workout in a noisy gym and find it necessary to manually boost my music with an audio program to make it louder and drown out ambient noise.  The added decibels help but if I boost my music too much the Motorola S9 will start to distort.  My Backbeats on the other hand do a better job at handling the increased volume but don't stay in my ears as well as my S9s hence why I keep switching between the two depending on my mood.  By comparison these Tenqas stay on my ears well and the large headphone style help block outside noise and focus the music in my ear which gives the impression they go louder than my other headphones.Bluetooth ConnectionThese Tenqa HP-109 claim to work at distances up to 33 feet - and that's seriously over rated.  If you're lucky you might get 33 feet in a large open room but turn a corner in your house and these Tenqas struggle to stay connected at 15 feet.  Any farther than that and you can pretty much forget it.  The range on these is definitely the shortest of all the stereo headphones I have.  Both the S9 and my Backbeats can go a little farther without breaking up and dropping out.  But it's also important to note were not talking drastic differences here - it's a matter of a few extra feet in range at best.  But of the 3 these Tenqas definitely struggle the most to keep a crystal clear connection.CallsYes you can answer calls with these Tenqas but making calls is another story.  If the phone rings while listening to music just hit the button to answer the call; then hang up and your music resumes where it left off.  But making a call doesn't work as seamlessly.  I've fiddled with it every which way and read the instructions but there seems to be no way to initiate voice dialing with the Tenqa.  I can redial my last number called but to make a new call I have to manually dial from the phone itself. Not a horrible drawback but it does defeat the purpose of using these as your go-to wireless headset.  And call quality isn't the best either.  You can hear your calls in stereo same as my Backbeats but callers sound a bit tinny and as if the person on the other end is inside a small box.  Interesting that call quality is so mediocre given that music sounds so good. (Calls on the S9s incidentally are mono only.)  Aside form that people say I sound a bit muffled when talking on these Tenqas.Power LightsI'm not fond of big glowing lights on headsets.  The light on these isn't as bad as some I've seen but it's still pretty big and bright.  I prefer tiny unassuming LEDs as opposed to broadcasting that I'm wearing a flashy wireless headset that blinks intermittently like I'm signaling an aircraft landing.  It's just a personal pet peeve.  The light on this one is bordering on too large and should be a lot smaller for my taste.FitThe Tenqa does fit snugly on my head and stays on quite well with no fear of them falling off.  Each headphone rotates slightly on it's own to adjust to your ear and can also be twisted to rest flat inside a gym bag or backpack.  Aside from that the only other possible adjustment is to tilt the wraparound band itself up or down so as to get the best possible angle and fit.  But for me these feel secure with little fuss.  My Backbeats require far more futzing.ChargingThe charger for these headphones is just a simple USB cable with a mini USB plug.  One end plugs into your computer USB port the other into the headphones.  Some might miss having a full-fledged charger but in this instance I didn't mind.  Since USB chargers are becoming standard I'm guessing more and more economy products will skip including a charger in favor of providing an economical USB cable.  Besides I already have plenty of chargers and really don't need another one.  So I've just been plugging these Tenqas into one of my other USB chargers and I'm good to go.  It's a tradeoff - another charger might be more convenient but it's also something else to plug in and I have enough electrical gadgets cluttering my power strips as it is.  So I do the 'green' thing and share 1 charger with multiple devices.  And I'm guessing omitting the full charger helps keep the price down on this economy product.  It also saves needless clutter on my end so I'm all for it.Bottom Line:This is a mid range bluetooth stereo headset and the price can't be beat.  If you're looking for something that won't break the bank and sounds decent this is a good choice.  I'm still not sold on the Princess Lea style but I'll put these into rotation with my S9 and Backbeats.  All 3 offer something the other doesn't so I'm still looking for my perfect bluetooth stereo headset.  The best thing this Tenqa has going for it is the price followed by good sounding music.  All and all a solid economy model.
0	If you're looking for an average every day Bluetooth stereo headset this might be okay for you but it's definitely not for you if you're a music lover. The sound quality in the pair that I received is really pretty poor. Don't even look for quality bass sound from these - it's not there.I found that with these positioned exactly where they should be over my ears the sound coming from this headset for some reason seemed to be getting filtered in from far away. It wasn't a matter of the volume - the sound quality from the TENQA pair that I got just seems really substandard. Any bass sound seems to strain these causing an annoying crackling sound accompanying the music that's playing.Having asked callers how I sound during our calls I've been told that the sound is hollow as if I'm in a chamber and I found the sound to be the same on my end of the calls as well.As far as the headset's appearance goes it looks like it's average quality and these are quite lightweight - you may consider that a good thing but I like to know that the products that I'm buying have a decent weight to them and seem to be strongly made. I wouldn't say that either of those conditions are met by this headset.Overall if I were to place a value on this headset for the quality that they appear to be I wouldn't price them any higher than a ten note. These just don't stand up to the other headsets that are out there in their current price range. If you're willing to drop thirty for a Bluetooth stereo headset keep looking - these just aren't worth it in my opinion.
2	The promise of stereo Bluetooth is great. Who wouldn't love to listen to their favorite music and shows without wires with the ability to take make a phone call with the same unfettered freedom.Unfortunately no one has been able to get it quite right. I've used a variety of stereo Bluetooth headphones including theMotorola MotoROKR S9-HD Bluetooth Stereo Headsetand theSony Ericsson HBH-IS800 Stereo Bluetooth Headset (Black)and none of them are perfect. The sound quality isn't great and the connections are wonky. Sometimes they work well other times there are frequent drop outs - who knows why? They tend to do better with a direct line of sight Motorola for example places the Bluetooth receiver in the back of their headphones and caution you not to put your phone in your front pocket or on your front hip - well where else would you put it? Who carries their phone behind them?That being said the Tenqas are in some ways pretty good for their low price. The sound is decent and I don't find their connectivity any less robust than other models I've used. If you want to wear them around the house they're probably a cost-effectively solution. They feel a little cheap but they are cheap. So at least you get what you pay for.But beware - if you're thinking of wearing these out in the world you better be comfortable looking like the ultimate dork. These eyesores put the ugh in ugly. The models I listed above are at least sleek looking and kind of sexy - the Tenqa's look like something the Borg would wear. They're big bulky and call attention to themselves with a brightly flashing blue light that will make you look like a nut. What were they thinking?Pros:Good priceWork as well as some higher-priced modelsConsBuild quality matches the low priceTragically ugly - children will point and laugh
2	I used these headphones on my HTC Hero. The synching up was very smooth and I had no problem with that. The sound quality for the most part is decent. However this is just an average bluetooth headphone and in fact is probably worse than some of the other ones I've had. The headphones itself sat very comfortably on my head.The biggest con of this is that when I am listening to music on my phone it will skip at times and if I walk away even just downstairs it would skip like a broken casette tape. The singer's voice will suddenly speed up for no reason at all and then it would be all broken up.I also tried these for a phone call and was not impressed. While the headphone is sitting on my head the other party can hear themselves echo which did not make any sense as their voice was not being fed back to them. This was not even an issue when I had speakerphone on.I would probably give this 2 1/2 stars. It has a lot of potential but fails to actually work right when needed.
2	Cannot see this cover protecting the product from anything other than a drop onto a soft pillow.  The cover snaps tightly over the product and is quite attractive.  However I would never attempt a &#34;drop test&#34; with this product.Can't really recommend if you are looking for a protective cover.
0	I recently switched from an iPhone 4S - solid square cut metal edges a bit chunky - to an iPhone 5C the thin smooth plastic model. It's actually more comfortable in the hand than the 4S or 5S but it does need a little protection: maybe something a little less slippery. I first tried aCimo Shell Holster but it was awful: the foam case was too soft and it was hard to remove the phone from the holster. So I decided to go minimal and got this simple clear plastic snap-on case from Belkin.It's very simple very basic unobtrusive not at all fancy. It's almost exactly right except for one thing. It's *JUST* a bit too long. Just one or two millimeters. But the result is that the phone jiggles in the case. Just up and down not side to side. Not a lot. Just enough to be set-your-teeth-on-edge annoying.Maybe it's just me. Perhaps I'm too fussy. But when I pull the phone (in its case) out of the leather holster on my belt and press the power button on the top I don't want the phone to shift in the case.  But it does. Every time.Sigh.Update: I've been traveling in Hong Kong for the last week using my iPhone extensively for mapping Twitter checking conference schedules and so forth. The jiggling of the phone in the case has been driving me crazy. Originally I gave this two stars but that was before I tried living with it. One star only - and that's generous!
0	Pro's:Bright blue colorSleek-doesn't add bulk to your 5CCon's:Flimsy plasticDoesn't protect the frontLooks cheapVery slippery and could make you lose your grip and drop phoneSave your $10.00 and look for something better
2	The Belkin Shield Sheer Matte Case for iphone 5c could be better.it's really nothing for than a plastic shell that doesn't really offer that much protection.I mean it's good at protecting from scratches but it seems like the kind of case that could break really easily. So it doesn't offer much protection.Also I use my iPhone for music when I work out. When my hands are sweaty it's impossible to grasp the iPhone with this case. This case is extremely slippery when wetI guess for a price of $10.59 you can't really expect much out of itI guess for a price of 10.59 I don't expect muc
2	The Belkin Iphone 5c case in blue is massively bright and bold!  The hue is definitely gorgeous and is a bright teal in color.  This case basically snaps on in place so it&#8217;s very easy to simply slide your Iphone in and snap it into place.  No trouble whatsoever.  As for the actual protecting qualities of this case I do have to say it is very lacking.  This case is more for protecting the outer shell of the Iphone from scratches as it&#8217;s made up of just a hard plastic material that is also see through.  There is a large cutout for the camera and flash on the back and the bottom top and a portion of the left side of the case is totally cutout for easy access to all buttons.  This Belkin case is very shiny on the back and really does pop with color but I will say this same shininess also makes the case a bit slippery and I can see accidentally dropping this or having it slide off of a flat surface.  Again not the best protection but it is pretty to look at.
2	We have the blue iPhone 5c and got this to match it. Well the color is ok but it's clear and darker and not as shiny and pretty. Also this is one of those cheap covers that only sort of protects the back of your phone from being scratched. It does nothing at all for the front and very little if you drop it. We have now put it on our white 5c until we choose  something better.
2	There's hardly much to say about this &#34;case&#34;. It snaps right on easily but I can't see how this could offer any protection for an iPhone. You might as well not even have a case.  The only thing this would do is keep the back of the phone from getting a lot of scratches.
2	I was completely underwhelmed by this case/cover. In fact I'm not even sure how they can include the word &#34;case&#34; in its description - it's very light flimsy and feels cheaply-made. It *did* fit well on my iPhone 5c so I'll give it that. But otherwise I put this on my phone and immediately removed it. It wasn't very stylish and didn't seem to provide much protection. I didn't see the point of keeping it!
2	Newer phones can require more than the 700 mA that this device can provide. Many now require 1000 mA or even 1200 mA.Nice unit if your phone required less than 750 mA
2	I purchased this kensington charger to charge primarily cell phones. I had a personal and an office phone that took different cords so instead of buying an extra charger I purchased this charger and used the usb cords that I already have around the house. In that regard it worked fine. Although the charge times were rather long (I purchased an OEM Motorola micro usb charger later for less money and it has been fantastic).Anyways I do not like to keep chargers plugged into my cigarette/charger but this little guy is very difficult to get out of the slot. I like the low profile for my car as the storage area for pens/post-its is right under my lighter but this was too much of a pain to keep using IMO. Interestingly although the charger fits very tightly into the lighter usb cords do not fit very loosely into the slot. I did not have any issues with maintaining a charge for the few weeks that I used it but my sense is that as these types of products get more use what used to be an inconvenience turns into a disaster. I worry about the durability of the device.So I gave this charger to my wife for her new phone. Same thing she asked for the same Motorola charger that I had purchased for my car. Now we keep it around for back-up. At least it does not take up much space.
0	Went from opening package to the trash within 24 hours.. If you are looking for a throw away case for a weekend trip this will be the case for you.
2	The item arrived a few days after ordering it. After installing I discovered that the camera hole was not aligned correctly and thus ended up buying one from Fry's at 3 times the price. Maybe they shipped the wrong item(?) other than that the skin would have been great.
2	The description states for iPhone however when the package arrived in bold print on the front it says for iTouch. There are some small pictures of an iPhone on the side that indicates it fits an iPhone but it doesnt actually state that anywhere. As other reviews state the iPhone is exposed completely at the top. It is clearly too small to adequately protect your iPhone. Otherwise the quality and fit is perfect for me - a smaller frame female. I am sending it back as I need my phone completely protected but I wish it worked since it is the only one I have ever had actually fit my arm.
2	Still in box. Not sure I will use. I am very happy with current case I use (Body Glove).Update 7-27-2010:  Still in box. I know - this is no assistance to you all but it is what happens as Amazon keeps sending emails to review products. Will update if I ever use it.
2	Although it is good quality and design it is reaaallllyyyyy not an average person size... if you have frog-arms it will fit perfectly... lol
2	It works but only with very thin earbuds.
2	The holes are small for getting the cords in. and it's generally too small really to do much. lots of winding of the cord.
2	Setup of the gaps to insert the parts of headset are too small. Spacing on other similar ones are better.
2	But will it work? These run $7.00 each yet they are nothing much more than thin paper with thin layer(s) of aluminum foil within. Will they work? No way to know yet. Maybe that's all that's needed.  Packaging states that it blocks RFID scans and meets &#34;standards&#34;. Certainly overpriced. Made in China. Passport fits nicely in. Since it's thin paper I suspect it will have a short life just treat them carefully.
2	This protector is too rigid and it's impossible to apply it without getting air bubbles. Don't buy this stuff.
0	Looking at this purchase I shouldn't have expected much.  Under $7.00 shipped?  Stupid me to expect something high quality.1) Case is the BEST part.  It's hard plastic and rubberized.  It has a belt-clip feature as well which is nice.  It will protect your phone from scratches.  That being said it's Black rubberized WHITE PLASTIC so the first time you drop it or scuff it you have a white spot.  Not the biggest deal.2) Screen cover falls off almost immediately.  Really low quality.  Even when it WAS on it really made the screen look fuzzy so when it fell off I felt no remorse.3) The WORST part is the charger.  There is NOTHING rapid about this charger.  It doesn't charge the phone.  Then again when you hold it and realize just how light it is you shouldn't expect great results.  It weight about 1/10th as much as my I-Go for the car and it charges about 1/10th as much as a charger should.  If you plug in your phone with 1 bar of battery with NO other programs running it will have 1 bar of battery an hour later when you unplug it.  If you use ANY programs or make a call your phone will LOSE battery even with this plugged in.
0	The car charger did not fit my Curve 8530 and neither did the face cover. Buyer beware
2	The charger stopped working and broke shortly after I purchased it. Very cheap! I've never used the case but it appears to be durable. And the screen protector was good.
0	The LCD protector did not fit my phone from the start.  This caused it to blister on the edges which in turn caused dust to buildup and eventually push the protector away from the LCD it was protecting.  The Plastic case that comes with this devise is made of such poor materials that the clips that hold it together broke while putting it together.  I basically paid the money to use these items for 1 day.  Not worth the money and it was in shipping longer then it worked on my phone.
2	This particular case did not fit the phone cannot make a commend  it could not fit  a cute case to small
2	great for a younger age! I bought it for my niece and she loves it. I have bought twi more of these
2	I thought when it said faceplate that it also came with a back but that's all it was a back plate it just fits on the back the moral of the story always read everything and look at all pictures and reviews.
0	this item was broken when I received it the edge was broken when I opened the soft pack that it came in.
2	I purchased this as a gift and the recipient likes it. Objective review of the item reveals poor quality as regards the fitting of the item on the phone does not sit well and it makes the phone twice as thick.I suppose if you want to bling up the phone it serves its purpose and I think will protect the phone (should do for the amount of extra material around it). It's 3/5.
2	This worked good but the ear pieces were all much too large to fit in the ear of a smaller person.  Easily set up and paired to iPhone.  Like the voice confirmation that it is connected and to which phone and the strength of battery.  Clear sound both sending and receiving.  Just wish Motorola would have been helpful with even being slightly interested in making the rubber ear pieces for other sizes of people/ears.  Had to send it back as even Amazon could not get Motorola to develop smaller ear pieces.
2	This is a decent bluetooth headset for the money. I retired my original Jawbone after people started complaining about spotty voice quality. I tried the Jawbone 2 a year or so ago and found that the volume level was too low in my noisy convertible even with the top up. I recently tried the Samsung WEP 200 and it too had a volume level that was too low in a noisy environment. Please note that my hearing is not impaired.The Motorola H790's volume is quite opposite of the aforementioned headsets in that it is actually *too* loud. In the office at my desk I will sometimes forget that the headset is in in my ear so when a call comes in the headset announces incredibly loudly Call on phone 1. It is fairly ear-piercing even when I lower the volume of my iPhone to the lowest level. I have taken some 3M clear bra tape (used on cars to protect paint surfaces) to cover a vast portion of the speaker and it helps to a degree.That is my biggest gripe with the H790. It is very small compact and fits in my pocket easily. It looks far less obtrusive than my original Jawbone. There is no need to use the fragile-looking earloop for the rubber hoop design works well and keeps the headset in my ear. It would have been nicer to be able to charge the headset with a USB cable but I can live with the AC charger. The charger plug fits very tightly into the female end on the headset but I suspect that the fitting will loosen over time.The voice quality is decent but callers can tell that I am on a bluetooth headset. Compared to the original Jawbone or the Samsung WEP 200 the voice quality is not quite as good. Again the incoming sound is as loud as you need for it to be so even in a convertible I can hear people fairly well. The noise cancellation is okay but could be better (so I have been told).
2	The headset works OK (although people at the other end of a call complained about some echo) but it did not come with the ear buds.  It is supposed to as stated in the Motorola H790 manual that came with it but the seller does not have any . . .  It hurts my ear and therefore I cannot use it for more than 10 minutes at a time.  Also the packaging did not seem original since it came in an envelope and a plastic bag.  My choices are:  return it and buy the same/other item that is guaranteed to come with ear buds or purchase ear buds separately (at a cost of $9 plus shipping).  The latter option makes the device not be worth the price.  I will be returning it.  I do not recommend using this vendor (The OEM Shop).
2	This could have been the best headset I ever owned.  I had just bought a Motorola H375 fed up with Plantronics and Jabra's not being anywhere near as good as they should be (not including BT250v).Worked great for two weeks.  Talked to me - told me battery strength and if the phone was linked.  Convenient power on off - slide allowed you to slide off when not using slide on to pick up call.  Volume buttons hard to use - too close together.  Great reception - took a call in a busy factory across a large room (phone on one side me on other).Only problem was it was not as loud at the H375. It needed an earpiece to direct into your ear.  But the earpieces that had some direction into your ear (and left over others) would not stay on even if you looped this loop on the piece around the unit.  This would have been best ever - if I could have figured out a way to keep the earpieces from falling off eveyr time I grabbed the H790.After ten days unit just went bad.  People couldn't hear me I couldn't hear them.  If I turned H790 off and turned H375 on in same place H375 worked fine.  Returne H790.  Back to thicker less fancy but louder and with usable buttons H375.  BTW H375 highly recommended.
2	This is not the best iPhone stand but I recommend a different stand but this is a nice quality stand if you are looking for one.
2	Bought this for my mother-in-law's iPhone and she likes it.  It charges her phone faster than the plug in charger is easy to use and will soon charge my father-in-law's iTouch as well.Downsides?1.  Not cheap for the pads ($75!!!!!) or charging sleeves ($35!!!!!)2.  Though I didn't have the misconception that the sleeve would double as a protective case for all the time use it has metal prongs that contact the pad making this a contact charger (not an inductive charger).  It would be more interesting to me if it doubled as the protective case and was an induction charger.3.  Is this really that much easier than plugging in your phone to the wall?  Seems a limited benefit.
2	I had seen this on TV and became interested in it since I'll go for just about any kind of gadget. I had thought originally that by just placing an item on it it would charge. Clearly I'm not that scientific because that is not at all how it works. You need to plug something into the power source on your device then magnetically connect another thing to that which connects with the grid. Interesting idea but the way they went about it is pretty much useless.So this kit isn't cheap right? you'd think you you could charge multiple items by getting just this kit. but no its a starter kit. This is not the price point of a starter kit in my opinion. For what its going for it should have the connecter for 4 items not 1. Not only that it only works with a small variety of items. My personal cell phone from Virgin Mobile is not one of them.For what you pay you might as well just continue to plug your phone or device in the traditional way. You take up too much square footage using this to charge one thing then you do just using the wire. And beyond that it seems it might suck more power then just one small thing plugged in. Lastly I without a doubt will not be forking over upwards of 30-40 bucks per phone in order to toss 3 more devices on this silly invention. Maybe someday they'll modify it to be useful and cost effective.
2	Like a lot of families my husband and I seem to have a million and one things that need charging ... which means one million and one cords all over the house taking up all the outlets. The myGrid seems like such a great idea -- a grid that you just lay your device down on to charge it -- but as it relates to the iPhone at least it has several flaws.First off the starter kit comes with a case for the iPhone which makes it work with the grid. However it's not a particularly attractive or protective case; if you're a case person (I am) this is probably NOT the one you'd choose. In addition the part of the case that makes it work with the grid plugs in to the docking port which means: 1) If you drop your phone while it's in this case there's a good chance you'll damage the pins in the port 2) You can't dock your phone in any sort of device with this case on it and 3) You can't sync your phone with the case on it.Of course if you're using some OTHER case you'll have to remove it before using the myGrid case. What a pain! I'd rather just have the cables lying around at this point.Second the kit ONLY includes one grid and one case. If you want to charge two devices or more (which is sort of the whole point of the myGrid) you'll have to pony up over $30 for another sleeve or aDuracell myGrid Power Clip... this is starting to get expensive!Honestly I used the myGrid a couple of times but once the novelty wore off (and I got tired of taking cases off and putting them back on) I quit using it. It's just quicker and easier to leave a cord plugged in someplace handy or to charge my phone in my combo speaker/charger. (Which cost only a little more than the myGrid and has the added bonus of letting me actually listen to music.)Incidentally for those who are curious the case does seem to fit my iPhone 4 just fine. It's not a perfect fit but it does work since the i4 is slightly smaller than the 3G/3GS which the sleeve was technically made for.
2	This seems like a really cool product at first but really it's just an interesting concept.It's not cheap and neither are the adapters for different phones.  You have to attach this big plastic thing to your phone with double sided tape to be able to use the charger.  I don't want a big plastic thing stuck on my phone.  Maybe someday these charging pads will become popular and phone manufacturers will make phones with the charging contacts built in but till that day I want nothing to do with these things.
0	The only benefit that I can see to having one of these is that you have a limited number of electrical outlets. Or you need to have all your devices charged at one outlet in a area measuring 9x8?As nice an idea as wireless charging may sound it's not and to be honest probably as much hassle as plugging each device into an outlet with it's own charger (usually supplied when purchased)The mat looks nice it's thin and stylish only uses one electrical outlet of course and would grace any counter-top or area where you keep your keys and phone to charge them.While I was wondering who it was for I also asked myself who actually charges all the phones in the household at once anyway?You need to attach the Power clip you know like you would attach the power cord that you usually use to charge your phone. Hopefully one of the 3 included adapter tips will actually work with your model into your phones mini USB port.I have a 3 month old LG Shine I guess they're really obscure? And (you guessed it) the adapter doesn't work on my phone it displays MP3 charge error when attached.The box boasts support for Nokia Motorola and Blackberry and no doubt works OK with them mine requires another tip - sold separately of course.The box also says charge up to 4 devices at once! WOW! - with one clip? So I checked and sure enough you can buy additional clips they're only about $35 a piece!So to sum up for a little over $200 you can charge four devices on a shiny silver pad by wireless technology ??? Or stick with your original chargers that cost mmmm oh yeah they were free! Gimme a break. If this isn't a waste of money I don't know what is.
2	You've probably seen those brilliant hilarious commercials for a competing product that show amazed people gawking at a supposedly wireless charging device. This is theoretically the same deal. So you may be going oooooo shiny ones!!! already. There's a couple problemos with the whole concept though.Ok it's definitely geek cred to be able to toss your device down on a pad and declare to the hoi polloi oh yes my phone is now charging. Bring me a latte Robo-Jeeves. But here's the catch: you have to encase everything you want to charge in a rubber case. With contacts on the back. So it's not really magic.Plus you better have a device that they've decided people will want to charge. Otherwise no dice.(The myGrid comes with an iphone case and you can buy other ones--perhaps the selection will widen in the future.)Luckily I use an iphone. To be fair the case is not bad looking. It's just not nearly as slick as the cases that practically every iphone user--much less one willing to slap down cold hard cash for this device--will already own.And this case is for whatever reason jealous of any other charging setup.For reasons I cannot understand it covers up the usb slot at the bottom so you can't charge it or sync it without taking it out of the case. (There are other holes cut in the plastic so it can't be for reasons of engineering.) Removing the case is reasonably but not totally easy to do. Certainly you wouldn't want to do it on a daily basis.One bonus is you can't shock yourself if you touch the pad. On the other hand it stops charging which is something that someone with say a cat might want to consider.The myGrid is kind of a neat toy but for something billed as charging made simple it is quite the opposite. Charging made complex.I hate to be negative but I cannot recommend this device.Disclaimer: I received a free unit in exchange for this review. The freebee did not influence my review.
2	The duracell MyGrid starter kit is an interesting idea.  You can use the included charging pad along with the little clips to lay your phone on the pad and charge wirelessly.  There are there tips included: one that fits several blackberry models one for Motorola and one for Nokia.  The clips fit into the charging port and then sit on the back of your phone.  They use adhesive to attach to the back of your phone.  You then sit the phone on the pad with the contacts touching the mat and the phone will charge.  While this is a good idea I think there are to many drawbacks.First of all there is no tip included that fits Micro USB.  Phones such as the Blackberry 8900 use micro USB and thus can't be used.There is no iphone set/adapter available until Spring 2010.The clips bulk up your phone a little too much for me.The better alternative instead of the clips are the sleeves you can buy for specific models.  Unfortunately you have to purchase these seperately and they are not cheap.A lot of people travel with their cell phones and having this clip stuck to the back of their phone doesn't make sense as they probably aren't lugging the mat on their business trips.Interesting idea but the drawbacks are too many in my opinion.  If you are looking at this you may consider other options such as the Powermat which comes with more tips including micro usb and tips for handheld game systems.
2	Look this is very convenient and super easy to use.  I like the design and the concept of centrally locating a charging station is a great idea.  But given that all of these rechargeable devices come with their own chargers and one can buy a 6 outlet power strip with surge protection for less than $10 I'm not seeing the true value here.  However I will contune to use it with my Blackberry.
2	Looked cool but after trying it out I can't say that I'll keep using it.Pros:1. Charges your phone without you ever having to plug it up or try to fix onto your dock2. Case that it comes with is sturdy & protective [very similar to my original case]3. Fits both an iPhone 3g and iPhone 3gs very well4. Charged phone just as normalCons:1. Only comes with 1 black case [not very much of a deal & not a very big fan of black cases]2. Not a fan of the mirror silver mat kinda spacey for my night stand [both in look & space it takes up]3. Mat easily only fits 2 iPhones you could maybe fit 4 if you perfectly arranged but then how would you tell apart?4. To plug in my car or sync with my computer I have to take the whole case off
2	I have to say that I really do like this charging station.  The Duracell myGrid is easy to setup and very easy to use.  Included in the box is one case for the iPhone one power mat and the charger.  The power mat itself is shiny and attractive.  The charger has a long cord so you can put the mat on your counter fairly far away from a power outlet.Getting the cover on the iPhone is a little tricky.  The case has a pronged adapter that has to fit in the bottom of the iPhone.  So getting the case on the phone means getting the adapter into the phone as well.  The overall case design worked fairly well.  But and this is a big but... The case covers the access port on the bottom.  So if you decide to sync your phone you're going to have to take the case off of the phone.  Now if you don't sync very often this is not a big deal.  But if you like to sync every day this is a big deal.  Perhaps MobileMe users won't care.  But I sync every other day or two.  This is an issue for me.One other limitation with this... Since the case covers the power port you are somewhat tying yourself to charging the device with the Duracell myGrid.  So if you have the grid at home and go to work and use the phone a lot... and need to charge your phone... you will need to pull the case off the phone and resort backt to a regular outlet.  That or buy another myGrid to charge at work.I think that there is some promise here.  If the iPhone were not such a power sucker this would work for me.  I believe that depending on how you use your phone this may work for you.  If you only charge your phone at home this will work quite well.  If you are commuting to work and are a heavy user of your iPhone I would think twice about this.
2	The idea for this is great - come home drop your phone on the pad and let it charge.  And as long as you use the included sleeve it works perfectly.  It's the sleeve that's the problem - enough for me to knock 2 stars off.I understand why you need to use the included rubber sleeve but I LOVE the other one that I had been using - http://www.amazon.com/CaseCrown-iPhone-Polycarbonate-Slim-Black/dp/B002ZUKYJU/ref=cm_cr-mr-title.  Well I can try this one for a while.  But wait if I have my phone in this rubber sleeve it no longer fits in my belt holster.  Now I have to get a new something to carry my phone in to protect the screen.  On top of that if I want to sync my phone with my computer I have to pull it out of the sleeve anyway to get to the plug.  Oh and have you seen the prices for more sleeves?  $35 for a Blackberry sleeve for my husband?  And seriously it's not that much of a pain to just use the regular charging plug that came with my phone.Note to Duracell - if there was a way to keep it in the sleeve and still sync with my laptop I could almost forgive you for the ugly sleeve.So while this is a great idea the execution still needs some work.  So far if you just want to plop your iPhone down and have it charge without finding the wires then a charging dock is best.
2	Seeing ads for this made me quite excited to get one. And I have to admit it does charge just as easily as it looks...the metallic grid looks sleek and modern on our desk and all you have to do is put the phone down anywhere on it and it charges without having to connect cords. On the run just plop it down and it does the work for you. Every time you lay your phone down you charge that's clever.That said although I'd planned to use this for both of our iPhones it's delegated to one. Here's why...First what I didn't know was that you have to use only their rubber case around your phone to get it to charge. This makes both phones in a two-phone household look exactly the same in the same black case so one spouse grabbing a phone on the way to work may wind up with the wrong phone. (not good if one is a business phone!) And if you do have more than one phone you'll need to buy another case since this kit only comes with one.However if you only need it for a one iPhone household that should be fine right?Well in my opinion...not exactly...The second design issue I had with it is that in this case there is no way to charge your phone in the car. The bottom of the phone is blocked because the case has a plug that fits into your phone from within the case.  For me it's a real drawback that the bottom can't just slide off the case or unsnap and open to allow me to charge the phone at work away from this charger or in my car. I use my GPS often on the phone and talk on the phone often in my car so not being able to easily plug it in isn't good for me. The day I realized this my phone was losing juice as I expected an important call while driving. In order to charge it I needed to get the rubber case off. But the rubber case is quite snug so driving and trying to remove it to charge it wasn't the safest thing to do...I pulled over to do it. Because you also can't access the bottom of your phone easily that also means you need to remove the case every time you wish to sync it...they should have had some kind of removable bottom to make doing so easy because it's not exactly a quick fix to get the case on and off.That said if you only charge your phone at home never need to charge it in the car or work and don't sync often I'd say this is perfect for that usage.The charging grid will fit two iPhones.  I believe it says it fits up to 4 but maybe that means you have to have the phones all half off the mat because only 2 would fit on it.Additionally I don't care for a matte black case since makeup shows up on it more easily...and it's the only option with the kit.Conclusion: The charge worked easily. I wish this worked by merely having the wireless plug attach onto the bottom of my phone without having a whole case around it however--for the reasons noted.
2	It charges the way it's supposed to.  However the fact that you have to use their iphone case is kind of annoying.  Also the charging station is kinda big and ugly. I wife doens't like it always on the table.
0	At first I was very excited about the Duracel myGrid starter kit.  My wife is impatient with tangled cables running everywhere so I thought it would be great to set up a charging station on our counter with only one cable.  But once I opened the package and set it up I realized that this isn't a workable solution for my family.___________________What You Get:* A good sized platform to set up to four devices for charging.* A charger cable.* Three types of charger tips.* One adhesive clip (Yes just one)___________________The Problems:Starting with the obvious:  This kit only comes with one of the adhesive clips that is required to charge your device.  So this whole kit only gets you ONE charged phone.  That's a shame since there are two other charging tips included in the package.Speaking of the package the packaging was worse than most.  The charging tips were nearly impossible to get out of the package without damaging them.  I wouldn't have tried so hard if I'd know I could only use one of them.Most importantly this charging solution is designed so that you will leave the tip and the fairly bulky adhesive clip attached to your phone at all times.  That means you'll have a much bulkier phone IN YOUR POCKET because it probably won't fit in any holster or case anymore.  The tip and clip also interfere with any buttons that are near the charging port on your phone.You will also have trouble if you access the charging port on your phone for data transfer which is likely since two of the three included tips are mini-USB.  That means you'll have to remove the tip from beneath the clip before you can connect your data cable (and then hope that you don't lose the tip).I found this setup to be very impractical and to create more of a nuisance than the charging cables.  If the entire purpose of the product is to reduce the number of cables then the solution is worse than the problem.  My wife is the one who hates the charger cables but she told me to get rid of this charging station ASAP.Even if I could get over the nuisance of the bulk added to the phone the price seems way too high to me just to get rid of a couple of cables.  Remember that you'll need to purchase additional tips & clips before you can charge more than just one phone.
2	Let me begin by saying who I believe should buy a charging pad such as this one: if you have multiple cell phones that you would like to charge or if you are very tired of having to go search for your ordinary plug-in charger and then fiddling to plug that into your phone.  Also this particular kit only works for owners of Motorola Nokia and Blackberry phones.  Users of any other brands can forget about this as chances are high that the right charging plug is not included.  iPhone users do know that according to Duracell's website an iPhone version of this pad is supposed to be out in Spring 2010.So what is this product?  The Duracell myGrid charging system basically allows you to place your cell phone on a mat to charge instantly without having to fiddle around for a charging cord.  Many similar charging systems that are now out use a physics concept called induction to charge the phone where there are no exposed metal contacts on either the charging pad or the phone.  The Duracell myGrid is NOT one of these chargers however.  Probably in the interest of cheaper costs Duracell chose to use the older very common concept of conduction where metal contacts on the phone and charger conduct charges.So what does that mean?  It means that the myGrid charging pad is actually one large pad with a large metal surface area.  When turned on this large metal area IS energized with electric charges.  At first glance you might think that you can shock yourself by touching the pad.  Nothing to fear folks as the electricity flowing through the pad is too weak to create any noticeable shocks.  And to add peace of mind if the pad detects your finger or anything else that conducts electricity (like keys jewelry etc.) to be touching the pad then it shuts off the current.How do you use it?  To get the juices flowing into your phone Duracell includes a special clip that has three tiny metal contacts on the bottom.  You are supposed to stick on the clip with the included adhesive to your phone.  The clip then connects to a charging plug which is inserted into your phone's charging port.  That completes the setup.  To actually charge just place the phone on the pad with the clip in contact.What are the flaws?  Well the charger still works if you don't 'stick' the clip to your phone.  Instead the catch is that you'll have to be careful when taking your phone off the pad.  The clip is literally a magnet that sticks on to the pad so you'll then have to exert careful pressure to remove the phone+clip from the pad.  I think that's a bad design aspect in that if you were ever to switch phones you would have to attempt to peel off the clip from your old phone and stick it on to your new one.  Also if you did stick on the clip then you have an ugly and oddly-shaped piece of plastic stuck on to your phone for most of the day.  It can get in the way of your hand gripping the phone you can't exactly use many cases with the phone and it just looks odd.  Oh and personally I think the pad just looks plain ugly.  The whole metal pad with its black and chrome trim seems like something Doc Brown would've had in his DeLorean back in the 80s.What could be improved?  I think Duracell should do what other manufacturers of similar charging pads are doing and creating sleeves where the phone can be kept in a sleek-looking sleeve all-day that can do double-duty as a nice case.  In fact they seem to be doing this.  The iPhone charging system that I mentioned earlier is on their website seems to have this very sleeve.  Now if they were smart and brought it to the other brands as well.Also this product is being marketed and designed for cell phones only.  If Duracell could find a way I would like be able to charge my other devices on the pad like my bluetooth headset PS3 controller iPod etc.  If a wide-variety of devices could be charged all using this one pad then I would say the myGrid is guaranteed to be a hit!  At the moment though for just a few cell phone models I am not surprised to see the naysayers here on Amazon shooting down this gadget.Overall it's a gadget that is meant purely for convenience sake.  If the clip design were improved (and maybe the overall pad design was more sleeker) then this pad can be a big seller.
2	Overall I am not impressed by this.  Sure it's a neat concept to just take your cell phone out of your pocket toss it on the tray and let it be charged.  In theory it eliminates all the cables and clutter.  In theory.What you have instead is a semi-circle nub that attaches to your phone (or device) either permanently (through adhesive tape) and therefore makes your device larger with the weird nub sticking out.  Or you choose not to stick the nub to your device and only plug it in when you need it which defeats the whole purpose of the charging grid.And that's even to say that your device is compatible.  Be certain that your device is listed.  Mine an HTC Tilt 2 uses a standard USB to charge and while it technically fit it was wobbly and the back-side adhesive covered up the speakerphone (while adding bulk).But the worst part?  If your device uses the same port for charging and data.  Mine uses the USB to get power as well as sync with my computer.  And if you have the nub attached then you won't be syncing.This is a neat idea that no one actually thought through.  Instead of selling nubs they should sell replacement batteries with special covers that allow the current to pass.  Skip the nubs entirely.But having said all that if you're okay with the nub concept then the device works as advertised is safe looks pretty cool and is easy to use.
2	When I saw this product I thought it would be great to have at my house especially around the holidays when I have company over and there maybe someone who needs their phone charged but don't have their charger with them. When I received it I realized that it only works with Motorola Nokia and Blackberry phones. Which is okay because most of my friends and family have those phones anyway but for those of you that don't this is not for you. You may also need to purchase more clips that fit into the grid. With all the technology available this may not be high in demand. I think it is a wonderful product to have in an office environment or hotel conference room where there are a lot of people there that may need their phone charged during a short time they will be there.
2	The Good:*It works(if you have the phone and can put up with the inconveniences)The Bad:*Does not support all phones(check to see if it will support yours)*Makes your phone case worthless*Makes your phone bulkyThe Bottom Line:Boy oh boy was I anxious to get my hands on this.  Once I did I had to re-evaluate my thinking when it comes to impulse items.  It seems to me that Duracell rushed this out just for the holiday season and never bothered finishing the product.  Don't believe me?  Check their website as many of the phone models supported are Coming Soon.  Fortunately one of the family members did own a Nokia so it wasn't a total loss...or was it???  The clip that you have to put on the phone completely nullifies the convenience of wireless charging.  First of all it makes the phone bulky and makes any phone carry case you already use unusable because it would simply not fit anymore.  If you are still reading this review and still not bothered by the hassles then this product is definitely for you.  The way I see it this would've been a great product in the late 80s/early 90s when the phones were bulky but now we are in the age where smaller technology is better.
0	Before this product I had never heard of a charging mat/grid so this was my first experience with one. My first question in seeing this item was: why? Why would someone need to charge their items all together in one place? And who has three different cell phones to charge that are all different brands? The concept itself is neat but I just wonder how many people would really see a benefit from this type of item? For example I have an iPhone (and stupid me I didn't realize this item out of the box didn't have an iPhone clip) so in my case I'd be spending $76 (!!!) to get the charging grid and another $35 to get the iPhone sleeve (which from what I can tell isn't out yet). So I can spend $110 to charge my iPhone with the Duracell MyGrid or I can charge it for FREE with the cable that came included with my iPhone. &lt;sarcasm> Tough choice there &lt;/sarcasm>I just don't see who this item is for. Families perhaps? I can't imagine a person who owns only one phone would ever use this device. You'd have to be a family of four who had all just lost their charging cables to find a benefit in using this device. There is simply no cost savings here (cost increase actually) and you'll likely incur even more cost if your phone isn't supported out of the box (the myGrid supports some Blackberries LGs and Nokias).So I took this thing to work to see if anyone there would use it. Remember this mat only supports LG Nokia and Blackberry out of the box. However no one was willing to adhere anything their phone and/or their phone wouldn't fit the adapters I had (we have some iPhones a lot of BlackBerry Storms and WinMo devices). Simply put no one had any interest in using this thing!I finally got my boyfriend to use the item though he wasn't enthused about having something stuck to the back of his phone so we didn't adhere it permanently. When I finally unpacked this thing I noticed only 1 clip was included. Nice. Guess how much another clip is? $35! So if you are charging four phones on this thing you're looking at a total cost of $181!We finally put his device on the myGrid and yes it charged. It charged well. The device itself is very sleek looking and lightweight. That's about the only positive thing I can say about it. Setup and installation is super easy.Basically this device just isn't convenient. It's expensive and will likely require you to purchase other clips or sleeves. That's one expensive way to charge a phone!PROS:* Attractive design* Ease of use* Convenience sort-ofCONS:* Cost! OMG the cost! $76 is just wayyyy too much money for this thing. Even if FIVE cell phone brands were supported out of the box AND it came with FIVE clips $76 would still be way too much for this item.* Out of the box you only get one clip. Additional clips are $35* iPhones are supposed to be supported but they are not for sale yet. And again another $35 if you want to charge your iPhone.* I'm not sticking anything to my phone period. There's no way I'm walking around with something adhered to the back of it adding more bulk.
0	The Duracell myGrid is a awesome idea that went very wrong somewhere between their R&D; labs and their packaging and marketing departments.  The idea of having a conductive mat to charge multiple phones is something that is cool and could be used by many households.  Duracell's implementation of this idea utterly fails for a couple reasons though.First what's in the box in underwhelming.  You get the mat the AC plug one swivel clip and 3 adapters.  The 3 adapters are 2 mini-USB adapters (one right side up the other upside down) and 1 Nokia adapter.  Clearly the mGrid has been in development for years and is only being released now.  This is evident because mini-USB plugs are typically found in phones 2008 and older and the Nokia plug while useful world-wide doesn't have as high a penetration rate here in the US.  Or at least as high a rate among the type of early adopters that would be interested in this product.  There is no iPhone adapter (until Spring 2010?) there are no Palm adapters and unbelievably there are no micro-USB adapters (commonly found in 2009 and newer phones).  So if you're still rockin' your RAZR from 2006 maybe you'll find what's in the box to be useful.  I did not purchase this product it was given to me and I actually had to bust out my old RAZR just to test it...Second the conductive clip part has an adhesive back that you are supposed to stick to the back of your phone and then have one of the 3 included adapters jammed into the side or bottom of your phone.  Yeah adhesive as in--it's gonna be on there forever.  Adding all that bulk to your phone.  No joke.  On top of that if you have a smartphone that you want to sync with your computer through your 2008 mini-USB port um well you can't do that cuz you have the adapter jammed in the plug. Even if you slip out the adapter the clip on the back is still going to block many of the USB connector cables out there.  Finally if you're using your mini-USB phone from 2008 you're probably going to get a new one in 2010 (when your 2yr contract expires) which means you somehow have to peel off the adhesive to place it on your new phone (assuming you can buy a new adapter from Duracell's website in the future that fits your new phone).  I was able to position the clip and adapter in my RAZR without using the adhesive but the magnet is surprisingly strong.  Pulling the phone off the mat caused a lot of strain on the phone's USB port.  Repetitive usage like this could easily damage the port on the phone.  In addition without the adhesive it took me way longer to insert the clip + adapter in the RAZR and carefully pull it off the mat when finished than it does to simply just plug/unplug the regular AC charger thereby eliminating all advantages of using the mat.I will mention that the grid does indeed work and does charge up a RAZR in about the same time as the regular AC charger.  But Duracell totally failed in the execution of the device.  These people make batteries!  What we need are Duracell-made battery replacements with the small metal conductance nubs on the back.  This way you just pop in the new battery and can lay the phone without any extra bulk directly on the grid.  Palm does this with their Pre phone and the Touchstone accessory and it works incredibly well.  Also Duracell should offer replacement batteries/adapters for cameras video game controllers and other electronic devices.  This would be a 5-star highly versatile product if they did all this.  But no instead we get 2 mini-USB plugs a Nokia plug and one swivel clip.  A craptastic failure pile in a box!As a techie gadget lover I want to really like this product.  The actual grid itself is cool.  Unfortunately there is no other word to adequately describe the adapters + clip idea other than stupid.  At the time of writing this the Grid goes for $70-90.  If they dropped the price to $50 included adapters for video game controllers and cameras and offered conductive replacement batteries on their website like I mentioned above this thing would be a gadget-person's dream charging station.  Until then I'm not sure how the people at Duracell pushed this out to market.  Too bad...
2	My family is a family of iPhones. When I saw this product from a trusted brand like Duracell nonetheless I was quick to snap it up thinking that it would be a great and easy way to charge our iPhones simultaneously.I understood that each phone needed to be put in a separate sleeve/case to charge but I didn't expect the individual cases to be so expensive. Also the case needs to be removed if you're going to do something like sync the phone up with your computer. I suppose this makes sense since if you're going to be plugging the phone into the computer you may as well let it charge up from that. Contrary to other reviewers I don't find the case ultra bulky or unattractive at all. It's sturdy enough to be used as your regular case (although I'm not sure how safe that would be with the prong on the back for charging) and the only bulky part is the bottom which protrudes a little.The charging pad itself is quite small and doesn't take up much space on the counter which is a plus in itself but as other reviewers have stated it's hard to believe that four devices can be charged simultaneously on this thing.On the plus side it's pretty much plug and play. It requires little setup or knowledge to use this thing and is easy to charge up two phones at the same time. It's pretty useless for charging just one phone since getting the charging case on it isn't any easier than simply plugging the phone into a computer or wall.
2	Warning: This starter kit only includes 1 'Power Clip' so I find the cover art and description fairly misleading as you can only get 1 phone on here for $80 and you need to spend almost $20 to get the other power clips. This is an extremely expensive outlay.Other design drawbacks:- Although the charging pad looks awesome you need to have a big plastic sticker on attached to the back of your phone. It doesn't look sleek.- Newer blackberries are not supported- The power sleeves for the Iphone are fairly bulky and not very sleek.
2	The USB charger interface was very famous in 2007 and early 2008. In 2009 most phones including RIM phones such as the blackberry tour blackberry javelin blackberry storm and the blackberry 8520/8530 saw the transition to Micro-USB interface. Even the Palm Pre uses Micro-USB.What this basically means is that one needs a micro usb charging plug in order to make this device work.Unfortunately this device does not as of yet ship with a micro-usb plug thereby rendering it a little useless for me.Of course one can add on more plugs and go use the device but when almost all the phones/devices in my house use micro-usb this seems a little aimless.Where one is spending a decent sum of money one expects the product to ship with all the bells and whistles instead of going hunting for smaller devices.
2	This was really cool at first...cordless charging I mean what's NOT cool about that? However it quickly became a pain to have to remove the regular case and put it into the charging case. It does charge quickly and completely and the case is easy to put on. However it's much simpler to just use a case that gives access to the ports and plug in a charger. Personally I don't think this is something I'll continue using. For what it's supposed to do though it does it very well!
2	This device represents an very intriguing idea --  a single device by the door for all the family members to be able to just flop your devices and presto they all get charged.  But in execution this doesn't come close and I'd recommend a pass on this product especially the iPhone version.1. Your iPhone has to be put into a special Duracell sleeve to work on the unit.  But with the sleeve on you cannot use the iPhone USB cable to SYNC your device or use in any other cradle type device.  Taking off theDuracall case would get old very quick.2. You have to give up whatever case you have today.  Although the rubber case included is of decent construction it is nothing to brag about.3. In this package you get only ONE case/sleeve.  You can buy others but at $35/each.4. Only two iPhones would fit on the MyGrid (see the phone) - NOT the four it says on the box; plus the power supply is limited for multiple iPhone devices.5. Unlike a charging cable and wall plug the charging pad does take up space even if you are not charging anything.The MyGrid is great idea but it makes charger harder not easier.  You'd be better off buying two Apple charging docks.
2	This is a great idea for a household with multiple cell phones no need to fumble in and about for chargers just place the tips for the designated phone hook it up with the clip set it down on the charging pad and your phone is charging. The mat/pad is super-thin and can be placed unobstrusively in a side desk or a far corner of the kitchen counter. It can charge multiple devices PROVIDED it is compatible with charging port tips you hook with in your phone. The box indicates it can be used with certain (not all) Nokia Motorola and Blackberry phones. If you own other brands such as Samsung or an LG the charging port tips with this kit can't be used for these phones because the charging port comes in a different shape. The charging port for older Samsung phones for example comes in a very odd shape. I just don't know if you can buy specific tips for specific phones in the Duracell website haven't looked up on that. In my household 2 phones were compatible with this charging kit one Nokia and the other is a Motorola. Bear in mind that this is a starter kit with only one clip to charge the phone. You have to buy additional clips to be able to charge multiple phones. I personally own an HTC MyTouch 3G although the tip looks like it will fit I wouldn't dare try to hook it up for fear of shorting out my phone.The whole set-up wasn't that hard although I advise you to read the manual very carefully and MAKE SURE FIRST if your phone is compatible. It would be nice if versatility of this product would include a variety of other cell phones and devices like MP3 players and game controllers. Now that would warrant a 5-star for this product. Overall it is convenience and simplicity a useful tool for people who doesn't want to fumble with chargers although this problem can be solved if you just place your charger in a stationary position. For more versatility you can buy a sleeve instead of a clip where you just insert the whole phone in a charging sleeve but at $35 a pop not really sure if that makes more sense than to just plainly use your regular charger. Overall this is a nice idea but falls short on the limited number of phones you can use it with. 3-star at best!
2	The Duracell myGrid charges devices wirelessly. That sounds cool but then you realize those devices have to be inserted into a special case. So in order to use this product you will either have to put your iPhone into and out of the special case or simply decide to use the included case which adds a bulky piece to the bottom charging region of your phone. The case fits the iPhone 3G well will sorta fit an iPod touch and sorta fit an iPhone 4.The charger works great. Simply place the phone on the charging pad and it charges. No problems there.The charger plate is very thin about as thick as ten pieces of paper. The charging side is covered by shiny metal strips that are harmless to touch so as far as I can tell there is no shock risk from the device. However whenever touched the device smudges and shows finger prints like crazy. Not a major problem but just annoying.It says that the plate charges up to 4 devices; I'm not sure I could fit four devices on the plate. But you must realize that for each device you want to charge you will have to pay for the very expensive charging case. All said and done by the time you get the starter kit and the cases to charge 4 devices (the starter kit comes with 1 case) you will be out about a hundred and fifty bucks.The one use that I see the myGrid serving well is as a charging dock on a desk. Keeping the phone plugged in and then unplugging it everytime I want to use it is a real pain. So being able to keep my phone charged by just tossing it down on the desk is very appealing to me. However the case is so annoying that I think that the case will just stay with the myGrid for use only when sitting at the desk.I do not recommend the product for general use. It is a cool idea but a somewhat annoying and costly implementation.
0	The Duracell Powergrid is trying desperately to capitalize on the new cordless charging device playground but the service that this item provides is so out of date that it borders on being embarrassing. Basically the device's cordless charging capabilities are based on a sort of remote plug that you put into your wireless phone or mp3 player and then you lay it on the pad. The three chargers that come with the device are for devices that are so old that you would need to travel back in time at least three years to find a device that you could put these chargers in. So forget your iPod or your newer Blackberry or newer wireless device period. You want to charge those on the Powergrid guess what you have to do?You have to buy the chargers.There is no way any part of this device will simplify your life or even make you happy in any way so just skip it.
2	After a week of testing the Duracell myGrid proved to be functional and easy to use but practical considerations keep it from receiving a stronger recommendation.The product arrives with a myGrid Charging Pad one Power Sleeve and an AC adapter. The charging pad is a simple flat square (an 8 x 8 area of dead space that can't be used for anything else) with silver contacts arranged in rows along its top which resembles a solar panel. The bottom is a no-skid material and worked well on all flat surfaces tested (wood linoleum metal plastic etc.).The Power Sleeve is made of no-skid flat black rubber which was easy to put on and remove from the iPhone and worked well on all surfaces as well. It has a built-in plug that connects directly to the iPhone's power connector and has openings for most components (e.g. speakers and vibrate toggle). The iPhone charges by placing it in the Power Sleeve and resting the Sleeve anywhere on the charging pad.Two problems:While the charging pad seemed to charge as quickly as the power cable that came with the iPhone the Power Sleeve plugs directly into the iPhone's power connector which meant I had to remove it in order to plug my iPhone into the wall to recharge (when I was away from the myGrid). The constant putting on and taking off was annoying (though not difficult).Solutions?Ignore the myGrid altogether and simply buy another charging cable.Wait for Duracell to redesign the Sleeve so that it allows the user to plug in a power cable.Buy a separate MyGrid for each place I plan to go or carry the MyGrid everywhere I go.Do I recommend this product? Not really; although it is easy to use it manages to be convenient and maddeningly frustrating at the same time. A better Power Sleeve design would alleviate some of the problems but most techies will not like dead space on their desk.Rating: 3 stars.
2	When ordering this device I expected that it was universal i.e. for all cell phone types but as it happens it only works with iPhones.  It's not the product's fault that I don't own an iPhone but I would argue that the packaging should call it out in a larger font (pictures of iPhones on the cover notwithstanding).  To be fair Amazon's description does specifically indicate it is for iPhones.
0	This product is a case of creating a poor solution for a problem that doesn't really exist. It was really easy to charge my phone by plugging it into the charger that came with it. But wait instead you now want me to glue on some weird disc to the back of my phone and add special tips just so that I can charge it? Or I have to buy a special sleeve which adds bulk and cost to do the same? No thanks.
2	The concept of thePowermat Home & Office Mat (Black) [Doors Sold Separately] and Duracell myGrid are both similar. One single charging board plugs into an outlet which allows you to charge up to four devices without any additional wires. Technically the fourth device with the Powermat has to be plugged in via a USB connection.Here's the big drawback ... you have to use a special case for the device. The problem with the cases is that for devices where you synchronize with a computer (e.g. iPhone) you have to remove the device from the case to complete the process. Also if you don't have the charging board with you then that means having to remove the case to charge in your car office etc. You can buy additional charging boards but that will run you in between $75 - $100.  There's tons of cases that allow you to charge and synchronize without having to remove the case. It also means you have to plug into the outlet to charge but I'm not sure which is the lesser of two evils.The additional drawback with the iPhone case packaged with the Duracell myGrid Starter Kit is that the volume controls rocker for ring/vibrate and lock button are all hard to access. There are slots to access these controls but the thickness of the rubber case makes it so you have to use your fingernails. There are other rubber cases available for the iPhone with the same thickness that allow easier access by covering up these controls with a softer rubber button. Pressing down on that area pushes onto the control and has the desired effect. It would have been nice if Duracell thought that through with this case.One last thing worth noting is that you will not be able to charge 4 iPhones at once. Duracell indicates that you can charge 4 devices simultaneously but the key is devices not iPhones. You can only charge 2 iPhones simultaneously.Overall this is a great concept but it still has not been fully flushed out. I can't see spending over $70 to charge my iPhone with a case I continually have to remove and controls that are hard to reach. I'd rather carry around a charger I can plug into an outlet and one I can use in my car which would cost me around $20. I can use the extra $50 to buy a really nice case for under $50 and still have money left over.With that said if you insist on using this type of solution I would strongly consider the Duracell myGrid over the Powermat since they do the same thing but the Duracell solution will save you about $65.********* I received this product for free as part of the Amazon.com Vine program. Nonetheless I review the product in the same manner as I would if I had purchased it myself. *********
2	Having just acquired my Iphone 4 yesterday I decided to give my old 3g to my 4 year old daughter since i had a ton of apps on their for her and I also had all her Backyardigans tunes as well. So I broke out the MyGrid Charger plugged it in and threw on the skin that houses the 3g phone. I placed the phone on the charger and badabing its charging! Very neat. I can see this being useful for lazy people who forget to plug their phones into a dock or cable to charge. The drawbacks are the skin for the phone and actually trying to sync the phone. As other reviewers said the skin is pretty bland and ugly. My daughter is fine with it but I am sure she would enjoy a different color skin (pink) from amazon. Also syncing the unit is a pain as you have to remove the skin.Overall it is fine for what it does charging without cables. I recommend it to people who forget to charge their phones and also who just are satisfied with what is on their phone at the time being (no syncing daily).
2	The Duracell myGrid for iPhone does exactly what it claims to do. That is not the problem. The main criticism I have about the myGrid is that it is unnecessary.The kit consists of a soft plastic case for the phone and an approximately 6 by 9 inch grid on which you lay the phone while in the special case. Four contact points on the back of the case transfer power from the grid to the case. The phone is docked inside the case which is how the power gets into the phone. If you put something metal (or even touch the grid) it shorts and turns itself off. You cannot dock the phone while it is in the case. The grid only charges the phone. To sync the phone you have to take it out of the case. This makes the case almost useless.Charging is just as quick as with the iPhone wall charger. The case adds approximately 2mm of extra thickness to the back of the phone and an approximately 5mm nub to the bottom of the phone. This kept it from fitting in my belt holster.The case feels cheaply made. All the required holes are there except the dock. The camera hole did not line up perfectly. While the phone is in the case it is hard to operate the volume silencer and off switches.If the loss of the dock were not enough here is my main criticism. Why is this needed? It is not very difficult to attach a cable to charge an iPhone. Plus the grid takes up space. Maybe if you wanted to charge multiple devices on the same grid there would be a convenience factor but not for just one device.The disadvantages are: a poor quality case increased size of the phone space for the grid and an inability to sync (or dock with anything) while the phone is in the case.The advantages are: none.
2	Ever been bitten by an elephant?  But you've probably been bitten by a mosquito...it's the little things that get you!And it is the little things that drop my rating on this iphone charger.  The charger does charge the phone so it gets a couple stars for that.  Nitpicks that prevent the charger from rising above two stars relative to competition:-Size:  The charging unit is big and bulky (no kitchen counter for this one).-Lighting:  There is a light on the unit that is too bright.  If kept in the bedroom at night the light is distracting and had to actually be covered up.-Talk While Charging:  If your phone is dead you can't talk on the phone while it is charging from what I can tell.-Phone Cover:  You have to use the phone cover but people report that voice sounds muffled when talking on the phone with the cover on it.-Pricey:  Expensive there are other alternatives that perform better for lower price.
2	First off let me start off by saying that I totally understand the novelty of this product and others like it.  Charging multiple devices is one of those things that is just not very elegant.  However the myGrid is not an acceptable answer to this problem.The price of this starter kit is high -- TOO high especially considering you're only getting one clip for one device.  Then you're looking at spending another $30+ or so for each additional clip for each additional device that you want to charge.  Talk about an expensive solution!  And all that just so you can place the device on the matt instead of plugging it in.  And what happens when you switch cell phones or MP3 players in the future and your existing myGrid clip isn't compatible with your new device?  You're out the cost of the original clip and now you have to purchase a new one!I much prefer a less expensive option that gives you additional benefits: a charging station/valet.  Not only do you get the benefit of hiding all those unsightly cords and making things look nice and tidy but often you get additional storage compartments and drawers... and at a price that can't be beat when you compare it to myGrid and other power mats.  Take a look at some of the great options you have for charging stations:Mark Feldstein VL8C Charging Valet CherryMark Feldstein VL8 Charging Valet Satin Black6-Outlet Charging Valet for Handheld Electronic DevicesGadget Smarts WBP400 Classic 4 Wood Organizer & Charging Station w/Power Strip (Black)Lipper International 2112 Cherry Charging StationSome of them even come with the power strip that is hidden away.  Or just search Amazon for charging station or charging valet for more options.  :)
2	Short version:We tried to use this we really did.  But in the end my wife who was the most excited about it just took it off and went back to her cheap casecrown case.Long version:You have to remove the cover to charge your phone in the car.You have to remove the cover to be able to sync your iphone and I tend to take music and games on and off my iphone a lot.It doesn't seem like it protects your phone very much and I really didn't want to drop my phone on purpose to test it.It just seems like too many negatives for such a small positive.I would rather plug my phone into myAltec Lansing T612 Digital Speaker for iPod and iPhone (Black)when I get home.  This takes the same amount of effort charges my phone and I can listen to a movie or some music at the same time.  Its really not a related product but I like charging that way so much more...
2	The unit works OK but i find it a hassle to have to put the phone in the poorly fitting case.
0	We got this charging station thinking it would save us from the octopus tangle of wires we have on our desk but alas we found it to be just as frustrating.  The idea behind this station is simple - one plug multiple phones can be charged but what Duracell does not mention is that that for each phone you want to charge you must have a special clip.  This clip is supposed to be permanently attached to your phone thus making it difficult to keep in a protective cover or case.The kit is easy to use but only comes with one of these clips (this kit comes with 3 - but one is for the blackberry one is set for Motorola and the last is for use with a Nokia).  If you want to charge a second phone you will need additional clips which you can purchase separately making this set not very cost effective.While this is a great idea on paper it is certainly not well executed.  Until someone creates a power charging grid that one can simply place their phone down on with no attachments I will stick with my charging cord.
2	I was excited to receive this item (via Vine Program). I have always wanted to own something like to this to eliminate the excess cords clutter ETC. It is fairly compact and it's refreshing not to see all the various cords all over my kitchen counter. It is also pretty stylish looking which is important if it is going to sit out on my kichten counter for all to see. Unfortunately my enthusiasm waned greatly when I realized that I would have to purchase additional tips for my Ipod and my husband's Iphone. Out-of-the-boxit comes with 3 tips that will work for BLACKBERRY Pearl 8100 Series Curve 8300 Series 8800 Series and Bold Series. It also works with MOTOROLA RAZR RAZR V3 series MOTOQ Series as well as W385 + W370. Finally there is a tip for NOKIA E71 Series 2610 6085 6555 6061. With the popularity of the Apple Iphone and Ipod it is almost unfathomable that it does not include a tip for either/both of those gadgets. The retail price is over $75 which seems absurd give that I can only charge my Blackberry phone without purchasing additional tips. To summarize it's a great concept (I love how it turns off automatically if anyone touches it) but it is way too overpriced in my opinion especially without the inclusion of some other tips.
2	I remember reading awhile back about energy usage in the near future--specifically about charging our devices without the need for wires.  Envision being able to install ceiling lights without having to dig out the ceiling.  One of the features mentioned in the article was the ability to charge your ipod cell phones gps device etc. all by leaving them on a single charging pad.  So I was really excited to see the Duracell mygrid on the Vine program.But my excitement quickly faded when faced with the reality of a technology in its infancy.  The charging pad seemed as unwieldly as a mass of chargers anyways.  At least if I plug in a power bar to the outlet I could charge five different devices (yes with wires everywhere) in a small corner jumbled together.  The myGrid actually demands horizonal space!  I'm sorry but in my house flat surfaces are in high demand whether it's in the kitchen dining room or office.  I knew that this grid would take up valuable space from other objects or that the grid itself would end up being covered by paper or something or other.  Moreover despite violating the injunction against taking up flat surface space in my home it does so only so that it can charge 1 or 2 phones at a time (the grid is small)!  At least when I'm using an adapter I can unplug it and throw it in a drawer when the phone is not charging i.e. not taking up ANY space.My other beef was with the need to cover my beautiful phone with this ugly rubber case that has specialized contact points that connect with the grid in order to be charged.  first the rubber case did not look that sturdy and I didn't want to be rid of my ifrogz case that has withstood the test of a 3 year old throwing it down the stairs.  Moreover I found it unduly burdensome to have to buy a separate rubber case for every single device that I'd like to charge on the myGrid.  Finally the case was pretty ugly.I think that this technology is going to rock in a decade or so.  I think that early adopters are probably just shelling out for a nuisance though.
2	This is an elegant and simple solution to charge your iPhone.  The kit comes with a rubber case that you install on your phone. There are metal studs built into the case that bring the charge to the phone.  The case nicely protects the back and sides of the phone.  The charging plate is a thin 6 inch by 8 inch plate that plugs into the wall. When you simply set the phone on the plate it quickly recharges.  Nothing to plug in - and it looks and works great.  It is especially a good solution if you are recharging a couple phones at once - you would just need to buy more phone cases.The downsides from my perspective..... the rubber case makes it impossible to use my iPhone case that clips to my belt so I need to remove the rubber case everytime I leave the house with it. So now I use the charging plate on the weekends when I am not leaving the house with my phone - as plugging it into a charging station is easier if I am going in and out of the house a lot and having to take the cover off and on.Also extra cases are expensive - much more than just buying individual plug-in chargers - so you need to really appreciate the look and simplicity of just dropping your phones onto a plate - as the numbers don't make sense.The verdict....  this is a really good option if you are charging more than one phone (as it is expensive) and want the simplist system imaginable and don't mind using the cases that come with it.  It also looks much cooler than a traditional charging system - so you won't be ashamed to have it out on a table in the hallway. However if you already have a favorite case for your phone that fits tightly this system is not as functional and if cost is an issue there are many better options.
2	With a busy family and several phones I thought this would be a nice central charging spot for all of us.  I was surprised when I opened the box that this grid was so thin which was nice but otherwise it's not a very attractive device so I didn't want to put it in plain view.  But that is a minor point compared to the actual use of the grid.  The tips they provide are for specific types of phones although you can purchase some others but since you still have to have them hooked up to charge I'm at a loss as to what advantage this  pad provides. I imagine that it might be handy for a small business that wants to keep their phones in a central location to charge. I can't see  taking this setup with you when you travel so you still would need your regular chargers handy for those occasions.  The bottom line is that no one here wanted to add a tip or adhesive attached clip to their phone anyway so we will not be using this device since it's just easier using a regular charger.
2	Let me start by noting that I first tried aPowermat PMM-HO100 Home & Office Mat (Black)and ended up returning it. I really liked the idea of this new and greener technology (to my thinking myGrid takes less energy by using magnetic connections to one AC outlet over separate power cords to an AC outlet for each device) so I decided to try this one.It is easy to set up: plug the myGrid into an outlet place your items into the required holders place them face up onto the mat watch for the light which ensures it is working properly and wait the usual time for your item to be charged.LIKES: (1) love that this can charge up to 4 electronic devices - this is the highest I've run across in charging mats; (2) the holders are fairly easy to fit onto and remove from your cell phone which is a HUGE plus when you are talking about expensive devices; (3) the cost of additional holders are the same - $34 - for all devices where others charge more for premium brands like iPhone & Blackberry.DISLIKES: (1) this is not an easily portable device; (2) at this point has limited brand compatibility; and (3) it can be more cumbersome to fit certain cell phones into and out of a holder to charge instead of using the original charger.Like all others in this category it works for certain cell phones and not across the board. I am hoping that myGrid will branch out to include more brands to make this a better option. You will need to invest in additional holders/power sleeves so note that the end cost is higher (I would estimate at least $120).If you want the latest in technology this is a good choice.  I like it but I am not completely convinced and am still keeping my old charging cords.
0	This is one of the poorest designed products that I have seen. The price is way out of range. It only comes with one bulky thumb charger clip (and three adapters that may or may not fit your phone) that attaches on your cell phone with tape(provided). The adapters are expensive around $30. The adapters only fit a few phones and models. If I wanted to buy 4 adapters it would cost me about $120. So the charging grid cost about $70 and 4 adapters about $130 total price to charge 4 phones around $200.I had a Motorola phone that it did work with but I had to tape the thumb clip to it and found that it was too bulky to carry in my pocket. I have since switched to a Samsung phone and they are no adapters that fit the Samsung.I do NOT use this product and now it is cluttering up my closet waiting to be discarded. This product is so poorly designed and priced too high that only Duracell would choose it market it. This product is too much trouble to deal with...and I rarely write a one star review. Do not buy this product. Look for other grids or wait for improvement on design and price to go down.I bet Amazon and other retailers are flooded with returns. Shame on Duracell for trying to push this good idea but poorly designed product!
2	When it has came down to our busy lives we are honestly looking for new innovative ways to charge up our electronics from our cell phones and MP3 Players. While Duracell has made honestly some of the strongest ways we simply can find to charge up our hi-tech gadgets their always is something that isn't worth its money. For Duracell they have had some great inventions but there honestly can be one device that isn't worth its money. For Duracell's My Grid Starter Kit it can connect and charge as many as 4 favorite devices from cell phones and Ipods' but honestly it feels more like a waste of the money. It does the job noblely well but you'd have to buy added clips inorder for you to charge extra electronic devices like the Nintendo DSi or Sony PSP. For that alone it does feel more like a loss of money out of your pocket. Overall they have compact chargers that you can charge from your laptop computer that are more worth the dollars and charge. I suggest you get one of those instead.Price: C-Convience: C-Overall: C-
2	This thingy mijiggy is OK. It does have a pretty good case that has the integrated charger. This is really the way to look at it. If you sync your iPhone often or don't mind plugging it in to charge - then this is not for you. If you want a pretty good case and a drop it on the counter charging station - then this is your deal. Other wise - just keep your cash and plug it in when you get home.
2	I love the idea of being to just put my phone down and having it automatically charge withoout the need to hook it up to a computer or a power cord.  I was excited to give the Duracell myGrid kit a try so quickly opned it up when I received it.The package contains one case for your Iphone a power cord and the charging station/power mat.  I setup the power mat on a table where I would normally keep my phone when I am not charging it and then proceeded to put the case on my phone to test it out.  As described place the phone down (with the metal contacts on the case facing down) and the phone automatically charges.  Very eay to do and chraging is fast.  However I have several items that make this product not work for me for everyday use.First off the cash that comes with the kit is of decent quality and it looks like it will hold up fairly well however I prefer my Otter Box case for my Iphone protection.  Its just better qulaity and protects more.  Unfortunately in order to ge the phone to charge you must use their case.  This means taking off my Otter Box case everytime and then putting it back on when the phone is done charging.Second even if I wanted to use their case it has one major flaw in my eyes...the case completely covers the bottom plug/section of the phone which means you have to remove the case anytime you want to sync your phone or plug it into a regular adpaptor.  Since I am forced to charge my phone several times a day due to heavy use this means I would need to have my protective case off more often than it reamins on.  Not prectical for me.  I wish they could figure out a way to keep the bottom plug open rather than have the case plugged into it with no access...maybe some kind of adaptor???Finally the case does make it hard to get access to other bttons on the phone like the top main button and the side volume controls.  It just doesn't provide enough of an opening  to make it easy to adjust.  Not a hige deal but still annoyingI like the concept but think we need to see a few more iterations of this before I would recommend it.  Also to add a seocnd case cost like $35 or so.  Too much!!  and there is no way you are fitting 4 Iphones on one tray!!
2	I was really looking forward to this one.  The IDEA is there but needs perfection.I was (foolishly) hoping for some thing that you could place any device on and PRESTO! it would charge small devices.  It is configured to to offer tips to support BlackBerry Nokia and Motorola phonesand a power clip that allows you to place the supported device on the mat.Set-up is easy and the packaging is nice enough. As configured the starter kit will not support Apple ipod Touch or iPhone ( though there are kits to do so)After one gets over the fun of of just dropping a device on the mat you do remember that you need the tip the power clipand wonder if this is all that more convienient than simply plugging in a standard charger.On the plus side you certainly will delight and dazzle others by being an early adopter of what certainly will be the NEW way to charge things. Just be sure you have the supported device or add-on kit! I can assure you that if you have one people will want to look at it and 100% of the time want to try it. It is one of those wow that's COOL items.My guess is that in a few years this kind of charger will be the standard.  You will see devices that are pre-set to allow charging in this way. I look forward to that.If you are considering this as a gift as of December 2009 the Duracell myGrid system is cutting edgeand unique. The product has been highlighted on several morning shows and correctly been noted as a gadget-guru-pick.  I do consider this product to be a work in progress but it still would be most welcome to any tech-savvy person. (who has everything)It is not a cheap item nor is it horridly expensive - I have seen it at higher-end retail outlets for more and one -- a whole lot more.Must-have? No.  Really want? Yes without question.  A really fun item.
2	I was given the opportunity to review this item and I looked forward to it.I thought that anything that reduces the clutter of a million power cords can't be bad.  And certainly this is not a bad product at all. It just lacks good execution.Pros:1.  Design:  nice looking design to be sure.  Fairly compact (about 7 inches across by 4 5 inches wide) plus a power cord and a small blue power light.  This item turns off the power when you place your hand on it so no worries bout getting a zap of juice at all.2.  Size: You can place four items on the grid which makes it ideal for a family to power their devices if you have the right tips (more on that under cons) so it is a space saver.3.  Coolness:  this item ranks pretty high on the coolness factor.  It is a great idea always to get rid of a million different cords but....Neutral:1. Cost:  this item costs a significant amount of money.  I guess my question is why I would fork over a chunk of money to reduce clutter... money versus clutter... I think money may win out for me on this one.  Plus if I upgrade my phone I have to go and buy another tip.2.  Travel:  this item is large enough the travel is not necessarily made convenient by having this item.  This is one downside of this item.Cons:1.  Tips:  You have to have the right tip to insert into your phone headset etc. to attach it to the magnet provided so you can get juice to your device from the grid.  On the model I was provided I was given tips for Blackberry devices and Nokia but not the Blackberry mini USB.  Thus I couldn't really use the item without purchasing the correct tips for each device including one for the Blackberry Curve and and IPhone.  This is another significant cost and again the question is whether I want to spend money to save some clutter.  I am not really sure many people will want to incur a significant cost to save some clutter for different cords when this is intended for home.  Plus you will be provided with the cords for home use already when you purchase the product.Overall this is a GREAT idea.  it is just that asking someone to spend a good deal of money (it is more expensive than some of the phones your powering) is not a good design strategy.  Great idea poor execution.  It is just okay.
2	The Duracell myGrid Cell Phone Starter Kit is an interesting concept but the execution leaves a little to be desired.  It seems to be targeted at the household that has multiple cell phones (that are compatible with myGrid) to allow simultaneous charging while only using one outlet.  The other place it could catch on is in an office setting where you have a number of people with supported phones.  If you are not in these situations you will probably not find this a cost effective solution for your charging needs.  If you are still interested in the myGrid read on for my experience using it.The myGrid is easy to use overall but you need to understand why this is a starter kit.  While it comes with three tips (one each for BlackBerry Nokia and Motorola) it only comes with one power clip that will allow a device to be charged.  For each additional device you will need to purchase additional power clips separately.  It seems that intent is to insert the tip into your devices charging port and then connect the power clip permanently to your device by peeling the cover off of an adhesive strip.  I actually found the adhesive confusing as I could not imagine leaving the tip and power clip in permanently.  So I left the cover on the adhesive on the power clip.The mat itself and the ac power adapter are the only other pieces to the myGrid.  I connected the adapter and plugged it in.  The blue indicator light came on properly and went out as specified in the instructions.  I with the tip and power clip installed on my BlackBerry Curve I placed my phone on the myGrid.  The magnetic connection formed very easily and the blue indicator light lit on the mat to indicate that charging had begun.  I checked the display on my Curve and it also showed that the device was charging.After getting a complete charge I removed the tip and power clip and stored them near the mat for later use.  Users have the choice between this mode of usage and the suggested leave in by using the adhesive.  For BlackBerrys this is just not practical as the mini-USB port is also the mode of data exchange with your desktop.A special not for iPhone/iPod users:  this starter kit does not give you any support for your device.  The mat itself will work but you need to buy a separate charging sleeve.  Duracell does make a starter kit for Apple devices but this is not it.Overall the myGrid is an easy to use device but it seems to have a very small population of users who will benefit from it.  I hope that I have given you enough information to decide if it is for you.
0	The Duracell myGrid charging device is a product you want to like.  Imagine the possibilities you come home and toss your phone iPod or other device on the pad and walk away.  No wires to plug and unplug no more having several chargers plugged in the wall outlet.  A wireless home power grid truly the wave of the future.In reality though this is truly a product that is far from being ready for prime time and is not the wave of the future powergrid you would think it is.  More accurately it is an extension cord that transfers power via contacts in a totally traditional way.It ships with 3 tips that fit an infinitesimally small number of phone models.  Unfortunately not MY Blackberry nor MY cell phone.  The design of the power tips prevent them from being used on any other device than the exact model specified.There are two glaring problems that Duracell should have considered and abandoned the whole concept of a power grid.  One is that the location of the charging receptacle varies from phone to phone.  On mine it was impossible to fit it in and have it connect to the included charging adapter.The other problem is the charging adapter itself.  It is a fairly large disc that you have to glue to the back of your phone with double-stick tape.  Whaaat?  Are you kidding me?  So to make it line up with the little charging tip it is probably 90% likely to have to be glued over the phone's camera flash or rear speaker.  That's just plain dumb!Not to mention now you have a cell phone that you bought to be as small and convenient as possible that you can slip into your pocket or purse or nice leather carrying case ... but no more!  With a fragile adapter sticking out of the side or bottom of your phone plus the clunky odd-shaped stick-on disc your phone no longer fits easily into pocket purse or case and has to be handled with extreme care so the extra pieces don't break off and get lost. Plus with many phones that use a mini-USB connector that same connector may be used for headphones car speaker accessories or data access.  So you have to remove the power tip each time.  How is that more convenient than simply plugging the phone into a charging cord?You can also get an optional overpriced powersleeve for a miniscule few devices which is a rubber boot that fits over the device with an awkward hump on the back and bottom of the device.  Maybe a slightly better concept than the glue-on disc but so far I have seen them for only one model of iPod and one model of Blackberry.Another major failing of this products is that if you travel a lot you probably have to take a charging adapter with you.  You certainly won't take the power grid.  That means removing the power tip each time and reassembling it to use with the grid at home.  That would get very old after the first time.I fail to see the slightest advantage to the entire product; it's like a bad April Fools joke.  Someday someone will come up with a way to transfer electric power without wires; I understand that technology already exists.  When Duracell or someone else comes out with a power grid that doesn't need ill-conceived adapters I'll be interested.As far as the instruction manual goes it is almost non-existent.  For a product like this that most people have never used before it is severely lacking.Sorry Duracell I can't give this more than one star for interesting idea.
2	I would like this product a lot better if:1 - The case actually provided real protection for the phone (the plastic isn't exactly of the shock absorbing variety).2 - If you could charge in the car without having to remove the case (the case hogs the port and doesn't offer a piggy-back).3 - If the case allowed the user to sync to iTunes (you have to remove it first).4 - If there were 2 cases included in the starter package.This charging grid is supposed to be convenient.  I find nothing convenient about the fact that you can't sync or charge from your car without first removing the case.  This would have been a slightly better system if 2 cases came with the starter kit as having the ability to charge 2 phones from one source really would be a benefit that might outweigh some of the negatives.  However investing in a secondary case is cost prohibitive especially when the start-up costs are already pretty high.  Sorry but this compares badly against other merchants such as Powermat.
2	the case for the iphone is very thick and has these metal contacts on the back that make contact with the metal pad. Nowadays there are plenty of inductive chargers where you don't need metal on metal. It would make a much nicer look and when in your pocket no metal protrusions.in addition this case takes up the ipod dock connector and does not provide a pass-through. Therefore to sync your phone to itunes you need to take it out of the case to connect it. Maybe when apple adds wireless sync this won't be an issue but for the moment this thing is a lot more trouble than it is worth.
0	I see no reason to own this item. You first must attach a small device to your phone. If you do not leave it on the phone then every time you charge you must attach it. So why not just charge using your own device. If you leave it attached then it sticks out and I can't use my protective case on my phone. Also it only comes with devices for phones that do not fit my phone. You need to spend more money to get the connector for your phone.Forget this item. It is actually more difficult to charge your phone.
0	I was excited to get this item because I thought it would be quick easy and convenient but I was wrong. The charging tips that fit into your phone were only for motorola and nokia. I have LG which is just as big as motorola duracell doesn't even make the adapter for it as far as I could find out. The charging pad is smaller then I thought Its smaller than a mouse pad. Another dumb design is that you have to put a clip and stick it to the back of your phone like I need more bulk on it. If you don't want to adhere the clip you can spend another 35 bucks on a rubber sleeve that you can put on your phone I already have one for protection I don't need another.The whole thing works with magnets so both the clip tip and charging mat is metal and looks like it will scratch fast. I've seen connectors for the iphone and xbox 360 controllers as well as the Wii and PS3 but those parts are another investment of 40 bucks. So unless you have a Blackberry Nokia or Motorola phone with one of those mini usb style ports DONT get this! Duracell needs to go back to the drawing board and redesign it and have more charging tips included in the starter kits for LG and Samsung and iphone included!!!Pros:*Only works with Motorola and Nokia out of the boxCons:*Doesn't work with LG phones (tips not made for it)*iphones need additional attachment costing 35 bucks*Small Charging Mat Size*Other limited brand adapters cost 35-40 Dollars*Have to adhere a clip to the back of your phone
2	The picture on the box looks awesome.  I did receive this as part of the vine program at amazon so I didn't pay anything for this.  For me this isn't useful.  I have several wireless gadgets I have a kindle an iphone and samsung cell phone.  I just retired my blackberry and it charges it just fine but I don't use it anymore so it is of little use for me.  Does this work for how it is intended?  Yes.  Can you really just plop down any cell phone on here and it works no.I think that maybe the 2nd or 3rd generation of these will be awesome.  I look forward to something that will work for any cell phone.  I hate having to carry two cell phones (one for work and one for personal use) because this typically means one phone is low on charge.  Now if you have the phone models listed on this box this will work well for you if you have two of the same cell phones you are going to be purchasing another adapter for this so this will increase your cost.Maybe my expectations are just too high I know they are coming up with an iphone adapter soon.  I think buying one of those wooden boxes that can house all of your cords for now is a better deal for the money. For now for me this isn't the right cell phone charger.
0	I feel sad and guilty for ordering this item and causing environmental waste. Let me explain.The box contained one charging surface one power clip and 3 tips. 2 of the tips are for mini-USB sockets and another seemed to be intended for Nokia device. Our cell phones are Motorola but none of the tips are suitable for our phones.Charging suface: Looks cool no complaints.Power Clip: This is a thin flat tear drop shaped piece of plastic. You need one each of these things for every device you want to charge. They supply just one. You are supposed to stick (built-in pre-glued surface exists) to the back of your device. If you place your device in a holster sleeve or any other enclosure then you can just forget it. Other surface of this flat clip has contacts that touch the charging suface facilitating charging of the device.Tips: One end of the tip goes into your device and the other end contacts the power clip. The tip projects out of the device - again causing problems in inserting the device into a holster.Why this is totally useless for me:1) Doesn't work for my phones - tips don't match and we use holsters for phones.2) Only things I can charge using this device is my GPS and MP3 player. We don't charge them at home even once a week.For our purposes following product works much better:Leviton L02-49686-00W 6 Outlet Adapter Grounded White
2	In theory this product makes sense.  In practice it doesn't work that well.You plug a small adapter into the side of your phone and then you're able to just place on the recharging pad.The adapter concept is still too bulky in practice.  I have a protective case over my Blackberry and the only way to use the adapter is to remove the case - permanently.  I don't want to do that.  I drop my phone at times and I need the case there.  The convenience I gain from the recharger does not trump the protection I need for my phone.The adapter concept is severely limited.  If your phone doesn't work with the adapters provided you have to buy additional adapters.  The same is true if you want to use the recharger for other items such as wii controllers.  This ends up making this product even MORE expensive than what you initially think you're going to pay.Lastly it's not clear what phones work with this recharger.  For example they say the Blackberry Curve will work with it . . . but there are models of Curve that don't.  All of this needs to be spelled out more clearly.If this charger cost about 25 bucks I'd say consider it if it works for your specific phone and you don't have a need for a protective cover on your phone like I have on my Blackberry.  The outside adapter is OK in terms of size.  Not ideal but acceptable in terms of carrying your phone around.  But in the end it just seems like a gimmick.  Easier just to buy additional adapters that work for your phone and leave them in places (car home work) where you can recharge at will.
0	This product is meant to be mistaken for an inductive charging system and has 3 major problems:1. The box says it charges up to 4 devices-- well two iPhones would just barely fit on it... so you'll not be charging 4 of those.  The power supply that comes with this is a 1A power supply and the iPhone itself needs more or less an amp to charge at full speed... so you can't charge 2 iPhones at full speed.2. When your product requires your customer to use a special case... Make sure said case is not a ill-fitting and unattractive.3.  The case must be removed to sync or charge off a normal charger.If you are willing to accept these limitations all you win is the ease of not plugging in your iPhone when you get home... Is it really that hard to do?
2	How it works: First of as stated in the description myGrid only supports Blackberry Motorola and Nokia phones (and not even all Blackberry phones). myGrid can charge up to 4 devices on the grid but each one needs its own Power Clip or a Power Sleeve. After attaching either the Power Clip or fitting the Power Sleeve over your phone you can place the devices on myGrid which has to be plugged in into an outlet. myGrid then charges all 4 devices at once.Why it's a waste of money: the package comes with only ONE Power Clip so technically you can't charge 4 devices by just buying the starter kit. Power Clips and Power Sleeves sell on Amazon for $32.19 so in order to charge the 4 devices you'll have to shell out close to $100 in addition to the $80 or so you just spent on the starter kit.I personally didn't want to keep the Power Clip on my phone all day so I had to take it off after the charge was done (Power Sleeves may be more convenient to keep on 24/7). So after you go through the hassle of plugging in the myGrid contraption fitting the clips to the devices and then taking them off once the devices is charged you've just wasted more time and effort than you would have just charging them the plain old fashioned way.All I could think of while using this gadget was what's the point here? Is it seriously so hard to charge these devices that someone would need to spend close to $180 for this contraption?
0	I like many cellphone users was really excited when this product was announced. Induction charging is the wave of the future of charging small portable devices... unfortunately Duracell's MyGrid is the stuck in the flood of the past; still using connectivity to charge devices - albeit in a clunky ugly inconvenient way.For some reason I had in my head that the unit would utilize a tiny little dongle that would contain all the components needed to charge your phone. But as I'm sure you've seen the dongle connects to a bulky round disc which houses the charging system. On the disc are charging prongs which when mated to the base mat form a circuit for charging. So rather than look around for my cellphone charger I now look around for a bulky disc not really more convenient. Of course I could tape the disc to the phone increasing the phone's girth and weight and rendering my cellphone belt useless... but again that's not really more convenient is it?Frankly I don't see a situation where anyone benefits from this device. Poorly thought out with aging tech. Avoid.
2	What if something works great just not for very long?Two star review.This charger worked great for too-short awhile.  Then it just quit working.
0	I'm not sure if it's just the one seller panasystem corporation but the product I received was indeed a Samsung charger but came with a detachable USB cable with a NON-Micro USB plug as described in the product description/picture.  While the charger could be used with one of my MicroUSB cables the cable they sent me is useless and not even worth going through the refund/return process.The charger is rated at 0.7mAh which is barely enough to charge my Galaxy phone. 1A is needed for most of today's smartphones but this charger should be enough for a bluetooth headset.  However you'll have to provide your own MicroUSB cable.Not recommended.
2	Ok product. Like the title says it breaks very easy. Does what it claims though. Quality will depend on FM reception quality.
2	Anyone considering this already well knows the dangers of driving and talking on your ever present cell phone.  No matter what kind of dexterity and alertness you may have been blessed with you are still challenging fate every time you decide to talk on the phone and drive.  A tree or a telephone pole is just begging for your acquaintance the whole time.  I picked up one of these Jupiter Jacks (stupid name) at a local discount store here.  I drive a car with a stick shift that makes it extra hard to hold onto a phone and shift at the same time.  For starters let me say that the Jupiter Jack (JJ) is a very well thought out unit in its design.  It mounts easily just about anywhere while at the same time it is not so big and intrusive that it either gets in the way or should spoil the looks for those of us more fashionably minded about our cars. It also has a good universal design for holding just about any kind of cell phone and it comes with a variety of jacks for fitting your particular phone.  The set up with your radio should take about 5 minutes once you have installed in on your dash.Unfortunately when it comes to JJs actually doing what it is supposed to do the show is pretty much over after the above opening number.  Despite the commercial on TV offering the impression that it pretty much transmits through your car radio as easily as a local station it doesn't come through any where near that clearly in real use.  The signal does pretty much what cell phone signals do when you are driving around talking.  They fade in and out and draw static here and there.  Only with the JJ it happens that much more often.  When I installed mine I took a drive for about 30 minutes and called several people.  None of the calls were what I would label a success or came off as much of an improvement on JJs claims.  Two of the calls withered and died and I had to call them back the old fashioned way.  Even when the JJ completed a call the sound quality coming from the speakers was not any where near the fidelity of your regular stations.  Not really full of static but somewhat cheap and hard to decipher.  I really didn't make any distinction between the quality of calls being disrupted by stronger signals close by or just JJ being a piece of junk.  Contrary to what the commercial I have seen says my unit had two different frequencies that you could choose from.  That may help those that are being interrupted by stations horning in on your signal but it will not improve the technology of the JJ which is unfortunately not that good.In conclusion the JJ is a very good idea that has your safety and convenience in mind.  Whether you decide to take a chance on this unit or not you shouldn't be driving and talking at the same time.  But as far as recommending the JJ it's my opinion that in most cases you will be sorely disappointed.  You will most likely find its habit of working and then not dropping out and even when it is as its best being a disappointment anyway too much of a pain and end up going back to your bluetooth or other ear phone system.  I believe that after using this any required wires hanging around your front seat won't seem all that bad.  My take is pass this up...
2	I didn't like this. I tried useing it a couple of times and then went and bought a bluetooth. I gave them away at a yard sale.
0	I've tried three of these items ... from two different sellers. None of them worked with the mike in my headset (which does work as I've tested it with both an iPhone and a PC). Candidly I despise Samsung's use of  proprietary port that is used for both charging the phone and connecting a headset. The seeming inability to get a working adapter just adds to the frustration. I'm going back to my bluetooth earpiece with this Samsung phone.
0	This battery i though it came in excellent condition but it turns that it was defective came out damaged with some round form in the middle and wont turn my phone
0	I watched the bad reviews but was hopeful because of some of the positive ones.  I have an ancient RAZR that drives me crazy because it's always out of juice.  Well this was a complete waste because even with this new battery -- charge lasts less than 24 hours.  ugh.save yourself the time and money.  buy locally and return the battery if it doesn't work....like this one.
2	the worked for 3-4 months in comparison to the originna batttery that lasted over the first year of purchase. had to be replaced as well
2	literaly just opened it and it was broken at the top... love it just doesnt look good BROKEN :/ DONT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!
2	It works fine with the Samsung to download the content from the phone onto the computer. I recommend it for Samsung Phone.
2	While you can get an iPhone 5 into this case it's extremely tight (too short). On top of that the belt clip while it seems very sturdy is very hard to get on and off my belt. I do like the velcro closure of the flap. It makes me a lot more secure knowing that my phone is not likely to slide out but the case is simply too small for an iPhone 5 to slide into or (much worse) remove from this holster. Having said all this I must qualify this a bit. My phone does have a case on it so this could very well be the cause of my difficulty with this holster. But if it were just maybe 1/4 longer and the belt clip just slightly more loose it would be perfect. As it is it's useable just not easy.
2	Haven't tried it yet hopefully it will hold a good charge. waiting for my charging box and cable then i can put it to the test.
2	There's really not a lot you can say about this it's a cable.  It has the mini-connector on one end and the other is a USB connector.  I used it to put music on my wife's phone and it worked the way it was supposed to.
0	The cable actually does work just not with Windows 7. It's a Pantech driver issue. I didn't try it on an XP machine but if you have a windows 7 system this is not the way to transfer your media to/from computer. Suggestion use an SD card if possible.
0	I don't know what the devil this cable is for that was sent to me but it definitely doesn't even resemble the picture and it most certainly is not for a Pantech P7040P phone. It had two male usb ports of one end and a one female port on the other. It appears to be used to enable two two usb devices to be plugged into one port. Not the right item that I ordered.
2	cheap and works well for a few months but stops working or starts getting a loose connection after only 5-6 months.
2	This charger worked only for one month.  After a month it would not charge my phone anymore.  I am not satisfied with this product.
2	I've had this car charger now for about 6 months and although it does have a more rapid recharge rate than other chargers I've seen the connection to my android phone has become erratic.  The connection is now loose and will only charge my phone if I hold it in at a certain angle.  No other connectors that I have do this so I have ruled out my phone as the problem.  Sucks...
2	It generally works but every car I've tried it in has me wiggling it around in the socket to get power.  It could just be the sockets in modern cars but I doubt it.
0	just got today tried 2 different usb adapters and tried from the pc but none of them charge my phone....  if i could give negative stars i would!
0	This case should not be on the market.It honestly is not worth a quarter.The case is so thin and flimsy.The rhinestones are barley attached.Before I opened it I could see there were missing rhinestones already.I returned this the next day.DO NOT BUY!
2	I really enjoyed this case but after a few weeks the stones started falling out.  It was fun while it lasted....
0	Case makes phone difficult to hold in hand. Does not protect the phone at all and leaves little stones all over the place.
2	Looks nice until the sparkles start falling off - which was shortly after I starting using it.  When they do fall off it looks liks a &#34;tack&#34; base like old gum...
0	This cover was a gift for my daughter but it wouldn't stay on her phone.  The plastic tabs didn't click together at all.
2	not worth buying because when there isnt a single jewel left it looks gross. i threw mine out. i wouldnt recommend it.
0	after the first 3 days it all cracked up turned a little bit yellowish although it fits perfectly the quality of materials is not the best
0	It is not transparent and it was very flimsy. This case did not meet my expectations I used it it cracked and I trashed it.
2	this case only covers the back of the iphone! the chrome border is still exposed thus it's prone to damage. the case also makes it hard to press the volume button. overall it's a cheap decent case.
2	This case looks cool but that's where it stops. This case cracked the first time i put it on and after a week it had cracks in all four corners. Its also great at collecting dust and grit. I suggest you try something like this:KingCase iPhone 3G & 3GS * Rubberized Slim Slider Twist Case (Navy Blue & Black) 8GB 16GB 32GB.
0	shipping cost is 5 times the price of the product and I thought it was free because I bought others more than 50$...the case just a normal transparent plastic
2	This phone case only came with the back no front included. Was not happy with the product. Would not recomment this  for other customers.
2	Just an ok case.offers no protection. I bought two and both broke in less than a month. You get what you pay for I guess
2	I bought mine at radioshack for $64.** about a year ago.  Very nice packaging nd display of the product.  Other then that this is not a good or even an ok noise cancelling bluetooth.  Everyone I call complains bout static in the background.  It also has an awful echo.  On a windy day everyone I call ends up hangup on me because all they hear is background noise.  The built in command system can not even hear you.  Then it guess what you said 9 out of 10 times.  Do not waste your money keep shopping around there has to be something better.
2	I bought this product and it arrived very promptly...once recieved it worked very well and I liked it but about three weeks after usage the tip part connecting the earpiece and the ear cushion had broke off but I just super glued it and it worked for about a month after then it broke again but only in a different place. Between date of purchace and March of 2012 that thing had so many patch jobs untuil it was unrapairable...i am contacting the seller today to see if the will replace this inferior version of a quality product. Keeping my fingers crossed!
2	I have a Plantronics Voyager 520.  I recently got a new cell phone that does not have as good of a Bluetooth system as my older one so I thought I'd try to see if a newer more expensive Bluetooth would work better with it.  Nope.  I have been using this BlueAnt model now for a few days and I'm stopping now.  I'm tired of restating everything on the phone and people I know complaining that sound quality is crappy.  The Voyager 520 costs about 1/2 or less what this one costs and it's quite superior on sound quality coming and going.  I can highly recommend the voyaber 520 and I cannot recommend this BlueAnt model at all.  I do not understand how it has gotten as good of ratings as it gets in computer magazines.In addition to sound quality the buttons are poorly placed on this BlueAnt model.  Essentially the on/off/call button and the volume up and down buttons are right where you want to touch the thing to get it settled in your ear (also something the Plantronics model does better).  It's annoying to activate things just by trying to get it better situated in your ear.
2	I have had several bluetooth devices and this one by BlueAnt was one of the best. Not only was I able to hear clearly even if I was in a crowded store (you can adjust from 2 settings to maximize) but most importantly of all to me - it was incredibly comfortable. So comfortable that I forgot it was in my ear.So why the 2 stars? Because despite being very careful with the way I took care of it  I have only had it a few months and it broke on me. It just sheared off right at the tip. I came here to read some reviews thinking maybe this was a fluke and I would order another and see that others have complained about this very thing.This really isn't acceptable and this was an expensive bluetooth and I expected better. I'm not sure what to get now but if anyone has any recommendations I'd love to hear them.
2	I've had mine since January 2010 & it worked really well for me but.....The rubber earbud pieces fall off very easily so I lost a few of the ones it came with the foam one that came attached to it would shoot out of my ear without warning and finally the stem that the rubber ear bud hooks onto broke into several pieces when I went to put it in my ear a few days ago. The unit itself still worked. I had bought it from the AT&T corporate store so I brought it back to them. They no longer carry this but did an even exchange for the Q2 which sells for the same price I paid for the Q1 ($129). When I opened it up today I see the Q2 has a different design for the stem which hopefully will be sturdier & a felt pouch for it. I would recommend the Q1 for the low price Amazon is currently selling it for but not for the significantly higher price I paid for it. I used my Q1 a lot - for at least 4 hours a day at least 5 days a week.
0	I was very disappointed in this product for my Droid. My calls were tinney and staticy and the update wouldn't work on my computer and customer service couldn't seem to help me. The fit was comfortable enough but I'm looking for a lot more that in my BT! I was thinking the voice commands would be great but it misunderstood me more times than not so it was frustrating. I went back to my Icon.
2	When I purchased this set the description stated that the case was Rubberized Hard Case. I also ordered the identical set in blue. What I received was the correct blue case but the soft silicone black case. From all of the reviews I knew I didn't want this so I submitted an email to correct the error. I was told that I would receive a tracking number for the correct shipment in 48 hours but 4 days later I haven't heard anything. My wife is using the hard cover on her phone and it seems pretty decent. I wouldn't want to bother with the silicone one at all. The USB cables are relatively useless unless you want to just use them as chargers. The screen protectors actually aren't bad. No matter how careful you are there will be some bubbles but they can be worked out. I'd rather have this screen protector on than not. I haven't used the car chargers yet but they do fit into the phone correctly at least. I'll update the review once the case issue is resolved. I do not recommend buying this set with the silicone case unless you're only buying it for the other items. The hard case is much more effective.Update: After asking again through Amazon.com they did respond that the correct item was being shipped along with pre-paid shipping to return the incorrect item. This indeed happened and I now have the correct hard rubberized case which I am enjoying thoroughly. If you want the hard case do not place the order if the description is for the soft one.
0	Didn't fit very well and basically was a dust collector. I tried everything to get it tighter but nothing worked. Don'twaste your money. USB cable was garbage and so was the car charger.
2	Bought it for the price and the design  didn't like the snapping of the covers.  It was hard to put on and remove. Bought it for the moment just to get by.
0	It didn't work at all because it didn't fit well. Never used it What more is there to say other than it didn't work.
2	It is ok it Works for what it says protect hehehe. The case fit well with the BB. I prefer the silicone cases.
2	I ordered these basically because they were cheaply priced and am sad to say they are cheaply made as well... I mean the plastic part seemed fine they just don't stick or stay put for long at all (day or two)... I don't like giving bad reviews but am just being honest; spend a couple more bucks and get one that will stick/last (maybe that's why they give you 3?)!!
2	I purchased this phone hoping that it would be the end-all high-powered do-everything cell phone with computer functionality.However what it is...is a high-powered COMPUTER with somewhat awkward cell phone functionality. Straight away some might say well buy a simple telephone. Nay... I say to you Nokia ought to be able to deliver it all - not parts of the puzzle. It should do it all and it is close but not quite there - yet.The problems with the cell phone functionality begin with a strange requirement to swap back-and-forth between landscape and portrait (a 90-degree movement of your hand) in order to initiate a phone call. This is obviously an oversight from the software developers who (apparently) were too busy designing the high-powered computer functionality of this device.Another problem... the phone is extremely slick. It's easy to drop. On the other hand the device is extraordinarily beautiful - a work of art. However I couldn't figure out what type of case would protect it yet not impede functionality. I didn't find a solution.Otherwise the computer functions were amazing. And Nokia's Ovi-store is nice even if most of the apps are not quite what I was looking for. Nokia will get there.If you're a computer geek (e.g. MS) and like tinkering with computers to make them work - this is for you. However if you enjoy an easy-to-use powerful interface that needs no human interference to just - work you might not be very satisfied with this Nokia product.We own three other Nokias: E71 and two E63s. All three are solid and function great as advertised. However I cannot recommend the Nokia N900 to anyone who first wants a cell phone and 2nd robust smart phone functionality - no matter how powerful and amazing its computer within may be.I returned the phone.
2	Ok so many detailed and well writen reviews are here so what I'm going to do is tell you my personal experience with this phone that I've been using for a month and a half now.When I first got the phone I had a very HARD time with it restarting by itself when using the Internet or when using more than 2 applications at a time.  Within a Nokia forum I found out that it was because of the firmware that the phone came with (not totally tested I guess) and that was why I almost threw it to the wall more than one time as I was sick of having a brand new phone that restarted itself every time I used it.Thanks to that forum I found a way to go around and manually fix the problem and it was really solved.  Then came the firmware update and finally the phone was working fine using Nokia factory configurations (not a manual fix).About the good stuff on this phone: it was made to work as a little computer on your hands which is great since it has several applications (not so many) to work with and customize it.  The Internet browsing it IS like you were seating on your on PC/laptop if you go to youtube or facebook or amazon etc you will not enter the mobile sites but to the actual site.When making a call I've had several volume issues I've took the volume to the limit and if I'm in a noisy environment I have a hard time hearing the other person.  Even worse is the speaker phone I really don't know why since the stereo speakers sound great if you play music or videos but not when using it for a call (lack of volume).The video quality is amazing I actually connected my phone to my LCD TV and watched a couple of widescreen movies.  The music player is nice too I haven't used playlists but the phone itself categorize the music by 4 categories that are very useful most of all the never played category.The keyboard well it is nice but as many others had said you have to get used to the space bar on the right side not in the middle.  The keyboard also may get slided accidentally when handling the phone to take a photo.  About the camera it works pretty cool to it has several settings that are useful.  I can't comment more on this since I did not buy the phone because of the camera I don't really use it like some others.  In addtion I haven't found out how to copy and paste when browsing since you cannot use the pencil to select text then copy and paste it elsewhere.About disk space touchscreen usage and resolution this is where this phone starts to be a competition to the iphone and so many other phones.  32GB is enough space to put my favorite music and movies I can't say applications since there aren't so many apps for maemo yet.  The touchscreen is beautiful the 4 different workspaces make the phone very interesting since you may customize one for business one for fun/media one for internet related stuff and another one for whatever you may like.Personally I like to have custom ringtones for several contacts but Im still unable to do this with this phone... :(Now even that the phone is beautiful fast and very useful what I still don't like is the size weight and grip of it.  Don't take me wrong I was not expecting a lightweight phone with all the features it has BUT this is way to heavy and bulky for me and that is one more reason for me to rate it 3 stars (IT IS OK).
2	I wasn't happy with my T-Mobile G1 and was intrigued by the Nokia N900.  I made the jump and now have gone back to the G1 appreciating it all the more.Typing on the N900 is a horror. I thought the G1 keyboard was small -- the N900 makes the G1 feel like a classic Northstar. Now that might seem like a small quibble. It's true that the screen is larger the resolution greater the camera a real point-and-shoot replacement the radios are strong... but you're going to be using the keyboard a LOT with an N900. The apps aren't quite there yet. You're going to be doing a great deal of gluing and crafting to get things to run at first -- expect to spend time in the root shell. For a programmer that's not so bad... but coupled with a bad keyboard it's a deal-breaker.As a test show me how to make a percent sign on the hard keyboard of an N900. I'll save you the trouble you can't make one. You have to light up the symbol table and choose it on-screen.What's more painful to me is the glacially-slow updates to the Nokia software especially when compared to Google. Ovi Maps should have been turn-by-turn for N900s already... where is this? Why is MMS support an add-on? Why is rotation such a difficult task on this device?  microUSB?  Really I have to go get more adapters and cables now?  At least a 3.5mm headphone jack is there.By punting this over to developers Nokia is saying that they cannot solve your problems. They aren't leading in the space. Moreover the muddled roadmap is killing them. Developers want minimal targets and Nokia keeps changing the targets. OS2006-8 Maemo Meego... sorry NoGo. EasyDebian is an interesting *TOY* it's not the end game not with all the difficulty around porting existing apps to be functional on a small screen.Here's the minimum Nokia needs to succeed with this device with this platform and program:-one target roadmap fully detailed and predictable;-more frequent shipping of code even in point releases to develop a culture of success progress and momentum;-crushing the outstanding UI issues and expected functionality complaints by delivering;-provisioning real ARMEL tools to get as many existing Debian apps onto their platform as possible.In short they have to make it as easy as Android development and give devs a single SDK target. There's too much flux too much unsettled and the N900 reflects that.  I wish this phone was more polished I do.  I might have been able to accept the awful keyboard if it had more finished functionality but in the end it's going back.--#
0	[Edit - Jan 24 2010 Update:Two firmware updates a couple weeks ago so after testing time for an update: If you NEED bluetooth like I do and don't plan to carry two phones/devices to have bluetooth available read on.So little progress has been made and I have seen far too many bugs/enhancements closed as WONTFIX that I am dropping this to 1-star based on current state 2 updates and price to value in comparison with other devices that have launched/will launch in the next month or so. I'll change the rating depending on next update - length of wait will be factored in. I see a lot of bashing for people who give low reviews so I expect I'll hear about this.I'll start by quoting Nokia from bug 6766 regarding bluetooth problems on the phone. This came after the major PR1.1 update:As far as making all issues go away I don't think that's physically possible since Bluetooth and WLAN share the same antenna in the N900. Some WLAN operations such as searching for access points take over the antenna almost completely.All the bluetooth bugs still exist some are made worse by PR1.1.Note: regardless of what people say there is NO way zero none nada to turn off the wifi radio via graphical interface. You can probably do so via CLI if you are very advanced with Linux and not worried about re-flashing but that's not practical. You can take several steps to make it less active but it is still running - easiest to see is choose Internet Connections from the status area and it will show all wifi APs even though you think it is disabled. Nokia closed an enhancement request to allow customers to fully disable the wifi radio as WONTFIX.The major update of the two known as PR1.1 was eagerly awaited and expected to fix a lot of problems including the well known very active bluetooth bugs. Nothing I listed has been addressed and the firmware addressed a few minor things overall-nothing major. Important to note that the manifest list posted for PR1.1 lists A LOT of bugs as fixed that were actually fixed before the phone was released. I have noticed a lot of people's tones have changed since the disappointing update.PR1.1:Bluetooth: The PR1.1 update did help some who had a lot of issues with 'stuttering' on bluetooth (music and calls). For most of us it didn't. One person who initially seemed happy and said he'd live with it came back a day or two later and said it's not fixed. Long story short read bug 6766 on maemo's bug site. For me and others PR1.1 has increased disconnections to a point that I don't bother trying to use BT now. It essentially disconnects immediately. When I was testing PR1.1 a couple times the connection lasted several minutes but the majority is instant disconnect. If you need bluetooth I would hold off.Portrait mode: They are working towards it that's good. The browser has a partial implementation now (it's nice for one handed reading good formatting but not complete). Tip: you have to hit a combination of shift+ctrl+O to activate it; it works with keyboard slider in only. To disable shift+ctrl+O again. However I have 'remnants' of the future with my desktop sticking in portrait randomly requiring a restart. Not a huge deal unless you are in a hurry to make a call.USSD codes: The *#nnn#nnnnnn# to do many controls on your phone like say enable full forwarding since it is not available in the interface or check prepaid balance etc. etc. They fixed a couple codes: show your IMEI and show the software version (both available in settings | 'about phone' right next to each other). They closed this bug as fixed - a lot of very unhappy people on this one. I think Nokia (well probably Maemo since they don't know phones yet) really underestimated how important this is - it is clear from the huge bug thread that a lot of the codes people need are surprising to them.Maps: It starts up a little quicker. A few minor tweaks that aren't worth mentioning. I was hoping I could at least do routing to an address. You can but open your browser and go to google maps.Anything else I don't mention there is nothing to mention. It was an underwhelming update that decreased battery life further addressed several small issues. Some had ZERO votes and only 1 person involved with the ticket and it was very small - e.g. RDS name in the FM transmitter???. Clearly poor prioritization.Other stuff: The battery charges much faster now but it also drains much faster. There are some great apps starting to show in the pipeline. A lot of hard work from the community going on and new things are showing up daily in devels and testing repositories. They just aren't hitting extras (production) fast enough.BTW - my review is not meant to be 'negative' - I am simply stating known issues that a potential buyer may not know. I just haven't repeated the positive or taken the speculative position of hoping to see the potential realized. My intent is very simple: provide a different view that isn't one of infatuation that simply repeats the specs on the Nokia site. Provide information that would have had me think twice before purchasing. I know what you might be thinking: would I repurchase it now? No. Not then and not now.End update]---------------------------I've had the N900 over a month so I'm familiar enough with the N900 now to write comfortably.I had high expectations and loved the N900 for the first 2-days. Every day since I've grown more disappointed. I should have sent it back for a refund w/in the first couple weeks (pre-ordered from Nokia). But I was optimistic on the potential which has withered as I've watched Nokia/Maemo do not-so-amazing things on [...]. The N900 is not complete - not even close. They've left out a lot of what we have grown to love and expect with other current smartphones (this really doesn't qualify as a tablet). Time on[...] has me very discouraged. They are very focused on Maemo 6 and it's obvious they consider Maemo 5 primarily in maintenance mode.I am still amazed that they released the N900 as is. Bugs I expect but I didn't expect it to be missing some very basic features that are now standard. I also didn't expect them to turn actual bugs into low priority enhancements or completely dismiss them as WONTFIX.---------------------------------------Some quotes from Maemo/Nokia on [...]:If the reporter expects the feature to be officially supported then it is a WONTFIX [common comment]I think I can resolve this as WONTFIX entirely since the feature can be perfectly covered by the community. [This is to create a function to disable/enable wifi]Isn't Settings -> About a more user-friendly way to look up the same? [This is about the lack of support of using USSD codes - simply weird]---------------------------------------One review mentioned it's built with steel aluminum rubber and plastic. Wish I could find more than plastic. It is very 'plasticky' feels fat heavy and it looks cheap - nothing like the picture. It looks & feels like a digital camera you might have purchased 5-years ago. How did DROID get essentially the same internals into such a thin form factor and Nokia managed to make it look 10-years old?There are many positives about the N900 (and it does have strong *potential*). Many were written about. I won't re-write them. However I will note many 'gotchas' that you would not expect from a 'flagship' phone from any manufacturer. The aggregate of the gotchas add up to borderline unusable (in my opinion). I'm not going to list everything but will put down what would have me think twice about buying. I should have waited for an update or two. I can't say it looks promising though.Below are known issues. One is not confirmed by Maemo/Nokia but the majority are WONTFIX or being left to the community (i.e. not Maemo/Nokia) - with a couple pushed for *consideration* for Maemo 6 (Harmattan). Bluetooth they think may be fixed in a future update. USSD codes they seem to be looking at (but haven't seen a confirmation of fix).I have noticed Nokia leaves it for the community to implement many basic features. Why would they bother with basic features for one of the most expensive phones out there? Even if you want an open platform and are familiar with Maemo you wouldn't (least I don't) expect them to push so much to be done by the community. Android doesn't take things that far - sure it's 'mostly' open but they package the basics with the Android builds.- OS: It appears Fremantle (Maemo 5 that comes on the N900) is essentially in maintenance mode already. I've spent weeks on[...] and watched as they apply WONTFIX to many basic features that were reported as missing marked true bugs as enhancements and low priority (e.g. doesn't allow you to use USSD codes - *#...#) sent enhancement requests to their brainstorming site and many requests they accept are assigned to *possible* Harmattan (Maemo 6) inclusion.What does this mean? It's possibly outdated already.- LINUX: Better know Linux. Due to the lack of settings and missing granularity in those that exist you'll need to know Linux to make many changes/check certain settings. If you do it's just a pain to make changes via the terminal rather than using a GUI.- SETTINGS: There are very few settings. The settings that exist have very little granularity. No easy wifi on/off only two profiles (general and silent) with very little available to configure. Click 3-4 times just to change the display brightness. No way to set a 'home' desktop that you and I are used to -nor is there a way to get to a particular desktop easily besides using both hands and swiping. Plenty more.- BLUETOOTH: Nearly unusable. There are two major known issues: 1) it uses the same antennae as WiFi so if you have wifi on (takes 7-steps to disable it fully) bluetooth headsets are unusable: too much static heard on both ends A2DP music has static and pauses file transfers run around 20kbps and disconnect often. 2) Constantly disconnects. Live in a state/country where you must use hands-free while driving? Don't like holding the phone to your ear for long calls? Want to type while on the phone? Want mobility while you talk? You can't. It disconnects anywhere from instantly to several minutes. Upon disconnection the sound doesn't transfer to the handset. It normally takes a power cycle to get things reoriented.- WIFI: Looking for an easy way to disable wifi when not using it? Sorry we're not talking 1-2 steps for Android or 3 for iPhone it takes 7-steps to disable (you have to assume it's disabled - no way to tell if the radio is off and maemo/Nokia haven't said for sure) and re-enable. Reported as a bug on [...] - they consider it an enhancement pushed it off to Harmanttle as possible inclusion and said they'll let the community write something for Maemo 5 (nothing in the pipeline as of this writing). Hope you don't need to disable/enable wifi often.- BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD: Sorry. Several other smartphones support but the N900 doesn't. I have an N810 and many of us expected the N900 to take its place as a tablet but with a phone. Nokia/Maemo's official response? Not supported it and it won't be. They've marked several submitted bugs on this as WONTFIX. There is a way to get a BT keyboard to pair (if you know Linux) but don't bother it doesn't support typical PC-105 layout and only some letters will work.- LANDSCAPE: I didn't think landscape would be that bad. It supports portrait in phone (if you can get it to move to portrait) but that's it. It is a BIG pain especially if you want to use the device with one hand. Just entering a 5-digit PIN to unlock with one hand is very difficult. It might be livable but the implementation is very poor.- MAIL FOR EXCHANGE (MfE): Far too many bugs to mention here. Barely usable - supports HTML now but a few steps backward everywhere else. I'll hit a few: Doesn't properly map fields (both contacts and calendar) doesn't synchronize updates properly doesn't seem to properly support the EAS protocol in general won't properly synch with Google's EAS implementation (they said this isn't supported) etc.- MAPS: Can't use maps without a network connection. If you download map files - still no go. Also Ovi Maps 1.0 takes ~10-minutes (sometimes longer) to locate your position. GPS is on but Maps shows it's not active much of the time. I've found no way to route to an address; only two options: point to it on a map or type in a city/state/country in a search dialog - can't search for an address. Very slow.  Pretty much useless unless you want to know you are sitting on the right couch. No clue what Nokia was thinking with this.- GPS/CAMERA: If you want proper geo-tagging you'll need to buy another device. GPS on but photo is not tagged. It will tag sometimes if you have network positioning on.- BASICS: Are you looking for standard/basic functionality that your other phones you've had over the last few years have? The N900 is missing a lot. Far too many to list but in addition to what's already been mentioned a few are: word suggestion is poor with no auto-correct (even a standalone i is not capitalized and it doesn't work in some areas) can't use USSD codes no unconditional call forwarding can't select different ring tone for contacts can't mark contacts to automatically go to VM can't change amount of ring time before going to VM etc.- EMAIL CLIENT: Tinymail-based (not bad). Very poor implementation and the email client is very limited. Can't highlight text and copy doesn't synch any folder but inbox and sent (you can view other IMAP folders but if you delete an item - it's gone for good - no synch and no trash on N900 drafts stay on phone etc.). Maemo/Nokia are on record saying this will never happen because it's too complex (common saying[...]) but look for it in Harmattan - maybe. Doesn't auto-fill/suggest as you type a name in TO/CC/BCC. No choice to return to inbox after deleting a message - you can only view the next message.- EMAIL CLIENT: Have to confirm each and every delete. There is no option to remove confirmation. If you deal with a high volume of email it's a big irritant. It's been submitted as an enhancement request with Nokia's current response as It would be interesting to how popular such request is :-/ Weird that such basic functionality in every email client (mobile or not) that I can think of isn't on the N900 or its roadmap.Very poor email client - worst I've seen on a mobile device in years.This doesn't include all issues but the review is long enough. Hopefully it helps with a bit of a different perspective by someone who has gotten over the infatuation and spent a lot of time working with Nokia/Maemo.
2	Great if you're a nerd and love a Debian-like OS. If the thought of a command-line interface and ssh make you drool go for it. It is a great handheld terminal and works great on T-Mobile US 3G and 3.5G.Looking for a smartphone with apps? Go elsewhere.After owning one since they were released in December 2009 the following still are show-stoppers for me to recommend to my non-nerd friends:* Apps are basically only from open-source hackers. You're not going to find the depth of what is available on the iPhone or and Android phone. OVI Store is basically devoid of N900 apps of any value.* No MMS without a 3rd-party app (and then not integrated with SMS)* No iSync without a 3rd-party app* USB charging won't work from most dumb chargers such as lighter-to-USB or batteries* No distinctive ringtones* No voice dialing* GPS lock takes several minutes if at all* Maps application is total junk even if GPS locks* Will not sync with older versions of Exchange Server* Contacts with both a name and a company can't easily be searched on company* Resistive touchscreen requires a stylus for most interactions and is much harder to use than the iPhone or Andriod phones* Battery life relatively poor (I have to charge during the day if I use the browser)* FM transmitter (for car radio) close to uselessOn the upside the QWERTY keyboard is an essential for me the camera is good the browser is functional and it has Flash (thought not Flash 10).While PR1.2 update has improved some usability in many areas the OS appears to be a dead end for Nokia as their current releases are going with the Symbian line again.
2	I pre-ordered my N900 the moment I found out about it back in September. And I patiently waited and waited while watching every demo preview and review I could find. With each passing day I knew I was closer to mobile bliss. And one day my N900 arrived.Sadly it didn't really deliver.Having (briefly) owned anN97 I was incredibly disappointed to discover that Nokia has tried their hardest to port elements of Symbian phones to the Maemo platform. Once you're past the (admittedly awesome) desktop effects the N900 feels disturbingly similar to the N97 in terms of use.Mail Not Responding. Quit?If you use e-mail you're going to see this message. Using the included Mail application for Exchange and an IMAP account is painful to say the least. If you're coming from another Symbian phone you'll discover that the Mail application is every bit as slow and constrained as your old phone but does a (marginally) better job of rendering HTML messages. If you're coming from something like an iPhone or BlackBerry forget about it. Having an iPhone 3G and BlackBerry Bold as well the messaging on the N900 is infuriating.The screen is gorgeous in terms of resolution. It's trash in terms of accuracy if you aren't using the included stylus. I don't have huge fingers and yet nearly every tap is either interpreted wrong or not registered at all. Using kinetic scrolling will inevitably open something you didn't intend to open or do nothing at all. You'll find yourself asking Did I tap once or twice?.Web browsing? Brilliant. Seriously. The included web browser is every bit as good as everyone says. Pages render properly Flash works zooming in and out is excellent. If you just wanted a handheld web browser and nothing else I'd recommend this ten times out of ten.But it runs Linux! Linux Linux Linux!Sure. I consider myself to be fairly platform agnostic when it comes to phones and frankly the open nature of Maemo is something of a red herring. Yes getting applications on the N900 that aren't blessed by Nokia is relatively easy. Yes you can compile OpenOffice to work on the N900. The question really is: Will you?. In a lot of ways I can see how the N900 would be an excellent tool if I was a Unix / Linux admin who wanted the flexibility to work anywhere without a laptop or netbook. And there's a certain geek credibility that comes with doing something for the sake of doing it especially when you have such a portable platform. The N900 is great for those things. And keep in mind that's largely the audience that Nokia is targeting with the N900.For well over a decade Nokia's been known for rock-solid performance on signal and voice quality. With the N900 again they've come short. 3G call quality is decent. If you're outside of a 3G area (which is likely if you use this with T-Mobile and a certainty if you're on AT&T;) the N900 has a very difficult time maintaining a decent GPRS/EDGE signal and dropped calls are frequent. Admittedly the phone functionality is something of an afterthought from Nokia on this specific model -- but it really shows.As for carrying it around the N900 isn't quite the brick some have claimed it to be. It's definitely substantial compared to other phones available though not unreasonable to carry in a pocket. The multimedia functionality is above average capable of playing just about every type of music and movie format I could throw at it. The camera while decent is not substantially better than what you'd find in most midrange to high-end phones in terms of picture quality.Overall the N900 is a huge series of tradeoffs. For many it doesn't do... there are workarounds or will be workarounds or might be workarounds. And that's really the crux of my rating. The hardware in and of itself is not very special for a phone that costs this much. And the shortcomings may well be addressed but you have to question how much time and effort you're willing to put in to this device just to bring it at par with similarly priced alternatives. At the same time there's a lot of wishful thinking if you aren't prepared to roll up your sleeves and do some development work. Maybe Nokia will address this in a firmware update... or Maybe someone will write a script or program that does this... will be your mantras if you don't do the work yourself.***January 2010 Update***I'm now on my third N900 -- the previous two were defective.I had considered completely re-writing this review but too many aspects continue to hold true.What's different:The newer N900 is much more stable and doesn't crash nearly as often as I had described previously. That's not to say that it doesn't crash but with the newer hardware and firmware it no longer crashes if you look at it the wrong way.The developer community is reasonably active on the Maemo platform and it didn't take very long for some great apps to come out. Installing them doesn't hold a candle to what you'd find on an Android phone or iPhone but if you're familiar with CVS/SVN or can follow simple instructions getting some repositories going is a snap as is finding interesting software. I've been particularly happy with seeing open source projects like Pidgin and Keepass ported over so fast.What's the same:Mail is still pretty terrible especially if you have a large inbox. Getting the number of messages down will help to make the application more responsive however it still is a far cry from what you'd see in competing smartphones on every major platform. It also inexplicably stops updating (yes fanboys even when it's not set for off-peak hours) and the Last Updated timestamp rarely correlates to reality.The OS still needs refinement. Case in point: It simply doesn't do a good job of telling you that it's busy. Sure nobody wants to build an hourglass (or spinning beachball) in to their OS but there are times when the OS is just bogged down when you're positive the screen isn't registering taps.All things being equal I'm still going to hold to my original conclusion that the N900 isn't for the general consumer looking to out iPhone the iPhone. But for someone not afraid of rolling up their sleeves the N900 can be an amazing device for Unix aficionados and hard-core gadget geeks.Oh... and a quick tip: This car charger works perfectly with the N900 and is dirt cheap: Motorola P513 Vehicle Power Adapter MicroUSB Rapid Rate Charger
2	Overall nice design style and quality materials were used.Physically I wish the USB slot had a snap on cover like my Nokia C6 to prevent dust from getting in nice feature to have but I guess Nokia saved some money by not including this bell and whistle feature. Physically the top row of the keyboard is better spaced than the Nokia C6 (see my C6 review under my ID: Kingmonkey) which is cramped at the top so when you type your finger touches the top slider portion but here for the N900 there is more room so typing using the top row of the keyboard is more roomier. Physically again there is a lot of chatter of the N900 being a brick or bulkier and bigger than most smart cell phones. I don't think so I think the extra heft denotes quality I would say about 25% more heft than C6 (the C6 is weighty too but so is my Blackberry Bold 9000). It's only about an extra .25 thicker than the C6 and maybe .25 wider than C6 from left to right held vertically. The photos of the N900 (C6 too) make it seem like they are big phones I don't think so I can hold them in my palm just like my Blackberry Bold 9000 and my Bold is actually wider than the N900. I think the N900 is a good size and is NOT a brick or the size of a brick again it's SLIMMER than my Blackberry Bold 9000 when you compare them side by side by width although being slimmer it is thicker than the Bold 9000 by less than an half an inch. Bottom line I don't like big phones and I do not think the N900 is a big phone. It is a relatively heftier phone but dimension wise (lxw) it fits comfortably in your hand although it may weigh down a bit in your shirt pocket or pant pocket (I carry mine in its case and keep it in my bag for the most part).The software operating system is Maemo based. As such compared to the C6 Symbian op system it is a little more complicated to master/familiarize yourself with not as intuitive as my C6. It is a sophisticated system screen icons are sophisticated looking too. Image wise the N900 leaves the C6 Symbian graphics in the dust.As for the software side this is where the N900 may leave some frustrated and where most of the complaints are compared to the physical aesthetics of the N900 (people mostly complain about the size and weight of the N900 but as I said above  it is surprisingly small when I first opened up the box). For my Google calendar I had the same issue as with the C6 You can use MS exchange and set up the Nokia calendar+contacts that way but again it just populates the main calendar items (no info is populated for calendars you created such as bills holiday calendars or whatever other Google calendars you customized your calendar with on your PC Google calendar account; it also populates all Gmail contacts which I don't want since I don't want everyone I email to be a my N900's personal contact list; I suppose there is an option to choose to populate contacts only calendar only but I don't remember pretty sure I saw something like that though. Anyway deleted the calendar and contacts for the reasons stated once I tried using MS exchange to install Gmail calendar and contacts. Instead like what I did for the C6 for the Google calendar I bookmarked the google mobile calendar and use this to access my calendar via the web on the N900. For contacts in the N900 phone book I enter them myself and personalize this way linking a photo to each name if I want.Now as for linking Gmailthe details . . . what a hassle! (mind you I have an undergraduate AND graduate degree in economics an MBA work in finance (analytical work) and teach economics and statistics part time at a State University here in California and community college too so I have at least average intelligence and know my way around computers and all). Like I said above I tried MS exchange option under settings and it did not work. I did also researched help forums online for ways people did it. Did not work for me after several attempts. I think I went to the email wizard set up and did it this way after several attempts wasted a few good hours the whole afternoon pretty much troubleshooting how to link Gmail to my N900; finally got it to work but it is slow in refreshing every time you go to your inbox it refreshes and takes a few minutes. By the way my C6 I decided to test email it so I sent one out but it did not go out immediately so I did another send mail and again I have 2 outgoing emails in my inbox for the C6 I noticed too that the inbox would not populate even though on my PC I see a new email (Gmail on my C6 was working earlier!); anyway decided to uninstall the gmail account on the Nokia C6 and reinstall maybe there was a glitch so when I tried to start fresh and install Gmail again on the C6 I can't get pass by the intial set up since when I click Start it would not go anywhere I guess the network is down will try again later. I tried at home and reinstalled gmail on the C6 and now can receive and send emails without the outbox holding the waiting to be sent email it was almost instant...good. Anyway back to the N900 . . .the next day the Google talk (preinstalled on the N900 did not have to use a 3rd party app to access Google Talk like I did on the C6 which I used Nimbuzz) it was not connecting. I will need to troubleshoot why the Google Talk is not connecting on the N900 after I finish this review.In addition to the physical keyboard there is a virtual onscreen one but you have to activate it first under Settings-->Text input and then check mark the box to enable it. Then when you type in the field entry box for say a text message it pops up (the physical keyboard has to be closed for the virtual keyboard to show up)I am beginning to notice a theme with Nokia phones C6 or N900 linking Gmail to it (email calendar) is a pain and/or does not work well (Google this topic on the web using key words such as Linking Gmail to Nokia N900 and you'll see a lot of other people wasted a good day on the same thing--I started at 9am or so and it is now 4pm; skipped lunch too and I just got Gmail set up and the desktop widgets all organized/customized with thoughts of returning the N900 during the frustration). Anyway for the N900 I got it set up and customized the home screens for the home screen you have 4 screens I customized with the following on each screen:Homescreen #1: Various ovi apps (since I need to quick access to download more apps when I have time)Homescreen #2:  Various tools such as calculator calendar phone settings ovi mapHomescreen #3: Various bookmarked webpages such as cnbc yahoo google calendar (this is how I access my Google calendar: via web) Gmail as a backup in case the email client on N900 is not behaving; web globe icon for web/internet accessHomescreen #4: contacts people I call most (it's cool in that if there is a photo linked to the contact you see that photo) also a voicemail button; also have am sms icon email access icon I  need to find out how to add Google talk as an icon here for quick accessTo access each homescreen you just flick across the screen like you're flipping pages and the next screen shows left to right or right to left depending how you flick. By the way on web pages to magnify you move your finger in a circular motion clockwise and the opposite to make smaller again.Also the only way the screen will be in portrait mode (vertical) is on the phone use setting otherwise everything else you use the phone for will be in landscape mode which is disappointing I'd wish the screen would flip to portrait and landscape for everything; if I remember correctly my Nokia C6 flips back and forth from portrait to landscape for everything.Bottom line if you want an easy to use phone that is user friendly and intuitive to learn fairly fast (within 1-2 hours) 100% go with the Nokia C6 (which has voice assisted GPS guidance and the N900 does not) I picked that up in an hour or two and got it all set up. The N900 is a sports car of a phone a Ferrari that has transmission problems that is takes more time to master the set up and screens widgets and stuff. If you don't enjoy tinkering with gadgets (non techie type and just want a phone that works and easy to set up) the N900 is NOT for you. On the other hand if you want to sacrifice some functionality/ease of use for looks get the N900.

2	I nicknamed this phone the brick Nokia can't be serious. With such sexy smartphones on the market (nexusone iphone 3gs droid palm pre) they cant really expect to sell this phone in any real volume its just not gonna happen. This phone is in the same price range as the very sexy and capable nexusone.Here the upside (and why its not that great):- Browser support full flash (so does nexusone).- Panaromic desktop (i just couldn't think up enough things to put on them all).- Keyboard is better than droid.- Highres screen is nice.- Camera is responsive (better than the G1).Here's the downside:- Very thick (i mean uncomfortable in pocket thick).- Most menus only work in landscape mode (even the main menu).- Doesn't support exchange 2003 yet.- Screen is a finger print nightmare.- Very few supported app no ovi store yet (not that thats saying much).Here's a list of my recent phones (last year) which was my base for comparison:- Blackberry Curve 8900 (excellent for a BB)- Blackberry Bold 9700 (not as good as 8900)- Nokia 5800 XpressMusic (loved it it's not pretending to be a smartphone)- Nokia 5800 Navigation (same as above)- Nokia 5530 XpressMusic (same as above)- Nokia N97 (nice phone not worth $$$)- Nokia N900 (brick)- Tmobile/HTC G1 (not bad for a first try)- Tmobile/HTC Touch Pro 2 (brick with weak software/os)- Motorola Droid (nice hardware even better software)Nokia's real problem is that they have not managed to capture the imagination of developers like apple and google have. Its nice maemo is open source but why would a handset manufacturer use it when they can use android. And without widespread manufacturer support I don't see maemo making any real waves in the handset market.If you want to spend some $$$ on a smartphone I would take a look at iPhone 3GS (AT&T;) Palm Pre (SPRINT) Moto Droid (VZ) or HTC NexusOne (TMOB) depending on your carrier of choice.
2	I received the N900 today and have been playing with it for several hours. I find the form factor to be fine and like the heft. If feels solid in your hand. Others have done a good job of discussing the pros and cons of this device: it's got a great web browser it's easy to zoom and enjoy the full web the mail calendar and contact apps work well together and the skype integration with the dialer is great. I haven't got into the media player or maps just yet and I'm not sure it will be around long enough for me to do so.There is one thing in fact that is really really bad. I am running a Zimbra Server at work. With all my other phones I use activesync to update mail contacts and calendars. I've successfully synced with an iPhone Nexus One (everything but calendar) and the Droid. With the N900 however exchange integration is very weird. Contacts and calendars work great but the majority of the mail comes in blank. The header is there but there's no body to the messages and the from field says no recipient. I did a search on the Maemo forums and others have reported the same behavior (some running Exchange server 2003 and 2007) so it doesn't appear to be strictly a Zimbra issue. I tried setting it up using IMAP which at least allowed me to read the whole message but it was just too slow and I really have become accustomed to activesync.This phone was supposed to replace my jailbroken and unlocked iPhone as my primary business phone. I moved it to T-Mobile as I was dropping far too many calls on the more bars in more places just not my places network. As it stands now it won't. Unless I (or someone) can figure out a way to make the activesync work reliably the phone will have to go back.Finally there's been a bunch of discussion on whether Maemo will continue to be supported by Nokia. Just last week they announced an alliance with Intel and are combining the Maemo and Moblin Linux distros. They've named the new project Meego. So it appears that this may be the opening (and swan) song for Maemo. MeeGo now...
2	I wanted a mirror and I got one - however even when your screen is on you can barely see it in the sun.
0	These screen protectors were very chunky and I could not get them to go on my phone correctly. I cleaned my screen before applying them and still no luck.
2	hate this it has some stickers that come on the protector that is a pain to remove without damaging the plastic itself a complete waste of time plus it's a bubble machine no joke.
0	The item was easy to install; however compared to other screen covers it is too soft and therefore leaves behind many noticeable bubbles.
0	i would buy a screen protector for a blackberry ever again not worth dont buy it not much else to say
2	I purchased these protective screens for my mom; who owns a Blackberry Curve. It came w poor instructions on installation. I had to go on YouTube to figure out how to do it and not get the mess of bubbles. After wasting the first one thinkin it was a simple 1 2 step I got it with the second one. Glad 3 came in a pack. After u get it on correctly its very nice fits perfectly.
0	I received them later than supposed so since i was on a trip I couldn't get this product. Bad experience...
2	It actually looks pretty cool once installed properly. Installation is a little more difficult as compared to other models. It also has significant glare and seems to scratch very easily .. or maybe it's just noticed more because of the mirror surface. In any case it's just an OK product. I eventually removed it and I am using a dark tint privacy screen.
0	This Procter does not stick on my device can I have a refund.
0	Def not buying any of these ! Rips in half and it doesn't work at all/ it doesn't stick right and I wasted money for nothing -_-
2	The screen protectors are quite cheap I find myself replacing them about every 2 weeks. I might purchase again but I may just go to Verizon and have them put a quality one on my phone.
0	I had ordered this product before and I was extremely happy with it.  However when I ordered it a second time I did not receive the same product. They were not matte finish but more of a glossy one. I could see myself in the reflection which shouldn't happen with matte. I'm sad! :(
0	this item is not worth the money spent on it. It can not stand up to being used.  don't spend any money on this item
2	I wouldn't get this again it is a nice screen protector but it has very little if any affect as a privacy screen.
0	&#34;Ocean-City is committed to providing each customer with the highest standard of customer service&#34; This has got to be some kind of joke when it takes a month to recieve such a small and simple item. I should have checked more into this companies shipping policies but I based it on the customer reviews which I am begining to think may have been submitted but the company employees. There standard shipping policy is up to a month on all items. Utterly ridiculous. I could have gotten a similar product from 100 other shippers but at less than 2 dollars I was being cheap. You get what you pay for (I paid almost nothing and thats what I got).
2	really hard to see when u want to text or call anyone specially when you are outside the mirror looks and works fine.
2	This protector is fine but it is definitely not anti glare. Also you can usually find a 3 pack somewhere on here for the same price.
2	I like that the mirror screen works when the phone is off but when the phone is on there is a weird rainbow effect that makes me dizzy. I will probably replace it when my new screen protector arrives.
2	When you trust a picture you're always going to be letdown. While they do cover the screen they're not as reflective as they appear in the photo.  If you need an inexpensive screen protector this is not a bad way to go just as long as you really don't want to use it as a mirror.
0	I wouldn't even give this thing a rating it deserves a no rating but that's the only way to write a review. Never get this I should have listened to the many reviews about this junk
2	Work as described.  Can't beat the price and lets face it if ur a stickler for getting them on correctly and without dust particles underneath u need to burn thru a few to get the hang of putting them on so you might as well get a few packs at this price.
0	i really thought i would like this but i got so many bubbles and i ended up crumpling it and tossing in the trash because i got frustrated trying to fix it
2	My screen looks to blurry and it didn't fit the whole screen plus I had to wait along time for this item to arrive but I guess for the price it's ok. Wouldn't recommend buying though.
2	phone shield makes rainbow colors cant see iPhone screen at all no matter which position and brightness .cheap price
0	These screen protectors are horrible!They glare & have this hazy effect to them. Not only that but the screen also looks grainy when using my phone.This was the worst screen protector I've ever bought.They also don't align! It'll fit perfect by my front camera but off when it comes to my home button & when aligned with the home button it's off by the front camera. That annoyed me so much!I'm good at putting on screen protectors & these were just one big disappointment.
2	This keeps the screen from scratching tremendously.  Unfortunately does not protect from cracks at all.  I knew that going in however.
0	Horrible can't see my phone in my apartment let alone outside in the day light WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! Seller shipped decently fast nothing to call home to mom about but the product is horrible the sticky adhesive also stretched during the application process and caused an &#34;abrasion looking&#34; mark in the middle of the screen! Buyer beware even if it fits you cannot see what is on your screen.
2	this screen protector was alright I would of preferred it to have instructions because 2 sides were sticky and I was confused about which side went where and now everything is sticking to the front of my protector but its stuck to my phone? so why are both sides sticky I don't understand
2	They are pretty good at doing their job that is if you can get them on right. They are a big hassle to get on and if they start to peel the whole thing will come with it.
0	This product is not what is advertised. They are glossy and allow fingerprints dominate the screen. Reported this to the seller and received a reply stating that it is the only kind they have.Now on the other hand this product is constructed well and is a perfect fit.
2	Poor quality... Peels up and bubbles around the edges especially if you have any type of case.  Surface is poor too very &#34;orange peel&#34; looking.Unless you just really like chrome and want it as cheap as possible I'd pass.
2	This mirror screen serves its purpose  however when you are outside and its really sunny its hard to see your apps overall the price is good
0	I just got these in the pail. Put one on my phone and immediately was disappointed. It makes the screen have a bluish tint with the rainbow effect when you move it around and I get a headache just looking at the screen. It looks like I have 3d glasses on and am walking around in the sun. Definitely don't recommend and if I could upload a pic to this review I would it's terrible
2	Maybe I'm just not as hooked on the whole &#34;it has to be aluminum if it's going to touch my iDevice&#34; thing as some other people are but while this stand is quite nice it's just a little expensive and not truly any better at holding up my phone than the PodProp I bought a few weeks ago.  The PodProp is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper and comes in a pack of two it's a soft-touch covered foam stand so I don't have to be gentile about putting my phone on the stand and it's got cable management built in just like the M2.Even better the PodProp is made in the USA :-)So I'm keeping the M2 to use as a display stand for an iPhone that's installed in a demo kiosk but for my desk and live demos I'm going to be using the PodProp instead.
2	I bought this to replace a dock that was incompatible with my bumper-style case.  I initially balked at the price tag but figure it would be a well-engineered quality unit.  I was wrong.  It's not terrible but this should have been priced as a $5 knockoff.  My complaints:  1.  My unit was cast poorly with underrun in a couple of places and as mentioned in another review the stand makes a scraping noise on the back of my phone.  While these disappointments weren't worth the hassle of sending this one back and having to find another stand/dock there's just not much value here.
2	One of the greatest accessories I have purchased for my Apple family. It hold my iPhone and iPad! I wish that the item was a bit more weighted down though.
2	to be honest with you guys this docking station is ok but not great because everytime you charge the phone you have to hold the charger then put it on the dock unlike the sinjimoru if I am correct all ypu have to do is just flop it and it's charging. Sorry but I purchased another product and it costs less than the Elago.
2	Returned this. It's simple just a metal stand! You can get a case or cover that has a clip to pull out for a stand This is definitely not worth the price charged.
2	I'm not sure the street rate for aluminum but it must be pretty high because this stand is way overpriced. Needless to say I bought it anyway because it mirrored the look of my iMac.  The stand is a solid piece of metal that has grippy things on the bottom to prevent it from sliding on a desk.The design is great but it's over priced. It should be around $12-15 not $25.
2	I absolutely loved the color and feel of this cover.  It fit my phone like a glove and stayed put unlike other sliders I've tried. However after like 2 weeks the color started to fade.  It faded so bad I had to trash it and order the metallic version. Still waiting for it to arrive hopefully it is of better quality.
2	I was so excited to get this case and it was an AWESOME color.  Within a couple of weeks it started losing color at the top (where the sunshine hits it when it's in the car holder) and it has subsequently lost color where it is held a lot around the sides.  A little more than a month later it's splotchy enough looking that I'm researching a better replacement.  Too bad it fits my phone nicely and is great protection.  The color fading is just very disappointing.
2	This is a great case that still keeps my iphone safe in a sleek and simple fashion. Just beware as other reviews have stated that the glowing brillinat beautiful tone that you have for the first few months will fade to a two-tone more weathered look. Not a big deal but good to know especially since it is so striking in the beginning.
2	Maybe I just got a defective case but it has already cracked through near the sync cable port.  I've contacted support to file a claim on warranty and hope to have a replacement one shortly.
2	This case provides both flexibility and durability where you need it.  However the input covers are a nuisance.  There are better cases out there.
2	Based on all the rave reviews I thought I would really love this case.  I don't.  The material is rubbery as I expected but what I didn't expect was for it to be so loose around the sides.  It will just flip right off if there wasn't the clear plastic support on the back to hold it tight.  That plastic piece looks so cheap and tacky.  My phone will not fit on my iHome for charging with this cover on.  I have to take off the clear plastic piece to be able to manipulate the rubber on the bottom to fit it onto the charger.  I purchased this during the Gold Box special for $15 and I don't even consider it a value for that price.  I plan to move back into my ifrogz case which I also do not love but at least it has a snug fit and will sit on my iHome.  I would not recommend this case to a friend.
2	This is my first otter case.  The concept and design are pretty good.  I have owned 2 Speck Candy shell cases previously and both have served me well.  They offer superior protection due to their hard plastic covering which protects all 4 corners of the phone as well as the back - fully covered except for the camera hole.  The design does not interfere with keyboard access or cause the edge of a screen protector to pop up.So why did I switch?The speck is a one piece design and remarkable except for one thing.  The thin portion of the frame near the bottom of the phone's face eventually cracks and then breaks off over time.  The case remains fully functional and still offers great protection but you have a broken case that eventually becomes a bothersome eyesore.The Commuter case is a compromise for me. It's slightly slimmer than a speck and is comfortable to hold.  It offers good protection but not the same level afforded by a case that has a rigid shell at all four corners.  If the commuter case had this it might be 4 stars.  The commuter is not the case you want to rely on to protect your phone in case of a fall.  On to carpet no problem.  On the cement you might need a new screen.  No one plans to drop their phone but accidents do happen.  If the need arose I don't see myself buying another commuter case.  I'd have to opt for something with a little more protection in the corners.  The Otter defender series or another brand altogether.Update - After 3 months of ownership I will be going in another direction.  The case does offer a medium amount of protection but the rubber flaps that cover the plugs for the headphones and charge/sync port are a pain to deal with.  Fumbling to plug in while driving and/or docking to charge the phone at night.Final update: Lowering my review to 2 stars.  Look elsewhere for good 3GS protection and ease of use.  The case is comfortable to hold and offers a basic level of protection but the speck is better all the way around even after the frame breaks.  I dropped my 3GS many times (on cement) and it never showed a mark thanks to the Speck.  This particular Otter is a fail and the rubber flaps while well intentioned to keep dust and moisture away keep you from docking charging or connecting headphones easily.  After 3 yrs I'm ready for a new phone anyway.
2	This was purchased to replace a broken case and it didn't work.  The case would not stay on as it kept on slipping off.  I had to return it.
2	Today I received the Jabra C250 and the Jabra C500 headsets.  The C500 is better designed for use with cellular phones but the sound quality in the ear piece and microphone is not as tood at the C250.  The person I called compared the two devices and said the C250 was like AT&T wireless voice quality (talking in a tunnel).  The C250 was also a bit more comfortable in my ear.
0	This model the C500 is one of 4 Jabra headsets I have ordered. I continued to try different Jabra models because the ear piece is by far the most comfortable and best sound quality I have ever used however all 4 Jabras had very poor microphone quality. With each one the persons on the other end could not hear me. Disappointed. I found that it worked well with a cell phone but almost no volume on a cordless phone.
0	I wasn't expecting it to last a lifetime but it stopped working after 2 weeks of using it. the connections on the head snapped and i could only hear people when i bent the cable a certain way. this worked for a few days and then the headset stopped working completely.
2	Review Update Oct 11 2010:The headset is still working.  The issue is that the plastic on the outside of the right hinge (top right of the headband) is now slightly cracked so there is little pressure holding the hinge closed on the right side when not worn on the head. I've been very careful not the simply snap the headset closed and was pulling the hinge down (and clear) first then folding shut but it still happened from time to time.  So the material failed within 3 months.  Sad because I'm very fond of these.  I still use them every day I just have to be careful because they will occasionally turn off when I take them off and the right side folds in.Original Five Stars! Review July 16 2010:Probably the best bluetooth headset I've used as far as sound quality and functionality.I was able to successfully pair it with my Mac Book Pro iPod iPad and Blackberry Tour.  Sound quality is great.  The volume control does take a little getting used to but I've adjusted to it.  Just swipe up to increase the volume and swipe down to decrease.  It may take a few swipes to get full volume.  Don't expect it to be exact (ie. top of the control is full and bottom is mute) but if you swipe slowly you can get it adjusted perfectly (start at the bottom-up to increase start at the top-down to decrease don't start in the middle).  There are incremental beeps to help you gage the volume.Volume control works with MBP iPad and Tour.  It does not work with iPod.Next/Previous track works with MBP haven't fully tested it with the iPad does not work with iPod.Button in the middle accepts/cancels calls and pauses tracks.PROS:Taking calls is simple and callers report that they hear me clearly.  Often they don't realize I'm on a bluetooth headset.I love the fact that I can have it paired to 2 devices at once.  I can use it with the MBP or Ipad and still take a call on the Tour.  After the call the halo switches back to the other device.Not as portable as my Jawbone II but it has better call quality (which is surprising with no noise cancelation).  I'll still use the Jawbone in the car and on the go.The Halo can be charged and in use at the same time.  It accepts the standard mini USB (slim profile) connection which means I can keep it topped off on my laptop USB when I'm working and unplug it to move around.Also included is a wired 3.5 mm jack (fits into the USB port) so you can use with non bluetooth devices and a self closing storage pouch.  Nice touch.CONS:To turn off the device you have to fold it up.  It does not fold flat and is kind of bulky I suppose you could just hang it around you neck but it's not discrete by any means and it remains on as long as you have it unfolded.I'm a bit concerned with the snap fold idea for turning the device on and off one would hope that it's been fully stress tested to last repeated the snap-open snap-closed.  It makes a satisfying pop when you fold it just wondering how long till that hinge fails.  I'm using it primarily in the office so it's open on and charging most of the time.The felt ear pads do make my ears warm it's not unbearable.  They appear to be non-user serviceable  I can't find any seam or way to replace them.  As with the hinge concern only time will tell...I researched this headset and understood it's limitations with the devices I was planning on using it with.  Overall very happy with it.
2	I've shopped around and tried out SOOOO many different stereo bluetooth devices. Most notably have been devices by Motorola and Plantronics. The specific model numbers elude me at the moment. The Motorola was nice but cumbersome and the battery died after a few months. It had a band that went behind the head and was inflexible making it very uncomfortable to wear while leaning my head against anything such as the headrest in the car or a pillow in bed. The Plantronics faired better but the noise canceling wasn't very good.I typically use my devices for conversations of both a business as well as a personal nature. For talking with my friends it would suffice but not for clients. I also use my device when I'm working out at the Gym. It doesn't do very well when I work up a sweat but the Halo device fares better than others.I had a great deal of difficulty pairing this device the first time and it took me 3 days worth of emails with the technical support department of Jabra. They wouldn't provide me with a phone number and usually returned my emails within a few hours. I still can't figure out how to move forward or backwards through my music. I did it once by accident and haven't been able to figure it out since.Overall the noise canceling is good and the quality of the sound it produces is very good as well. The only reason I'm not ranking this more than 3 stars is because of how difficult it was to figure out and the fact that I STILL can't get certain functions to work. Overall I like this better than other products of this kind.
2	i bought these headphones because i like to go to sleep listening to music...  i wanted the headphone to be thin enough so i can sleep on them and i want it to be bluetooth...it meets these 2 requirements but...it has a major flaw...  when the volume is set at the lowest setting it is very loud...i mean teenager loud...  it's so loud that i doubt anyone could fall asleep with the sound level...  it's loud enough that you could hear the music great on low while on the commuter train or in the public...on the plus...the fit is perfect for me...and...the sound is superb...even while blasting...  i don't know how long the battery will last since i can't listen to it for very long because of the volume problem...i called jabra...they are working on a software fix...but...have no release date...so...buy at your own risk...
0	I usually don't leave reviews unless I can remain positive for the most part but I really feel like I need to voice my opinion about this product. I am one of those people who think they can read all the negative reviews and then think it will be better for me because I am really good with this stuff. I was dead wrong.I have wanted a pair of these for a very long time now but after only a week with these things I have had nothing but problems-Half the 'felt' from the headband is already falling off. It's all over my head every night and very annoying and makes the product look terribly cheap.-The cheesy fold to power off/ power on is a complete joke and the hinges feel extremely fragile to me and likely to last less than a few months at most. This means there is no way to wear them around your neck if out and about with no other way to hold them and wish to have them turned off. And it also means you have to fold them in order to charge with out interfering with your backup bluetooth headset. I found this to be a very annoying problem becuase I wanted to avoid hinging them as much as possible because of the cheap hinge feel.-The charging indicator works nothing like advised in the manual. You plug it in and the battery blinks red for 2 hours and then just turns off. It never turns to green like it is supposed to and unless it does it wont turn on. The first charge took over 4 hours 2 hours blinking red and then turned green after another 2 hours of no indication light at all. The second charge I had it plugged in for 5 hours it blinked red for the first 2 hours and then did nothing for the next 3 hours and when I went to use them the battery was still dead!-Terrible uncomfortable fit that will have your ears throbbing within the hour and a design that in no way attempts to stay flat against your ears or stay even remotely positioned on your head in an active environment.-Constant clicking and static sounds heard during silent periods between songs/during pause time.-It is not possible to initiate voice commands with the headset. Long pressing the center button only puts it in pairing mode to pair with multiple devices at the same time. Seriously a bluetooth hands free headset that cannot initiate voice commands so I can make a call?-Jabras customer support declined to respond to my emails or call me despite their *STOP DO NOT RETURN TO STORE* labeling. I gave them a fair chance to support their product and they declined.+On the bright side when they did work the phone calls were crystal clear and music sounded amazing with deep rich lows and crisp vibrant highs with plenty of volume even when working in noisy environments with power tools. No call complaints what so ever.+Volume controls worked very well precise and consistent for me. EVEN with my work gloves on.Promptly returned. BUYER BEWARE.The JayBird Sportsband is a far superior product in almost every way.JayBird Sportsband Bluetooth Headphones (Midnight Black)
2	I've been looking for a set of low-profile BT headphones for a while and thought the Halo looked pretty good.  The sound quality was great but these headphones don't feel like they're going to last very long - I've only had them for a day and already the crappy plastic hinges have gotten very loose.  I can see where they are already starting to wear.  They are also really uncomfortable on the ears.  It's a shame that such a cool design was done so poorly.
0	I started this journey by ordering one from Amazon.  It was dead on arrival. Would not charge.  I returned it and got a replacement.  Same thing.  Red light flashes for a few seconds to minutes then goes out. No green light EVER. Returned it. Got yet another. Same exact problem. To make a long story short I just got the 5th one today. Brought it home plugged it in and red light starts flashing. After about 5 minutes light goes out. Dead. Nada.  At this point it is just laughable.  I know it is not my issue since it is the same socket I use to charge my Jabra BT530 and it works fine.  Know what....the thing is going in the recycle bin and I hope I never ever see one of these things again.
2	I bought both the BlackBerry VM-605 and the Jabra Cruiser at the same time to compare. After testing them I liked the Blackberry VM-605 better because:1) The Blackberry VM-605 fits the sun visor much better. The unit is nicely contoured and has a larger spring clip.2) The Blackberry VM-605 looks like a garage door opener and it is less likely to get stolen from your car than the MP3-player-looking Jabra Cruiser.3) The Blackberry VM-605 is simpler to use because the main button turns the unit on and off. Best of luck trying to slide the power switch of the Jabra Cruiser while driving!Features I am missing on the Jabra Cruiser:1) Modest elegance.  The chromed ring is not needed in my opinion.2) No instructions marked on the unit itself. Sure the manual is clear but you need to learn all the various functions of the main button. The BlackBerry VM-605 also has no instructions marked on the device.Both units have clear and loud sound in and out. Both units are surprisingly small.
0	I read all the reviews before buying and just thought the complaints were from people who were not tech-savvy. Wrong. I consider myself to be a tech and computer expert. Still you need a manual to tell you how to make a call and perform other basic tasks.  That is absent here. The quick start document that comes with the product is worthless has English and Spanish versions mixed together and only shows you a picture of the buttons and tells you how to pair the device. No help for the true functions of the device.My device had hardware  failure out of the box. FM transmitter did not work.  Power on / off button worked only intermittently.  I had to find out the following the hard way.(1) the Jabra web page support site has NO way to submit a tech support request NO phone contact number. The only thing you can get there is a brochure advertising their headsets. (2).  there is NO USA phone support line - you can call for help only in Australia China Singapore Japan.With no instructions it was a bit tough for me to figure out that I had a true hardware failure.  But finally it became clear to me the FM transmitter was just broken. The on / off switch was not reliable. Many times you could not turn the speaker on.this unit is getting returned. now that I am aware of the complete lack of support from Jabra would never recommend buying from them again.  I've had earpieces from them in the past which were adequate - but now I know that when you need help you have no way of getting it.  Please avoid Jabra and get another product.I owned this for 5 hours before returning it.Ratings:looks: 9/10. stylish black plastic. But the smooth finish is awful for fingerprints.function: 5/10: does pair easily with any bluetooth phone. will play songs from the phone. will answer the phone and hang up the phone for you.  Will shut itself off after 10 minutes if no activity. has separate on/off switch making it easy to shut off  when you leave the car. Unfortunately for me: on/off switch broken. FM tranmitter did not work.  If all things worked as promised this would be a fantastic device but not so.reliability: 0/10: during my 5 hour ownership. would periodically lose its connection with my phone then re-connect. The FM transmitter turned on once for only 5 seconds then shut itself off.  other than that the FM transmitter never worked at all. The on / off switch failed. You could turn the unit on only intermittently.Construction: 5/10: The thin plastic construction does not give you any confidence for durability. I'm afraid if I dropped it from a foot or more it would shatter. Construction very cheap. Can't believe this would last more than two months for normal use.Instructions / manual / support : 0 / 10 .  Wish I could give a negative number here.  If you don't believe me visit jabra dot com and click on support --- see for yourself that you have no way of asking a question nor of getting help.
2	I would not purchase this again. Its junk and is a pain to use. Mine is in a kitchen drawer and will be sold at the next yard sale.
2	I had great expectations for this but I am more than disappointed.Like many others have reported here the unit is FOREVER dropping the connection and the re-connecting. Just a plain pain!As others have also said the instructions are USELESS..at best.And most irritating to me of all is that I've not been able to figure out if this thing allows you to initiate OUTGOING calls. If it does can someone please tell me how? I've had two other car Bluetooth speaker phones and it has been simple to make a call by pushing one button. Maybe I've missed something in the instructions but there is nothing even remotly user friendly about this thing.Based on my experience to date I can not recommend this unit and I would likely never purchase another Jabra production in the future.
2	I had the Jabra SP700 which worked fine.  I gave that one to my husband and bought the Cruiser.  Well sorry the Cruiser didn't work fine for me.  I got complaints from callers that I was echoey and sometimes static sounding or I keep breaking up.  And this was happening without me even using the FM stereo option. I tried everything I could think of repairing etc but I kept getting the same response from callers about coming in all choppy.  I returned it. I'll have to steal back my Jabra SP700 from my husband. LOL.
2	Update April 13 2010:I changed my assessment from 1 to 3 stars after using the case for a while.  All in all not a bad case but rather overpriced.  If you can find an inexpensive plastic case and a silicone case that fits over the plastic case you will get the same type of protection for less than half the price.  I know this because I did this for my wife's phone.I was hoping for a perfect marriage between a silicone case and a hardshell case.  This case works well but is not perfect.Pros:Fits into a leather holster.  I buy inexpensive leather cases designed for the Treo 650 off of ebay.  They work very well for an iPhone clad in a case.It still fits well into a pocket.Cons:Price.  When compared to cheap silicone skins or hardshell cases this case is way overpriced.  It basically is just a simple case with a separate screen protector.  The screen protector is the same one that you can buy for less than $1 each on ebay.It is difficult to plug in a chargerIt doesn't fit into a ipod dock.  All of my skins or hardshell cases would fit.If you want a more robust case I would recommend the OtterBox defender.  I have seen several of these.  This case will work well I just don't think that the high price is justified.
2	Not bad but too bulky for my use.  Doesn't fit as well in a pocket and the rubberized case makes it harder to fish out when needed. Also the iPhone won't dock in the case. The screen protector is excellent. I went back to my Seidio holder with clip.
2	I really cant say that I liked his case a lot.the plastic on the back is slippery and the case is bulky.
2	This pouch is described as fitting a BUNCH of different phones and true enough...all of those phones will fit in it. This thing is HUGE and my iPhone 5 fit into it WITH the foam block that the manufacturer puts into it for shipping...HUGE!
2	The case is good made of authentic leather but not Reiko brand as advertised. Thus I took off 2 stars.
2	Recipient did not find the case any easier to use than a pocket is.  I also have the same case and I use mine more often.
0	My Apples iPhone 3GS does not fit inside this carrier and unfortunately I bought 4 to save shipping.  It may work if you use a pliers for your iPhone.  Now it will coat more to return than credit for the purchase.  This will fit my wife's slide phone but she has no need for a belt clip carrier.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!WOULD NOT PURCHASE AGAIN!!!WILL TRY TO FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN USE THEM.
2	Initially this case was a winner but after some time using it the metal clip has become exposed and is unsightly but still functions If that would bother you look for another case although I still use this I have other cases  that work better but occasionally use this for the way it deploys the phone they got the magnetic flap right but the belt clip is the weak part.
2	This is OK but it is cheaply made so it broke in a matter of two months or so.  I chose an Aduro case it protects my phone even though I carry it in the back pocket of my pants pocket I then sit on it and have dropped it on cement floors without the phone  cracking or breaking.  i LOVE THE ADURO CASE instead.
2	Bought this for use to hold my Droid incredible.  It was to small and too tight for the phone. Also I didn't care for the belt clip.  The case kept falling off.
2	Problem with it there was no adjustment so when I bought a new crystal cover for my iPhone it wouldn't fit so I made adjustments of my own. It has expired now anfter a good length of service.
2	This case seems well made and is the correct size for my iPod Touch 4th generation BUT it has such a strong chemical smell that I am disappointed overall.
0	the little round thing that is supposed to keep the keys attached to the lanyard simply is so loose that the slightest movement will jar keys loose...avoid
0	I was semi-impressed at first but that quickly faded.Pros:  The stylus is a great size.  I love the color choices.  I love that its thin and has a pen clip.  The price is great.  Shipping was quick.However the major downfall and the sole reason I have already purchased something else is the soft spongey tip at the bottom.  It is crap!  Within 10 days of using it the tip squished down is no longer securely attached to the pen and the end of the metal part of the stylus is freely exposed to scratch the iPad.  I quit using it immediately.  I would return it but I have already gotten rid of the packaging and for $10 it isn't worth the hassle.I ended up switching to the BoxWave Capacitive stylus.  Although it's more expensive it is well worth it and works great!.
2	I'm not sure why this is so much more than other stylus'.  I thought maybe it would be better for writing but I was wrong.  It's just OK.
0	This E72 has features which require the d/l of apps. The d/l would not complete properly rendering some of the phone features useless. Apparently my version of Win 7 and OVI/Nokia don't get along. I had to return the phone.Just a note about returns. I had ordered a couple of accessories with the phone. I did not have to pay shipping to return the phone. However I was charged $5.23 and $5.02 for returning the accessories which of course were useless w/o the phone. I was instructed not to ship back both accessory items in the same package which would have saved me a few bucks. I am not complaining about the shipping charges but in the future I will make sure a product works as advertised before purchasing an accessory. Perhaps you may find this bit of info helpful.
0	Aside from the new exterior design of the E72 the problem I've been having is with the Mail for Exchange feature. I purposely bought this for work but there seems to be a widespread firmware issue. Just go to Nokia Europe -> Discussions and do a search for: E72 MfE & Exchange 2003.
0	I've owned several Nokias- four generations in fact and the E72 is the first one I've been dissatisfied with- enough so that I'm considering just returning it and getting another E63 to replace the one I gave to my daughter. This phone seems nicer- the flashlight is still there it's easier to turn bluetooth on and off ovi maps is included it's shiney hefty faster has a front facing camera but....Hardware:There is an extra row of buttons from previous bar phones and that both impinges upon the QWERTY and makes it more difficult to use the extra row of buttons. The buttons add no new functionality- they've just made it more confusing and difficult to use function you want. In particular separating the accept/reject and call/hangup/power buttons from two into five buttons is well silly and frustrating. If you haven't used a Nokia before you may just find it annoying if you've used a Nokia before you'll find yourself hitting the wrong thing and having to poke around with your thumb only to end up hitting the wrong thing over and over. Volume buttons on the side of the phone are nice though. Optical pad is a wash- really what's the point the mechanical one worked great this one not so much esp if you have liquid on your fingertips. It doesn't work as well as the old mechanical button (often doesn't catch your finger) and it's optional vibrations is just annoying bling. The earphone plug now jaunts out a cocky new angle- great except you know what happens to cocky individuals- they get broken off. I'd don't get it.Software:Here's the REAL downside- Nokia have taken the reliable but not flashy Symbian in the E63i/E63 etc and turned it into a confusing non-functional morass. The only upside I found was the hold the home and active applications pop up feature. Otherwise- bluetooth seems nonfunctional with all handsfree radio features I've tried with with- didn't work with my TomTom my car radio or my wifes. Sometimes it connects sometimes not when it does connect sound is crackly and callers claim my voice is garbled. My daughter's E63 and my wife's G1 function perfectly with all these units so it's the E72 not the units. The messaging seems to longer support Conversations (the threaded SMS software) so it's back to 2003 and non-sortable no threading SMS which is a real pain for active texters- you'll spend a lot of time deleting messages scrolling up and down to find things and so on. Both fring and Skype periodically just stop working- you have to remove and reinstall to get call out functionality back. On the E63 both just worked flawlessly. The ordering of the installed applications and menus for configuration have been reorganized and not for the better- it's very difficult to configure a SIP account and by the way- out of the box the phone doesn't support SIP. Very lame.... You literally will spend hours and hours on forums begging the very patient and understanding Nokia employees who volunteer their time there to help you get even the most basic stuff working. Specifically....Nothing is where you think it isNokia has rearranged the menu structure to bring all things you don't use and don't care about up to the top and bury all the useful functionality deeply into a non-obvious and seemingly random location. Once you get there what you're trying to do (see SIP and synching for instance) won't work unless you get something else from somewhere or set it up in a non-intuitive way not covered in the manual but only in the tenth description someone else on the net has spent hours of their life trying to figure out.Syncing with Google Calendar doesn't workFor instance if you've used the very functional and easy MFe before to sync with Google calendar and contacts before- forget it. The E72 turns this single step process into 23 steps to sort of sometimes get it working with no feedback. MFE is now somehow integrated into the phone only in such a way that it doesn't work and won't provide any feedback. You literally have to set it up using fake info cause it to fail and then reset it up to make it work. How Nokia think a phone that requires this sort of nonsense to work is viable is beyond me.SIP doesn't workAgain you have to search pages of forums to find out the top of the line phone doesn't support SIP as delivered. It pretends it does there's a SIP setting but it does absolutely nothing. You can't connect to SIP from from the WAN scan like you used to either. What? Instead you have to register in yet another forum (which you can't do from the phone) to download an unofficial piece of software to enable an advanced setting only to discover that's yet another can of worms to get going. I still don't have SIP working...Multitasking is just confusingInstead of having a straighforward- what you see is what you are doing Nokia has turned Symbian into some sort of web page where things are filling up your memory but you don't know they are running and getting to them takes page after page of back or exit or something. You will wear your fingers out with this crap. Inconveniently the menu options never use will be the top default and what you do all the time (exit) requires three or four finger presses.Despite the fast processor actual use is MUCH slowerEvery press is accompanied by a flashing fade which just wastes your time without providing useful feedback- it just makes everything slower. By slower I mean a LOT slower. Your WAN settings aren't remembered you have to reconnect EVERY timeOVI is just more of the sameI don't get OVI- it's a dumb name if it's meant to include all the Symbian software it doesn't seem to come close.Not one piece of the software needed to get the basic stuff (internet radio SIP sync) was there and seemingly everytime I foolishly try to see if something is there it needs to update itself before it works. They should either ditch this stupid service ASAP and put things back on web pages which DON'T require a different registration (Nokia forums my nokia nokia beta labs Ovi) or put everything in Ovi. Seriously. For instance try and download Nokia maps from Ovi for the E72- it doesn't work. Isn't this one of the only reasons someone would buy this phone?Threaded conversations are no moreIt used to be that Nokia Converations allowed you to thread your conversations by topic sender etc. Conversations still can be downloaded but it no longer works- your one and only option now is just a straight list. Great maybe for a teenager who just texts for fun but try and find a conversation when you're chatting with someone- it's no fun to have to look through 100 SMS to find the one you want when with conversations you could have found it in three thumb clicks. I've ended up abandoning SMS on the phone and just use google voice SMS because it's an order of magnitude better.Nokia has REALLY screwed the pooch on this one. The E72 is a terrible downgrade in functionality from any Nokia phone I've owned before. I was always excited and pleased by the new functionality of Nokia phones- no more. Nokia's were always functional reliable straightforward MADE IN EUROPE NOT CHINA and had all the features other phone/operating systems crowed about. No more..... If this is the direction Nokia is ended I'll leave them behind.
2	570$ vs 230$ as of today (July 2010)~300$ differenceGo with E71 - won't loose much but will keep 300$ in your pocket
2	Didn't fit on the DS.  Perhaps I had the wrong make or something but it was a complete waste of money.
0	Completely wrong product even though the invoice stated DSi. I got a case for the 3D. It's nowhere close to the picture. For what it's worth the product came in the dented box. Oh there was bubble wrap around the screen protectors though. It's not aluminum... It's plastic and seemed really cheap. The hinges popped off when I opened it. Also there were scratches that indicated that there was no care in packaging.From other reviews this could be a good product depending on your luck with packaging.
2	not as good as expected alright for a pouch but after a few month of use it starts to rip. could be better designed but not bad overall
2	If you are not one of the people who go everywhere wearing your bluetooth headset then you will sooner or later have to either leave it at home or put it in a pocket or a similar place where it'll be susceptible to damage.For the price this little magnetically-closed case will suit some uses.I do see a couple of design aspects that make it a bit less than ideal for me: the clip will work on fairly narrow belts. Up to 1 will be OK and beyond that the clip will be permanently open at the bottom of the clip and that flare at the base of the clip will be digging into you and the case is more likely to brush off the belt and perhaps be lost caught in a closing car door or run over.The second thing I see coming down the road in a few months is the construction of the leather which covers the metal clip underneath: the inner and outer leather is held together with stitching and eventually the threads will wear through and the covers will come apart. This is unfortunately a standard manufacturing technique on belt-type cases like this. So -1 star for both these things.Why in the world the designers left one end of the case open may become clear as I use it; but the initial impression is uh why? The left side is open to the outside from about 1/2 way up; a simple U shape cutout in the front would be all you'd need to be able to hook the Voyager and bring it out.The case itself appears to be sturdy enough for normal use is pleasantly padded and will blend easily into business attire. it is not hard-use tactical duty gear. For that I'm thinking perhaps a handcuff case?BTW the Amazon seller did a great job of fast shipping for a reasonable price.UPDATE 9/26/2010Well I wish I could say it's been working out but after 8 days of use it is apparent that an unforseen problem has cropped up.If you are active or have a bulky shirt or sweater pushing on the case the magnet closure will be forced out of alignment and you may find the flap hanging open and pushed askew.To put it another way for belt use the ideal owner will be someone in an office setting wearing a dress shirt and is a person of slim build wearing a narrow dress belt.I added some strips of velcro to mine so now it stays shut when bumped or moved by clothing. This causes the profile to be a little deeper than before but at least it stays shut now.-Minus another star for this.
0	10/22/12 I read the 5 stars and 1 stars. i would give this a 3 but you may have missed like me that it didn't come with a belt hook.I read reviews and didn't look at additional pictures provided.  For some reason many reviews indicate people got the same thing with a belt hook.  it clearly shows (no statement however) belt hook is NOT provided with this one.  That loses a lot of appeal to me.  Fortnately my wife is talented and i think we can makeshift a belt hook and by the sounds of it better than OEM.Other than that it fits but you have to twist it differently than you wear it so with it in your pocket don't expect to quickly answer a call using your Voyager Pro HD.I carry wallet/keys in left front pocket and phone in other but with this it looks like i am going to have to move the wallet to back pocket until i add the belt hook since it does take up more room than expected.  Not complaining because my BT will last longer by protecting it with this case.  Good luck with your decision.  BTW Plantronics Voyager HD best BT I have owned.  I actually use it.  Big enough not to lose it.
2	No very handy to have around loses form easily
2	This carry case is very specific and most likely worth getting. Otherwise you would need to have your Bluetooth in you ear all the time or away on a shelf in order not to break it. In your pocket it'll be broke in less than a week. With the case its much more safe. I think that a metal strip would keep the case from bending and make it rigid enough to last longer. I have had my case for almost 2 months and its pretty beat up under daily use. I wear it less oftn than I would like to because its soft and can't stand a lot of wear anymore.In the end you're better off having it and may need to replace it every few months the voyager pro will thank you lol.
2	This is the secondPlantronics Carry Case for Voyager Pro/Pro+ Bluetooth Headsetthat I have bought.  It's not because I love them; it's because there are a couple of design flaws of which buyers need to be aware.  First I'll touch on the good and bad then the details.Pros:* Nice professional design attractive and non-obtrusive* Reasonable protection for Plantronics Voyager Pro-series headsets* Compact and unobtrusiveCons:* Belt clip leaves it all too easy slip off* Magnet closure opens too easily headset can fall outDetails:As noted above this is the second of these cases that I've purchased and this one only because it came as a freebie on a promotion when I purchased my replacementPlantronics Voyager PRO+ Bluetooth Headset.  My earlier one was lost when I was out cycling and I had the case with the headset clipped to my belt.  I can say that in part this was my own fault as I had wondered how well the belt clip on the rear would hold but since I've had such good luck with Plantronics products over the years I figured that they were better engineers than me.So much for blind faith... and somewhere on a +20 mile bike ride in the late afternoon the case slipped off of my belt so I was out one Voyager PRO+ headset and a poorly-engineered case.If you read the other reviews here you will see that my experiences are not unique as others have had similar experiences. All things being said my initial being upset over the loss of the case and headset has subsided over the months that have passed but I still look at this case very cautiously and now relegate it to the inside of my computer case or camera bag when the headset is not in use.Any recommendations that I might offer on this would be conditional and only if the user put it in another bag or case... and be careful as the magnetic latch opens far too easily. The Voyager PRO+ headset is a good solid product; it's a shame that its case is not.2/17/2012
2	This case is just okay.  It does give some protection to the headset (I bought it mostly to protect the earpiece which it does) but it would have been much better if it was a hard plastic shell case that was molded to fit perfectly around the headset - Which I think should come standard with a high-end earpiece but I digress...
2	The flap cover loses its shape and integrity because of the missing open area. The belt clasp should rotate the opposite direction because the item is almost too tall to put on your belt if you are sitting in a car it can be uncomfortable.
2	You could proabably buy any square/rectangular/boxy case in place of this case.There's nothing special about it that would make it unique and ideal.Here's some of the things that I noticed:* When you open the flap you will notice that the opening is cut out so that it is almost like a backwards L where the long vertical part is there to protect the mike.* The earpiece goes in pretty snug so there isn't really room for the earpiece to be tossed around in.* The leather exterior is nice and soft and the inside makes me thing cheap felt.  It looks worn down and i can see through it even though i have only used it for about a week.* I didn't like the belt clip because it was just too hard to slide anything in.  I haven't bothered with it since the initial try.* I cannot charge the earpiece while it is inside the case... I wish it wasn't like that.* However It does what I intended it to do which is to protect my earpiece while not in use... in my purse.
2	The case is great but I find it not very useful for myself as  have the model that comes with the USB adapter. Plus my headset came with one that has a pocket for the USB adapter. So I don't use it at all.
0	I didnt like the way it fit in my ear. Most of the time it wouldnt stay plus it stopped working days afterwards so I bought another one. I threw it in the trash bad product.
2	This item works good most times but sometimes it loses connection or gets really quiet.  I like corded sets more than bluetooth because I take it off when I'm done talking.  People who walk around with bluetooth headsets all the time look like such Tools!
0	Okay okay - so they were less than $6 each. But one worked poorly and the other worked not at all.The vendor by the way handled it all very quickly and courteously
2	Well the really positive thing is I didn't waste too much money.I wanted to like this thing I really did. It came quickly and looks spiffy. OK then! Plugged it into my Samsung Convoy cell and dialed my business machine.Left a message using the Jabra C510 and then listed to the results -as my hopes sank. Mff mff-mff-mfff mff mff mff- mff! No high-end poor definition midrangey and lots of room ambiance.Sounds almost as bad as my friend's headset that she uses to call me from New York. Almost. Hers is somehow worse but not by much.The folks reporting sounds great are probably referring to the received sound quality which I would say is if not exactly right then close. The transmitted quality was just plain unacceptable.Fit was OK placing over the ear was good cord's the right length for belt-worn cell phone. The little call end button had a nice positive feel. The 'mute' is actually a small sliding switch that has a positive click when it is slid into place.Too bad it just sounds so awful. I'm guessing it's just a cheap mic or I got a lemon.I tried another voice mail to my machine using the phone by itself; sounded fine.FYI if you are thinking of buying a Plaintronics Discovery 975 Bluetooth the little inserts that come with this will work on that device and are a big improvement over the stock Plaintronics ear insert. So it's not money for nothing. Maybe.
2	I purchased this from OEM Planet through Amazon.  For the price it's hard to argue with this headset.  However it was not new in new packaging.  It was in a small plastic bag.  There was supposed to be a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter included but there was not one provided.  I needed this to use with my Blackberry.It seems to function OK and is comfortable on the ear.
2	gets the job done in the office for hands free phone work when you need privacy and the Speaker phone isn't an option.
0	After using this phone for an hour I realized that no one at Nokia had bothered to compare their interface to iOS or Android. Or if they did they didn't realize how inferior their software was.This phones hardware is fine but the interface makes it almost impossible to use. The fact that a phone like this could be released shows how far off target Nokia was in 2009.I'm sure a lot of people like my loved Nokia until they bought any of their first smartphones. After struggling with this I switched to Android and have been quite happy.
2	I really tryed to use the GPS.After Two Weeks Downloading Maps VoicesAnd Reading Foruns I Gave it Up.As a Phone it`s  Great Very Good Music Player But That`s all.For what it offers The Price is little bit high.Too many touchs to get where you want.Disappointed.
2	This was a good camera when I bought for a gift. Only its GPS was so bad. One time it stuck on one place and then never got resolved. But phone works great not the smartphone features.
0	save your money and just use a knife.  this plastic crap does not even work it just shreds at top when applying pressure. 1 of 5 but really is a 0 of 5. stay away.
2	Mine broke. I think the smaller ones are better in my opinion. This was a little slippery and hard to handle.
0	After one use the tip became disfigured from the amount of pressure required to open an ipod. It is also very small.
2	I have used this model before and like many of you I went with it because of its name. It is a good headset however you are paying for the name. Mine broke easily. After spending a lot of money on headsets throught the year I went withBH 280 Bluetooth Headset - 8hr Talk Timeand it is great. It came with a warranty its very small and its costs less than $10. So if it breaks or you lose it which with headsets it always happens you wont be upset. To me its just dumb to waste money on headsets when you have a good one for cheaper.
2	I lost my old blue tooth an HX550 which I loved.  I saw this one on sale so I bought it.  The battery life is shorter and the earpiece is not comfortable.  I should have spent the extra $10 and got the other one.  Calls do sound fine on it at least.
2	I've been using this headset for about 2-3 months now.  Overall I'm very dissatisfied.  The volume on the headset is pretty low even at max and the various ear attachments whether the in ear or loop just do not fit correctly.  I've tried all of them and the inner ear ones fall out with even a little vibration whether just sitting in the car or after a few steps of walking and the over the ear loops hold the headset way to high.  Bottom line is between the low speaker volume and the inability to keep the thing in the right spot over your ear you can barely hear anything.Second major issue for any of you that live in the South where it gets a little hot in the summer is this thing dies in heat.  You can fully charge the battery but leave it in a hot car even for a few hours and it will discharge the battery.  It became very annoying because my main reason for buying the headset was for hands free driving so I naturally leave it in my center console.  It became worthless in the summer for anything but long trips because I'd have to charge it in the car before using it every time.  The quick charging ability of the headset is also greatly exaggerated.  It needs at least an hour of charging to get any sort of decent talk time.The only positive thing I can say about it is the noise canceling works pretty well.  While I can barely hear anything being said to me people I've talked to on it say I sound great even when driving or otherwise in noisy areas.I'll probably buy a different/new headset soon.  This one just isn't cutting it.
2	There are multiple complaints of the ear loop breaking. It is VERYfragile Mine broke. This is so common  the ear loops for the MotorolaH-17 are sold all over the `net inexpensively including Amazon. I boughta 3 pack as I recall. Poor design but at least fixable cheaply.
2	This is a pretty good headset. My only issue is the fact that it takes a few seconds to connect to the phone when the mic door is flipped open. Very light and compact.
0	I received this headset and it was defective. Not a big deal but customer service is horrible! They sent me the wrong replacement unit and argued with me about it. After spending an hour and a half on the phone having to call back twice due to being hung up on They finally decided to send me another piece out. So here it is two weeks later I don't have what I bought and I still have to do all the shipping and follow up calls! I've talked to at least 6 people and they all have different facts about the same product. They just don't know... Maybe if they were from this country...?Continued! On #3 and they are all crap! This one the speaker is all crackly at any volume that is loud enough to hear and the green led(charge indicator) doesn't work! I don't know how Motorola can possibly function with this quality!?!?!I don't usually do bad reviews but this has been the most miserable purchase that I've ever made!!! If you decide to buy one I truly hope that you'll have better luck... I will not buy Motorola again~(hopefully I will always have another choice...)
2	I hve bought this one as a back up to an HX 550 I lost and it was horrible. Like a totally different manufacturer. I say avoid like the plague.
2	I had this product for about 4 months when it decided to break!  I threw it away.  The little black part that flips up and down broke off.  :( :(  The sound quailty was great and everything else was wonderful but the durability sucked.  I don't know why it even broke. When I flipped the little speaker out it just snapped for no reason.  My mouth dropped. lol
2	Wife and I have identical H17's and like 'em a lot. Hers broke so got her another one one of these thinking 'what do I care about packaging?' I did notice that it looked ever so slightly different but figured hey been a while since we bought the other two so just a slight design change no big deal. Well the wife complained that it didn't sound as good as her old one and I even commented that she didn't sound as good on my end either. After a week of her still having the same complaints I decided to give the retail packaging one a try and lo and behold it looked like our old ones and guess what sounded like 'em too!So like the header says get the retail packaged one :)
0	I like the design of the product but was unable to test it because of the poor packaging by the shipper.  In a plastic bag in a big box with other items with no protection and consequently the product ended up broken.  Returned.Update:Having attempted to get one of these three times now the first without retail packaging (ended up broken on delivery) and now the next two has been a game of frustration. First the good the setup worked easily enough as it connects pretty effortlessly with an android phone. Having owned an older model of the motorola headset that lasted a long time I quickly decided once my old one passed into the electronic land in the sky that I wanted to get the newer smaller more compact version that has since replaced my old one years before but the quality of these devices seem to be in decline since the original flip headset motorola released years ago. The H15 lasted barely a year before stopping to work and a replacement broke quickly as well. I decided to give this H17 a chance and as I previously stated the first from an amazon subseller arrived in a plastic bag and smashed to bits and now two more direct from Amazon in the retail packaging and while it arrived in one piece the microphone is a defective mess. I wish I could give this a better review as I love the design of the product and loved my original motorola flip headset the H700 but since then I have been nothing but frustrated with the future evolutions of this product.
2	I really wanted to like this headset but just opening the box was an experience.  I'll bet 15% of the total cost comes from the large aluminum and plexiglass case (the enclosure is 4 x 8 x 4 for a headseat that isn't 1 long come on!).  It took me forever just to figure out how to open that fancy case (turn a plastic clip at the top hidden under the retail hanger).  Okay got this fancy box for this headset...now what do I do with the case?  Put my classic matchbox collection in it and make a shadowbox on the wall?Anyway enough dogging them about the useless over the top case.  This headset was to replace an older Motorola headset and to pair with a new Droid X (another story for another time).  This one is about half the size with buttons also half the size.  That was problem number one.  I had to keep fiddling to find the button.  It is recessed on the headset and is very small so you have to know exactly where to push.  I ended up pressing too hard or pressing on the edge and causing double and triple commands locking up my phone.Pairing it to my phone was very easy.  It walked me through the process and connected immediately.  It also announces when you are connected or not connected to the phone (almost to a point it is annoying).  I found sound quality muffled compared to my old Motorola headset and again volume controls are so small they are hard to find on the headset.I like over the ear headsets and I found this quite comfortable; however if you don't have the device pointed the right direction it will not pick up the voice commands correctly.  I had to look to check it was pointed toward my mouth and not up or down.  Since the mic is so small there is no way to 'feel' that the headset is pointed in the right direction.Overall I am not impressed.  They seem to have spent more time creating this insane case and not focusing on the basics for a headset.  I know small is better but there are limitations when you are blindly reaching for buttons on your ear.  Maybe my headset is out there somewhere...maybe I will find it when I find the perfect smart phone (sorry Droid you didn't make the cut with poor Exchange features and crazy voice dailing)...ah to dream....  :)
2	I loved the size of this bluetooth as well as the flip boom. However the boom broke after heavy usage. I also purchased a different ear gel so I didn't have to use the hook.  worked good until the boom broke.
2	Light weight and comfortable sounds good both ways.The indicator light is too small and dim to be of any use. All the buttons are difficult to find when its on your head. Even the call button is hard to feel and activate. A disappointing purchase.
2	This is by far the most extreme loudest earpeice I have ever put to my ear. It will hurt your ears at high level. The bad side to this thing is that if you turn it off for any reason it may and may not turn back on. You actually have to plug it in to the charger to get it working again even though the battery is not dead. I have ordered 2 of them and sent both back. Now I have the plantronics M50 and it works great but doesnt get as loud as the H17 which is a downside to it but i am still satisfied with my plantronics because i have never had one as comftable in my ear and it doesnt try falling out or even getting loose
2	This is an attractive small Bluetooth headset which is easy to set up and has multiple options for ear piece. The button to receive the calls is also very finicky and requires to be clicked multiple times. But the main issue is that the Bluetooth range of this headset is very poor. You start to hear lot of static once you are more than 10-12 feet away from the cell phone. There are multiple pieces but no case to store all those pieces.
0	This Bluetooth did not work. I charged it. And connected it my phone and it didn't work after that. I had one just like this before and I jus loved it. I thought I had found one again. And now I jus wasted money.I wish people would jus b honest and not sell things that don't work.I really would like one that works. Or get my money back.Thanks.
0	This is nearly a great headset.  It's small the signal and sound are good and the boom-switch is great.  But the fit is extremely finicky and when you find which one of the ear-loops work for you since they don't stay on the headset well you will promptly lose it.And then Motorola Support's voice system will not hear you you can't reach a live person after even 10 minutes on hold and their phones appear to shut down entirely at 5pm.Avoid it.  Other headsets hold onto the ear loop better or at least let you get replacements.
0	I have loved the 700 series of Motorala headsets and the H17 promised to be even better.Actually in the first 30 days of operation of each of the 2 I have bought they have been great.My older one quit working.....well not quit working completely but quit working well enough to understand others or for them to understand me when I was using it with my new HTC cell phone.My new one worked for about 30 days and than started the same degradation of signal as the first purchase.  Still usable but barely.  Yesterday the flip out microphone broke of from the headset body.Basically I can not recommend this to anyone that is not willing to buy a new one every 60 days.
0	This product may have been put on amazon by mistake. It does not fit the blackberry it says it fits.  Maybe the seller got confused. Otherwise the service was fast as usual and amazon made sure received my non fitting item on time. Amazon should look into this seller and make sure they are selling the things they claim to be selling.
2	My biggest complaint is that the corners won't stay down which creates contant gap that allows for dust to get in between.  It's too bad because otherwise it's a great looking screen.
2	I used two of these for my first mounting and still have  bubbles on the edge.  I don't believe that my mounting issues are unique to these screens however.  Functionality is fine but it would be nice if a) dust did not exist in the environment; b) the Storm screen did not move and catch an edge that is slightly off.
0	Worked about 3 days and now it doesn't.  no power at all no light.  Learned my lesson.  sending it back would cost more than just going to Walmart to get a new one.  ohh well buyer beware.
0	I have bought 3 of these and they've all broken upon plugging them in. I thought it was a possible problem with my car so when I bought a new one I tried it in a different car then I bought a third and tried it in my car again. The first one didn't work at all and the second and third ones go in and out so bad my phone is constantly beeping (like every 2 seconds) because it's re-recognizing that it's being plugged in every time the power goes out to it. Very annoying!!
0	I bought this as an add on to get above $25. It only works for me if I physically hold it in the outlet otherwise it shuts off. At least it was cheap.
0	The HTC Evo 4G is stated to require a 1 amp charger. On my HTC Evo 4G the output from this device on multiple rental vehicles that I have used it on is insufficient to charge the phone while using it in GPS mode. It does seem to slightly retard the rate at which the battery would otherwise drain though.
2	I purchased these chargers for my wife's cell phone. The home charger and USB charger work fine however the car charger does not work. The little red light glows indicating it is receiving power fron the car however it does not charge the phone. So in effect 2 out of 3 ain't bad.
0	Updated 1/2010:This phone sucks.  I gave it another chance however as I predicted it's not good in an emergency.  It just locks up for no apparent reason - the soft keys lock up.  The design also is prone to human error.  Plus there's no easy way to turn off bluetooth to use the speaker phone.  You're stuck on the bluetooth earpeice even if you want to use the speak phone or the handset.  So many things wrong with this phone that I'm not going to take the time.My original review:I have a Nokia e71x Blackberry Bold and HTC Tilt 2.  The HTC has the coolest features and reception is exceptional but the Blackberry is *by far* the most usable.Many other users have waxed on about the features of the HTC.  However here are a few deal killers for me:1.  My phone had a tendancy to lock up.  I had to wait for up to 1 - 2 minutes for the phone to respond at times.  If I needed to make an emergency call during these times I would have been in trouble.2.  Sometimes the screen saver won't turn off or the screen won't turn back on when someone calls.  There was no way to turn it back on other than powering down.3.  The keys are extremely touchy.  I've had the phone dial out repeatedly even when I did not touch the screen.  Additionally the UI isn't the greatest (eg while scrolling through screens) so there are a lot of unintentionally dialed numbers etc.If my phone didn't have these problems I'd have liked it much more. I say would have because I got rid of it.  Hence only 3 stars.
2	ORIGINAL REVIEW:having owned this phone for around a month now I find it hard to believe that so many reviewers are writing this phone and the windows phone platform off. Having handled the Droid multiple times now and the iphone many many times I can safely say that this phone stands up pretty well.so let me compare some of the key features:1. styling. to me the tilt2 is the best looking device of the 3. The iphone is close but definitely more professional looking than the Droid.2. phone. speaker phone is easily the best of the three. bluetooth implementation is also the best. not many people consider these features but if you use your phone a lot these are huge in my opinion. the bluetooth connection is excellent.3. browser. the opera 9 browser is probably a shade below safari in usability but it is easier to zoom amd scroll in my opinion than the droid browser. speed is slightly below the droid amd safari but i guess that is because the other three are running faster processors.4. music. audio quality for mp3 is better than iphone at par with droid. the mp3 player feature set is at par with iphone but droid allows you to manage playlists without a pc. but for non protected content all 3 are the very close. with protected content and the genius bar feature gives the iphone a huge edge.5. video. iphone is the best period. it doesnt matter what the screen resolution says the iphone image is more contrasty and pops from the screen. plus itunes is a huge advantage. tilt2 is ahead of the droid if youre willing to synch with windows media player.6. email. tilt2 is best next is iphone only because tilt2 offers better and more reliable synch with exchange server. also new email notification is better with tilt2 v. the iphone. honestly i dont know how good the droid email integration is.7. user interface. the iphone is the fastest and smoothest. the tilt2 is probably the most laggy and requires frequent resets amd is the slowest to load. however the tilt2 ui is at least as intuitive as the droid and both the droid and tilt2 offer multi tasking. but honestly having multiple apps open just eats up battery. with a faster processor touchflo could be excellent. the tilt2 also has by far the best today screen.8. camera. iphone is the best next tilt2 and then droid. resolution isnt as important as processing and here the droid does a terrible job. the tilt2 and iphone cameras are very similar. the droid camera although it is the only one with a flash has the poorest quality image.9. screen. all three look excellent. personally i rate the iphone best because it has very good contrast amd colors. the droid and tilt2 are the same. however the slightly thinner screen of the tilt2 makes it easier to hold in my opinion.10. key board. tilt2 is simply the best. excellent input either via the onscreen (not as good as the iphone on screen) but the best physical keyboard.11. other. tilt feature is great for watching movies or when charging on a desktop in your office. the included memory in the iphone is an excellent feature. i paid almost $100 or so for a 16GB external card for my tilt2. to be replacable memory card replaceable battery is mostly a useless feature. relacing the battery would be cool if it was hot swappable. where there was a small reserve cell that would keep the device alive while i changed batteries.its amazing how effective marking can drive sales. i cant see one real advantage of the droid over the tilt2....UPDATED: 2/1/10While my initial experience with this phone was positive over time I realized that the cons outweighed the pros. Last week I ended up selling the Tilt2 and going back to the Tilt and finally on Saturday I picked up an iphone. Here are the reasons why I decided to take a break from Windows Mobile and switch to the iphone platform:A Little history:I picked up my first smart phone in 2002 - It was a Nokia Communicator. Later in 2002 I got the ipaq 6500 which was an early Windows Mobile phone from T-Mobile I then got an i-Mate JAM followed by another i-mate JAM followed by the T-Mobile Dash and then the ATT Tilt I briefly got a Sony Xperia X1 and finally the ATT Tilt2. So I have been a long time user and advocate of the Windows platform. Here are my problems with the Tilt2 and why I decided to get the iphone.1. Tilt2 is designed to be more of a touch screen phone so unlike the Tilt it does not have a scroll wheel or the 5 way key pad. You are expected to do almost everything via touch. Except the touch UI is not responsive and the icons are really small so that you have to take out the stylus and it's a general mess!2. Windows 6.5 uses a lot of resources and I had to install a software called clean RAM just so that every hour it would shut down and clean my phone so as not to lock up. Crazy but true! The longer I had the phone the worse this became. It would go to 80% memory utilization and then open a couple of apps and the thing is locked!3. Multi tasking I have found after ALL these years of smartphone use is hugely over rated. All it end up doing is that you have a bunch of programs running that you didn't know were running and it slows down the system. So I had to be very disciplined to make sure all the programs were shut down and not just minimized and running in the back ground.4. The claim was that with windows 6.5 the browsing was better than the iphone. Well that is not so. The Tilt2 had 3 browsers - IE Opera and Skyfire (or something like that)....neither comes close to Safari in performance or usability.In the end the slowness of the UI the clunkiness of the toch screen and the general instability of the platform could not make up for a fantastic screen beautiful screena nd build quality and the best key board in the industry. Sorry but the software isn't up to mark!!!!!!The iphone is super fast compared to the tilt2. I noticed the Apple logo scratches really easily and the speaker phone isn't as good as on the Tilt2 - but from a user experience it is a no brainer. Comparing the HTC 3D TouchFLo to iphone UI is like comparing a Dodge Caliber to a BMW 330!UNLESS YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH MULTIPLE DAILY REBOOTS STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE.
2	it works good but the only problem is that once u plug an apple device in it you cant move it aroind much cause it'll start to get static but other than that good product.
0	Bad quality.Dont have transmision power in order to use in any radio.I have tested this product with a lot of devices and is really bad.I dont recomend this.The other coments maybe fake.
2	I tried to get this to work on an iphone 3gs and a samsung captivate sold item at flea market so i didnt have to go through return !
0	I've only been able to get it to work once since it came in the mail and that was after righting with it for a half hour. Ridiculous! Don't waste your time or money.
2	It works well.Its cheap.It is fragile.It will break after some use.The power adapter connection is a VERY weak point.I resoldered it back on once.After it broke again I hard wired the adapter wires to the circuit board. It worked that way quite well.I just ordered my second one the first is just dead. I beat the crap out of it though so I am not that upset.I know what to look for and what to expect this time.
2	When I had it installed the first few days it was fine. It worked just like its supposed to. But I noticed the power connection for the device was loose and sometimes came out on its own. No big deal but after a few times of coming loose and repeatedly putting it in the power port on the device broke off and got pushed into the device. I gave up. I know they won't last a little more than a year but this one just made me bite down and buy a new car stereo.
0	I have been hopeful that I could find an iPod FM transmitter that was worth a hoot and this one showed promise but it worked OK for about 2 minutes then it quit.  I guess my search will go on ...
0	I had rated it quite well. It worked well while it worked but in just a few day of mild use (15min commute to work) it stopped sending sound to the right channel. Bummer an otherwise great device ruined by shoddy workmanship.
0	This product did not work well for me at all.  No matter what station I tuned it to there was always static.  It broke within about two weeks as well.  Just stopped working.  Waste of money.
2	I knew this would be ify at best... the FM transmitters may work great in the sticks.. but around big cities (SF Bay area) it's impossible to find a station that doesn't bleed into the reception on every turn.incredible price fast shipping quality product would order again from this vendor. I hate this review format.. the less words the better No wonder I've avoided this!
2	crap. straight crap. i bought one like this before and it thought it would be as good but that one was much better. must be some different company. don't buy
0	This is a complete POS. I have an iphone 4s and the stupid thing doesn't stay in - well it stays in as long as my car doesn't move. it needs the little clip things that the old ipod chargers used to have (where you had to squeeze the sides to pull it out). Also I have to turn my stereo up super loud to hear it - so when it does fall out I get either the radio station or static blasting my ears out. This thing seriously would cause me to wreck my car. I just received it today drove about 10 miles with it and I am returning it right now. Don't waste your time or money.
0	It has the potential to be great but sadly I couldn't care less about potentials.  Good news is it's so cheap that I may not even bother with the whole returns process because I'd much rather not have to frustrate myself to drive to the local UPS store to mail something for five dollars in returns.  So buyer beware do not buy through amazon prime. Their return policy requires you to actually return it rather than them shipping out a new one or returning the money.  I will recommend that you buy it from a 3rd party vendor that has a tendency to send out a new one or refund it.  I don't even understand as what will Amazon's warehouse even do with a device that doesn't even work.Now as to why it's so bad or atleast the one that I received is that even next to any fm receiving device I'll get 80% static in noise.  Now curiously enough if I place my hand or any body part on the device the signal will clear up and work perfectly fine as if I was some kind of huge antennae.  Once I lose contact however the signal degrades again (I actually have the same issue with a very old fm radio that doesn't have an antennae hooked up and if I touched any part of it the signal would become crystal clear).  Now I actually did get it to work ONCE but then when I put my iPhone down it would just cause static again.  Now at first I assumed it was my phone's cell signal causing an interference (it never hurts to be careful) so I turned it on airplane mode and tried it again no luck. Also even with the whole touching the device &#34;solution&#34; didn't perfectly always work.  Out of the whole broadcasting range I was able to find only a couple stations that actually worked (slight exaggeration).  Also of those my device had to be set to one broadcasting frequency higher than what my car or other fm radios were set to which is quite peculiar as if I set it to the actual frequency it would stop working altogether.The remote that came with the device also did not work.  I assumed the batteries were dead and having some of those circular ones lying around I tried replacing it and it still did not work.  But that probably wasn't even the case in the first place since it did come with a plastic insertion that separated the device from the battery when packaged.
0	I bought this because I am tired of fighting with the wire attached to my Aux in on my head unit when it is attached to my iPhone 4. I really wanted to get aGriffin Technology BlueTrip AUX for iPhone and Smartphonesbut it is a bit pricey. So I opted to try this.To be honest this unit is a disgrace to my Bose system.The sound quality was not that great with a lot of static coming through. This is somewhat masked when you are playing music but if you are attempting to play an audio book or maybe something orchestral you are going to be annoyed. And the bass is majorly lacking when using this unit.The connection did not seem to be consistent. The audio would come through at what seemed to be clear but very frequently static would take over. Especially if you move the phone around.I tried this with many different stations with the same results.This unit will NOT transmit phone call audio to your speakers which isn't a problem for me but I wanted to test it so I could let you know if that's what you were planning to accomplish with this unit.THIS IS A BIGGIE AND WHY I GAVE THIS UNIT A LOW RATING:If you do not transmit any audio through this unit for about 15 seconds it will disengage the connection between itself and the station you are tuned into and screeching loud static will play through without warning until you happen to play something to re-engage the connection.If you don't understand what I mean let me put it this way... You plug the unit into your iPhone tune into the station you have set on the transmitter and the connection is made between the unit and station. Now that the connection is made you hear silence (pending you have a good connection). Now you need to find a song to play. Well you better hurry up and play it within 15 seconds because if you don't the transmitter will go into standby and static will come blaring through your speakers. Quite alarming!Volume control on the iPhone is disabled when the transmitter is connected. Some may think that you don't need volume controls on the iPhone because you can just use the head unit's volume. The problem is the volume being transmitted seems to have been set low from this device. Even with my head unit volume turned all the way up it is does not come close to the loudness of a CD the Radio or the Aux connection in my car.I really wanted to like this because of all the good reviews and the concept was pretty neat. Plus I HATE wires everywhere! But this thing is useless.I am not an audiophile nor am I picky but you really cant enjoy music or audio books with this device.I may have to suck it up and go for the Griffin. Either that or I'll just deal with the wired connection but I will not deal with this.ALSO! Since the price was so good I happened to buy 2 of these transmitters because a buddy of mines CD Player broke in his car with no Aux input. That being said I received 2 completely different units odd enough. And the one wasn't meant for and did not work with an iPhone 4. The second one was packaged much nicer and it said right on the packaging that it did work with the iPhone 4. The button placement was also different on the 2 units.That being said if you do decide to purchase this device this is one of those Amazon orders where 'you never know what your gonna get'. So good luck!Hope this helps!
2	This is just an ok transmitter. The sound was good. They remote is a great addition. Just not great quality in material. The thing fell apart after 2 weeks. Had to glue it back.
2	Worked. Had to kind of finagle my car antenna to get it to connect. But once I did it worked.For the money it could be worth it.
0	Since I only have a tape player in my car I was really excited to get this product to use with my iPhone to listen to my music! When I got it I plugged it into my phone and tried to find a station in my car that I could listen to my music on. I never found a station that I could clearly hear my music on they were all static-y. I was pretty disappointed it didn't work. If you have a tape player in your car like me and want to listen to music from your phone or MP3 player I definitely recommend using a cassette adapter instead of this dinky thing. Even though it was only a few bucks I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money.
0	Did nothing for my service. Waste of money. Ended up just changing phone my phone company. Don't waste ur time or money. Totally worthless!!
0	Unfortunately i should have listen to what other people wrote about this product NOT GOOD it did not improve my signal what so ever.
0	so i bought this for my smart phone (android) thinking it would work even a little bit but its worth less its just a sticker  that makes ur phone sticky and doesnt improve signal strength at all.DONT WASTE ur MONEY!!!!!
0	This did nothing to boost my signal. It was worth a shot for the price. Gave away to others to try :)
2	give it a 3 start because  idk if its actually doing something or not  but since its 2 bucks  doesnt really matter
0	Honestly I can't tell any difference in reception with or without this product. I bought one to put in my Cell Phone and my Wireless Data Internet Card and no difference. I think it's just a gimmick. I would say save your money. I would have rated it no stars but I couldn't.
2	depending on phone depends how it works. Gave me 1 extra bar in house tried in 5 dif phones - most only got 1 bar
2	Kind of hard to tell if they even work it seem like it for a minute but then went back to my regular signal straight.  Sometimes it seems better sometimes it doesn't.  If there is any change it's not enough to waste the money on these.
2	I bought these to see if they worked. Put three of them in the phone and ??? They were cheep so I'm not out much on these. Try them if you think you need a stronger signal if you want to spend a few bucks.
2	Purchased for myself and others of my church. There was no noticeable antenna improvement. I wouldn't advise anyone to look at this as a solution for signal improvement.
0	THE REAL REVIEW:I'll give the seller 5* for promptness 1* for product.  Got this item 3 days after ordering.  Arrived in good shape and as advertised. However as many state it simply does not work.  I ordinarily have between a half bar and 2 bars of signal at my location.  I applied this device precisely according to instructions (behind the battery vertically over the phone antennae... even looked up the antennae location).  No improvement whatsoever.  The instructions said if there was room in the phone I should apply two of these.  Two did no better than one.  Instructions stated it should give me one extra bar of signal.  I notice no increase whatsoever.  So I'd have to file this as the #1 worthless gimmick of the year.  People buy these because they're desperate and it sounds sensible... but I tell ya-- they're simply useless. Might as well stick a piece of aluminum foil behind your battery; you'll have the same effect (namely none).Honestly folks don't waste your money.  Realize the reality of life:  if cell phone companies COULD get another bar of power using a cheap little device like this... that's exactly what they'd be doing.  They don't... so obviously it doesn't.THE SILLY REVIEW... because it's a silly product:At first I was very skeptical about this device.  But when I put it in my cell phone not only did I get 5 bars I got a SIXTH bar I didn't even know was on my phone!  Needless to say I was amazed.I thought:  if ONE does well I wonder what happens when I put in TWO?  So I tried it... and suddenly I was able to pick up ham radio television signals and de-scrambled cable television!I then realized this came in a ten-pack... and realized why!  So I installed all ten of them both under the battery and on the back of the telephone (I would have attached a couple to the screen but that would have blocked some necessary aps).  I was not disappointed.  Now I can receive police shortwave the weather channel and contact the local pizza joint without even dialing their number (that saves in cell phone fees I can tell you).I cannot recommend this device highly enough.  Admittedly when I turn on my cell phone the encompassing glow can be distracting (especially in the dark) and I've started to notice a slight discoloration of the skin next to my left ear where I ordinarily use the phone... but that's a small price to pay to be able to get episodes of DOCTOR WHO directly from the BBS airwaves in England (sadly it's no longer broadcast on my local cable station.  Curse SyFy and their wrestling nights!).  I do admit that sometimes I receive unwanted broadcasts in Swahili and Japanese but I figure eventually I may decide to learn these as second languages.I can't rate this highly enough!  Or lowly enough!  It simply defies ratings!PS-- Be sure to keep this away from children and small dogs as it does seem to disorient them and cause them to fall over at random moments.
2	I bought this to protect the face of my iPhone5. I should have known better from previous experience with screen protectors. The peelable label (1) came off easily. However after struggling with putting the protector on with only mixed success the final label (2) came off only after a struggle and it left adhesive on the protector. This product tends to peel off at the edges and it is almost impossible to apply it without bubbles even using the included applicator. No wonder that it came with 2 extras. It's impossible to put it on well and take off the removable label. This was a waste of money. I can't recommend it at all.A follow-up. I finally rubbed off the adhesive and the iPhone looks better and I can see the entire screen without a mess. The protective material seems to be adequate. There are still a few tiny bubbles under the cover. However they are at the edges and the cover has stuck well to the phone face and I don't think that the bubbles will be a problem. Nevertheless it was still awkward to apply and there are a few limitations. I have changed my rating to 3 stars.
2	The holes are cut to exact for the iPhone 5. It does the job but you can still create bubbles. I think it's slightly off size but it's not real cheaply made. It's ok.
0	Big waste of money. Not only does it not fit the screen it does not line up correctly with the cam earpiece and home button. I am going with SGP.
0	A very tight squeeze for my HTC G2 Vision phone. If I needed to answer the phone I'd have to fight to get it out of the case. Decent case for a much smaller phone. Forget about having a protective cover on the phone it will be clearly bigger than this case. So I bought an over-sized case that fit perfectly.
2	The volume control does not work and the ear buds seem to fall out of my ears after several minutes of use.  Maybe if I wrap the cable around my ears they'll stay in.
2	I picked a pair of these up for under $0.50.  What can you expect for that kinda price.  I have used them for about ten minutes.  I have no complaint about them.  They will be used when I am cutting grass.  The reason for the 3 stars is that one side is about half the length of the other.  It is weird.  But they function so I won't complain too much.  If someone can point to this feature in the description I will raise it to a 5 star product.
2	I received this with only the windshield one which is the top picture and even after being sent another one I still did not receive the prongs that allow you to connect it to the vents in your car which is what I wanted because it shows that in the bottom picture. The suction has a tendency to pop off the window whenever it is moved or the phone is put on it to rough.
0	The sucktion cup ws always falling off never stayed in the position i placed it in  and after aout one month one of the parts just came apart so i just threw it away
2	Nice Looking but quality is kinda blurry. Its well made looks good but the sound quality is comparable to talking to someone with a can & string
2	The earphones took a long time to arrive the material is really good and for the price they are ok but I took out one star because of the quality sounds weird and hollow but for the price what do you expect they are ok
0	I hate this I purchased this for my iPod and to o some exercise but the stupid earpiece keeps falling out. Don't waste your money on it
2	I know these weren't going to be the best quality at it's very low price but I expected to be able to at least hear some sort of music through them but thats not the case. I could barely understand when people were talking to me on the phone or when I was listening to music.
0	I put my volume on as high as it would go and I have a problem hearing music or my conversation with people on my phone.
0	lasted a day
2	It  compatible to the iPhone for but quality isn&#8217;t as good as I&#8217;ve expected.  But the price covers that and makes it worth it
0	I ordered these because I just needed something to use while I was doing homework that I could listen to music and be able to take calls at the same time.  When I received my shipment I was so excited to finally get them because it took quite some time to receive them (about a month) The first thing I noticed was that the cord was not an even length on both sides (uploading pictures) which was quite annoying.  Needless to say you get what you pay for.  I still use them but only one earbud.
2	I had purchased them around Jun or July.Mic didnt work.I wonder in this technology world they cant make one simple earphone with mic working ! Is that too much too ask in a country of super computers & Apple !!? lolMusic is fine but I bought this for talkingWhenever I called other parties always complained about messed up voice & requested me to hook off my phone (they all are tired of my experiements with all such knock-offs !)I didnt bother to return them backyou loose 2 bucks for shipping anywaysAny other suggestion for me? some earphones whose mic works (& which doesnt price as much as 30 bucks !! lol !)
2	The main button/function broke within the first day I got it. It easily fell out and misses the button when tried to put back in. The volume is alright sounds very hollow though. Overall you get what you pay for.
2	these head phones work goodthey were a great product but i ended up losing them and now i dont have any
2	I need to turn connection part to headset jack alot to find the right connection to hear on both ears otherwise only one earpeace will work but I still can use it. I have it for a month now...
2	This headset only lasted 5 days.  The piece where the selector switch is broke apart and the wires were exposed. It lasted another 2 days before i couldn't hear out of one of the buds. But hey it was only $3.
2	It took many moons for this set of buds to get here. I had enough time to buy another pair. Guess these will be a back up.
0	DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONESThey look nice but the sound is muffled.. terrible. The microphone did not work. As I walked with the headphones on they'd change the tracks on my iphone without my hands ever going near them. To top it off they broke after two days.Spend $20 on a usable pair of headphones. I can guarantee it you it's much better than burning $5.
2	It came on time as promised but the sound quality didn't sound as good as my $1.00 earphones. Its ok maybe for smaller children but I would rather use my old ones.
2	I bought these as an extra pair and that's how they get used.The speaker sound quality is reasonable but nothing special and the speaker volume is good (ie. loud).The ear buds fit snuggly but are prone to being pulled out by a light tug.  They do a good job of blocking out some most outside noise but when walking in the wind they really pick up the wind noise blowing past one's ears.I can't really speak to how well the microphone works other than to say the mic and button function the same as the Apple headphones.A couple trival issues.  I really dislike the asymmetrical cord where one wire is much longer than the other after the wye.  I wish the cord was just 6 inches longer as while they do reach from my ears into my pocket I find they often get tugged out of my ears by the cord.
2	Terrible audio quality cheap build but make good headsets. Don't buy these to listen to music or movies with; you'll most likely be disappointed.
2	This is an OK product the reason it gets 2 stars is that the earpiece is too small and falls out with any and every head movement.  It would have been a great product if it had larger replacement earpieces.
2	Fits good in my ears which is why I ordered it but the sound quality was no where near as good as an original iphone earbud headset.
0	These headphones were not good quality. I've order cell phone covers from this company and they're great but the quality of the headphones is very poor. I wouldn't recommend ordering headphones from this company.
2	one of the phone wires is longer than the other one so when you wear both the split is on your left cheek and you look funny
2	I bought this product for two reasons: it had a mic and it was cheap.Although the second reason is certainly a big plus if you want to save money on headphones and aren't a snob about sound quality (sounds just fine to me) the mic was a huge let down.  The recording doesn't work at all and the plastic cylinder feels cheap (that has a button to hang up calls).  In fact I could see some of the red wires being pinched at the cap.Besides poor quality there are a few missing things that could be improved.  The picture showed a clip (presumably to attach the mic higher up on your shirt or lapel) but my product didn't have that.  I was also a little dismayed on the length of the two cords.  One is substantially shorter which is shown in the picture but a detail I did not pick up on.  The product would be better if you could adjust the length of the cords going to the ears (so one does not dangle down to chest level).  There is also no way to control for volume a feature I guess I take for granted and assumed would have been on the plastic cylinder.In the end I would have been able to overlook the cheap quality and lack of features if this product actually had a working microphone.  I already have nice headphones so this buy was rather pointless.  Looks like I might have to spring for the more expensive Apple headphones with mic anyway.
2	When I ordered this I knew they were cheap but was expecting a little better quality.  they work but as soon as you drop them it's over they get disassembled.  .
0	I bought these and wasted all three of them trying to put them on.  I never had a more difficult time putting on a simple screen protector than these.  Do not buy!
2	I didn't like how it messed with my eyes when you look at it. But it got to my house pretty quick
2	It fitted perfectly put it gets dirty so easily firgerprints all over. And when you want to paste it on the Iphone's screen you have a bad time guessing the correct front side. It worked ok for 2 weeks then it fell off. Sadly I bought two gladly they were cheap.
2	This was an o.k. screen protector. It was not a mirror. If you get it to be a mirror you will be disappointed.
0	This item was lost in the mail. So I can not review the case itself however I the sell did refund my money and it was a very painless process.
2	EDIT: June 19 2010:  The headset randomly turns off at times  but the battery life is good so still merits 3 stars.This is a very light headset and fits comfortably and snugly without having to use the ear loop.  Sound quality is fine and it was easy to pair it with my phone.  One added bonus is that it uses the same charger as Nokia phones so I have to keep track of one less thing.  The headset gets only four stars because its range is not as good as my old Philips headset- the max range for this is about twenty feet not even close to the 33 foot Bluetooth spec.  When you start approaching the range limit you will hear static and the headset will unpair once you are out of range without automatically repairing when you get back.
2	feels cheap and flimsy sound is a little crackily but consistent.I bought it on sale at a great deal. if it wasnt on sale I tell you there are better options out there.
2	Not worth even $10 how can this be a Nokia product? Shoddy uncomfortable crappy sound won't stay in the ear.  Go for Jabra or Samsung not Nokia when it comes to Bluetooth tooth earpieces.  I love my $25 Jabra.  I hate this thing.
2	Rim 9700 Charging Pod .. I have problems putting my phone there its not confortable but its small and you can put in any place.
0	Had a Blackberry Torch.  Falls over when charging in this station.Won't stay upright when put in charger. I would't make this purchase.
2	Good idea good price but getting the phone seated in the cradle is just not easy. One would think it would snap in simply but not the case.
2	It's kinda fast to drain esp when u don't use it often and u kinda have to keep adjusting the cord to charge it well
2	THis product DOES work on the iPhone 4S.  The only problem i had was that after about a week or so i went to plug in the 30 pin connector and the charging bay went inside the product rendering it useless.... i guess it wasn't a big loss since it was only $5.  That what i get for buying a cheap knockoff product from hong kong.
2	This little charger is portable and functional. It works when you need it. I'm not sure how sturdy it will be for long term use but great to throw in your pocket when you're out for the day without access to a wall charger.
0	the device dosent come with a charger or instructions altough its simple. I isn't secure to the device. the battery light indicator may or may not work. ackward when attached to your phone.
0	I returned it 1x & the next one charged & stopped working.  It also does NOT charge ur iPad. Glad it was cheap.
2	It worked great for 6 months but it has about half the capacity now - the price was great so it wasn't a bad buy.
2	Product can be picky and works for some items and not for others. I think it is the wattage it puts out. Think for phone only and not for tablets.
2	This charger performs ok but I am still not a huge fan.  It is rather long and sticks out of the socket by almost an inch it also lacks a light diode indicator. The end result is that the fit is not snug enough and there's not way to tell if it charging or not without looking at the phone so I always have to double check to make sure it charges.  Cheap as it is I would not get it again.
0	I have been buying stuff from Amazon for a while and this is my first review. Sad to say not a good one. I was so hoping these would work but they will not pair to the Nexus S. Not sure if it is because of Gingerbread OS or not. I am returning and will look for some that will work.
2	I received this today.  It seemed to be charged because I got the flashing blue Bluetooth searching mode light to come on but it would not connect with any of my other Bluetooth devices.  I figured it might need a charge so I tried to plug in the included USB cable and no go it feels funny going into the headset connector and does not charge the unit.  I've asked for a replacement and will update this review based on that unit.UPDATE: 12/27/2010I received the replacement headphone and it connected right off.  Also the USB cable worked and the unit charged.  Sound quality is decent for inexpensive headphones and the range is good as well.  They are comfortable to wear.  I am using them for PC gaming and will probably get a bluetooth phono jack adapter and use them when I watch TV.If it wasn't that the original was received defective I would have probably rated these 5 stars from a value/performance basis alone.  As long as you buy items sold by Amazon you actually don't have to worry much about defective product because they will next day your replacement to you.So after a rocky start I'd now recommend that you give these a try.
2	Nothing more to say other then the title.Basically they're good for music.Very bad quality for voice calls. Other party hears everything but your voice.Bad engineering of microphone may be..My reviews are based on my experience with iPhone pairing.Also motorolla's bluetooth are good for phone but pathetic for music.So really concerned what next bluetooth headphone to buy...Unfortunately my head phone got stolen or lost else I would definitely return my current ones.Won't recommend to buy if you are planning to use it for voice calls.To the makers of this item (jWin) Is that a problem with only one headphone in particular - or that's all big bug?
0	Pretty cover until you put it on a black Iphone.  The black and the giant apple on the back of the phone ruins the barely discernable design.  Very disappointed.
2	I did not expect this product to jus be a slip on case. I expected a front and back piece as I had with all my cases. I think they should have showed that in the picture. The design on the back is very hard to see and it really only protects the back of your phone from scratches and doesn't protect the front at all. So I would not order this as a protective case just if you want a purple iPhone.
2	Yes it fits. Although it isn't as pretty as the pictured cover. I am disappointed I expected more.If it doesn't frustrate you that you are unable to easily access the buttons on your phone ( mute function volume controls power button etc.) and you don't care about high quality merchandise with a fat wallet to buy another phone when it breaks while using this product be my guest. Buy with pleasure.As for me I will be buying an Otterbox. I've used 3 each have survived me dropped it on the kitchen floor my toddler dropping it in her cereal bowl and the dog attempting to use it as a chew toy and my phone remained in near mint condition.
2	It was a tight fight into my phone and kept pushing my screen protector off of my phone. grrr. But the design was pretty and shipping was fast
0	These screen protectors are simply garbage and complete waste of money. I wasted all three of them and wasn't able to properly apply on the screen. It gets lots of bubbles and strange scratches on the sticky side and you can see these scratches on the screen when you finally apply them not mention all the dust that it catches from  the air. And most important thing is you can't take off little paper straps attached to them because they are glued so hard you have to use acetone to take them off. Don't waste your money look elsewhere.
2	I have ordered these covers before.  You need all three in the pack because it may take three times to get one installed perfectly without air bubbles and/or lint.  I was planning on using one for my phone and one for my wife's phone leaving a spare.  It took all three for just mine by the time I got it installed without bubbles or lint.  After about two months the screen protector began to peel up at the edges allowing more debris to get trapped between the protector and the screen.  The other problem is that these things must ship from the other side of the world on a slow boat.  It took so long for the order to arrive that I forgot I had ordered them.  Note: They arrive in a plain white envelope that can easily be mistaken for junk mail since it doesn't reference Amazon anywhere on the envelope.  After I installed the one on my phone I placed a second order so I could install one on my wife's phone.  The second ordered never arrived.  I e-mailed Amazon but never received a response. :(
2	This item is very useful and quite easy to place on the phone. I've been using this for about 3 months and the only problem I have with this is that it's starting to peel off but there's three in a package so if it does fully peel off then I can easily just place in a new one.
2	The screen fits well but if you look at it from the angle with the screen is off you can see a colored streaks. But it goes away when the screen is on. I guess I don't really look at the phone when the screen is off.
2	These screen protectors were okay but they were really hard to apply.  The cloth didn't really get them clean and I couldn't get them to stay on my phone right.
2	Hard to install correctly. they didn't quite fit the face of my screen and required some trimming to get the fit right. Not very effective as they become dirty easily and need to be changed way too often to make the effort of fitting to the screen worthwhile.
2	This screen protector for the Bold 9700 fits nicely on the BB screen.  However even though I thoroughly cleaned my screen with the included cloth I still have one air bubble on the right side that I can't get out no matter how much a try and crease it out to the edge.  Also along the left side I have a long air pocket but that could have been because I placed and replaced the left side of the screen a few times to get it aligned perfectly on my screen.  Hopefully the other screens don't have as many air pockets.  I don't know why the description of the item says Anti-Glare either there is the same amount of glare without the screen protector on.  Also if you look really closely there is a rainbow-like tint of vertical stripes on the protector.  When the BB screen is blank or off and there is a glare you can see the stripes.  It's not very noticeable unless you are looking for it but I just wanted to point that out since I've never seen that before on other protectors.UPDATE 1/25/10: I just tried putting on a second protector and it did the same there are air pockets all along the sides.  I think it is because the protector is too thick so it doesn't properly get out all of the air pockets.  Save your money and find another screen protector!
2	Bang for the buck.The product works as described.One month in so far so good may order another one soon.
0	These look exactly like Blackberry headphones. But I had a pair of the real Blackberry headphones and they worked. I bought 4 of these and NONE I repeat not ONE of them worked to an acceptable level. You could barely hear out of all of them and two of them had a crackle and distortion that I've never experienced on a headset and I've bought quite a few as I like to have at least 6 of them around a couple for the car one for my duffel bag one or two at work. I'm constantly misplacing them and if I have enough it seems like there is always one around as I only use my phone with a headset I never hold it to the ear as I'd rather talk hands free at all times....even for a short call.These are really really the worst of perhaps 20 - 30 that I have owned over the past 2 years.
2	Works as intended although this thing is nothing special in terms of looks or feel. Buy this if u are looking for a simple ear piece to use for ur phone.
2	I was not able to get on the foam cushions before they tore.  In terms of conform I liked these a lot better than the ones that came with my bby 9000.  The earbuds broke after a week so I do not recommend.  If I 3/4 insert the earbuds they work but the bby freaks out if I get a call.  I tried my old buds and they work fine so it is not a phone prob.
2	Although the sound quality in headphones is Ok the mic tends to muffle th voice a lot.
2	No real complaints with this one. It works but its not the most aesthetically pleasing or comfortable feeling headset around. Wires are very thin and of a hard plastic. I don't really use mine anymore (still mostly using my original iphone headset) but this one will work in a pinch.UPDATE AFTER DEATH OF EARBUDS:Got some reasonable use out of this. Finally broke after 10 months of on and off use (which is about as long as I expect any of my earbuds to last: about a year). Build quality is not great the rubber covers do pop out relatively easily. I extended its life probably twice as long as I should have kept it by crazy gluing them back on but I would say it was worth the rock bottom price I paid for it.
2	the product works as designed; however there are other products i have purchased on amazon that works better.  the microphone is a little large and clunky.  when using it as a headset you have to press on the center button to get more sound out of it...it's like its filtering or something.  good for a backup.
0	...if you have freakishly large ears!These things are WAY too wide to fit in your ears!And I'm not at all impressed with the sound.And the search continues.
2	These were just too big for me to use comfortably. In their default state they have no cushioning and are large and trying to install the included foam covers was very frustrating and the resulting amount of stretch means the foam is very thin and doesn't seem to add a thing to the comfort level.
0	I am very unsatisfied with the quality of this product. I did buy it because I found a great deal and they were really inexpensive. Now I know why. They really suck.  They do not stay in my ears constantly fall off and I get frustrated and try to jam them in my ears and that just ends up hurting myself.  They're horrible.  I am going to have to buy a new pair of headsets w/ mic I really do not recommend this product if you have sensitive ears or you talk w/ headphones for hours (They are not for you).
2	I use these with my LG Env Touch phone and I can hear people pretty clear on my end but the person I'm talking to complains that my voice goes in and out. But for $2 what do you expect?
2	I loved it at the beginning. Great price and worked well. More comfortable than bluetooth if you can manage the wire. But it didn't last more than a month. Now I can only listen music with it but speaking on the phone witch I really need. Shame.
2	I go through these things like hotcakes.  Honestly for the price I consider them disposable.  I prefer to stick with them as I like to be seen as ON THE PHONE instead of walking around talking to air.  With a bluetooth ear device people always tend to follow you around for a few minutes just to confirm that you are on the phone oh! they have a bluetooth! OR that person is NOT RIGHT and maybe we should go this way.  Either way they do the job:)UPDATED 2/2014:  I order from this seller fairly regularly.  Yesterday what I received was Blackberry compatible headsets but NOT OEM.  Their reply:  We are sincerely sorry for this rare oversight. I have brought this to my listings department who is fixing the listing as we speak. Please let me know if I can assist you further in any way.I guess I can't expect much else.  However I felt this a cheap China Ebay transaction...  I think I will go back to Ebay for this product they offer them cheaper and if I don't get OEM I'm not surprised.  Here on Amazon this was too expensive for this.
0	Although the earplugs worked well initially the rubber ring holding eachof them together comes off and the earplugs fell apart soon after purchase.
2	these headphones SUCK! they completely stopped working after 2 weeks and i didnt even use them alot DO NOT BUY! there are WAY better deals
2	This is a decent device. My only disappointment is that it won't play the bluetooth radio apps. I listen mostly to News/talk/sports so mono would be fine - but it seems the major apps &#34;Tune-in I-Heart&#34; etc. only transmit in the stereo mode and this device isn't compatible.Works well for phone calls good sound and voice - really ugly though - just like the picture!
2	It's halfway there.  Some other reviewers indicated a good volume heard by the callers.  Not so for me.  At least the mic is right in front of your mouth but I find that I have to talk very loudly for folks to hear.  If you were in a noisy truck as some reviewers were I can see that you'd be talking loudly already over the engine.Comfort is not good on my head.  The unit has a sharp piece of plastic on the piece that slides in and out to adjust size.  My bald head feels that more I suppose than someone with nice thick hair.Overall it's better than my other bluetooth headsets but I'm still disappointed in the low gain of the mic.
2	This headset works good as far as call quality on the other end. But it's uncomfortable and it doesn't fit on the ear like it should. Also the speaker is way too quiet I could barely hear the person on the other end especially when driving. I recommend zelher or blue parrot.
2	I purchased this to use while driving a passenger bus.  I find that it is comfortable while I have a ballcap on but I normally don't wear hat while driving.  The earphone volume is too low at Max volume and I cannot hear the whispered commands.  The ringtone is musical?!? I don't know if I can change it to a Ring but maybe it's possible.  People I call say that they can hear me as clearly as a landline phone without engine noise etc!  That's better than any bluetooth I have tried so far! I find that the battery life is less than 12 hours! And that's with very few calls.  But for the money it's a good bluetooth device and I'll probably buy another for use in my shop!
2	HORRIBLE  PRODUCT!!!  Worked well for a couple of months then simply stopped charging.  Have tried to charge it several times and on different appropriate chargers but it will not charge WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND.
2	Works good battery lasts much longer than expected.  Kind of flemsy but the price is right. I had to edit this review as I was only able to use the headset for about 10 times and it quit transmitting.  Can't find the receipt so in the trash it goes.
0	Worked great for 2 months and died. Trying the Blue Parrott now... Fantastic call quality and much more solid so far.
2	The Storm looks awesome.  It has a touch screen interface including a touch screen keyboard that appears when needed.  That can be tricky to get used to but overall is a pretty snazzy feature.  The phone has several apps preloaded I was able to get it to work with Gmail without any real trouble and the phone has some neat features that are pretty standard for quality smartphones.Unfortunately it has some serious cons.  It doesn't offer ways to quickly and cleanly shut down programs which leads often to the phone locking up.  You can't push one button to end a program you have to click scroll way down in a menu with several finger swipes and then click close.  Imagine clicking-scrolling a lot-and clicking again four times in a row just because you want to go from email to the web to a text message and back to a phone call.  That's silly.  But if you don't meticulously close programs the phone slows to a crawl and/or crashes.  Oh and did I mention it often takes a few minutes to even turn on after a crash?The phone also gets poor service in areas where other simpler phones get great service.  I had trouble getting service all over NYC - seriously a smartphone (on Verizon!) that has trouble in NYC?  That's not good.The phone also does strange things.  If you try to send a text message or other message while you have no service the phone often fails to ever send the message at all even if you have all your bars.  I've literally watched it fail to send a simple text message for 10 minutes and then I copy and paste the unsent text into a new fresh SMS and it immediately sends it with no difficulty.  That means the phone is being stupid.The Storm is a visually appealing phone with lots of cool features and a great touch screen.  But if you want a smartphone that is reliable efficient and consistent then you've got a better chance of being struck by lightning than being happy with your Storm.
0	I had a storm 1 first it was bad. I gave it away as it would have been dishonest to sell such a bad phone. I bought the storm 2 and it was better initially and then that too was ridiculous. Being unable to make calls because the phone was frozen or not being able to answer the phone because the screen wouldn't press was eternally frustrating. I'm through with blackberrys period wouldn't even give the torch a chance. I bought an HTC HD2 and booted android to it and it works beautifully. The only thing that I was concerened about missing was the BBMessenger but I've installed whatsapp and Cnected and they work beautifully and connect with blackberrys and any other phone! Good bye Black berry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	We've had two of these for about six months now and they've really been nothing but a disappointment.  Verizon has the best coverage in our area by far so this was the latest and greatest by Verizon at the time.  They've just never really worked reliably/consistently for any length of time.  Even the updates haven't brought these phones to where they should be as far as reliability.  When they work it's a great piece of technology.  But I constantly see my wife and daughter struggling to get basic functionality to work at a reasonable pace.  They shut it down they battery reboot they upgraded-sometimes it works for a day for so and then it starts again.
2	As of 5/22/09 this phone still has lot of glitches that are suppose to be fixed in a software update that was to come out months ago--which keeps getting pushed back.  The only reason I kept this phone rather than returning it for another is that I use verizon and can not get the I Phone.This phone has a screen that you first touch and then press to activate what you are touching.  I personally like that better than the I phone because I can be sure I am touching what I mean to be and then making the execution.  I also like the feel of pressing the keyboard down--especially when typing.  Some people prefer the I phone because it is faster.  One of the problems is that when you place a call and put the phone up to your cheek you can easily press the screen changing it to speaker or mute or some unknown thing that takes awhile to reset before you can hear the call.  You can fix this by purchasing an application that locks the screen.  The storms lock feature will not lock the screen during a call so you have to purchase this after market application.  Another thing is that the keyboard is hidden when you place a call so if you need to put in your password/numbers you need to look at the phone select the keyboard and it shows up.  It just isn't convenient or intuitive.Another extremely odd thing is that the phone turns off the signal all by itself randomly.  If you don't look at the phone you may not realize the signal is turned off (therefore you can't receive calls emails etc).  A software update is promised to fix this at some unknown time.  We purchased two Storms and both do this--a common problem according to verizon.  One of the phones does this about 1 time per day.  They other did it several times per day.  Verizon changed that storm out for a replacement storm.  So now both phones turn themselves off only about 1 time per day.Software is glitchy when it comes to notifications.  You can turn all sound off or turn it off for each individual thing.  If you turn it off for each individual thing sometimes it decides to make sound anyway.  According to verizon there is no fix for this--other than a hard reboot that erases everything but doesn't guarantee a fix--and in fact has never fixed ours.  So if we don't want the phone to randomly decide to make noise we have to turn all sound off.  Of course that includes the phone ring along with all the data rings.This phone is painfully slow although I can not compare it to other blackberry's as I have not had one before.  I could not do real work on it.  Luckily I am not a business user so there isn't anything that I can't put off until I can get to a computer.  I have tried looking at and editing word documents but have never had the patience to deal with it after waiting and waiting and waiting for them to load.  Likewise using internet is painful.A plus to blackberry is that you can use blackberry messenger to IM any other blackberry user that you are connected to (free connection--you just both have to agree to it).  This saves money on texting because you don't have to add that feature or you can get a smaller texting package.  We use blackberry IM all the time and love it.I sync up my blackberry to my mac computer--when it agrees to do it.  Again this seems like a random thing although it works about 90% of the time.  There could be lots of improvements in this sync however I can sync my phonebook (without categories) calendar and itunes.  I tunes is not as user friendly on this as the I Phone however if it isn't the main reason you have the phone it is tolerable.  If you want to search songs and change playlists or get creative though you won't want to do it on this phone.  The speakers on the phone have a very tinny sound if you try to play music through them.  It is annoying to me but I didn't buy the phone for good speakers so it isn't a big deal.The camera on the phone is fairly decent and has a flash.  Sometimes the flash washes out things too much--but again I didn't buy this phone for the camera so it is fine for me.  Most of the pictures sync with i photo without a problem although sometimes it says that they aren't recognizable.I love that it has a removable memory card.  It comes with 8 g but can be upgraded to 16.  Nice to only have to change a memory card rather than buying a whole new phone just to get more memory.There are not nearly as many apps for this as there are for I Phone and very few of them are free.  This may be fine for business users but it is frustrating for me.I love the look of the phone and the pre-loaded ring tones.  I also like the flexibility to move icons and put them in folders and customize the phone.This phone gets emails automatically and that is great.  No having to log in and check emails.The voice activated dialing works about 50% of the time without training.  I find myself not using this feature although there may be ways to customize it and make it work better.When the I phone comes to verizon I will replace this in a heartbeat.  Until then I feel like this is better than nothing.  Although based on some reviews I may be wrong--other blackberries may be better.  I am especially disappointed with how buggy this phone is and the promises of software fixes that never seem to come.  And this phone has been on the market for awhile.This is a buyer beware phone for sure.  It also falls into the category of settling until there is something better.UPDATE 7/26/09:  a new software update has fixed most but not all of the problems.  The biggest problem that remains is that you can accidently click the phone while on a call which results in muting or other problems.  POCKMAC for syncing with mac remains an issue but RiM is suppose to come out with their own software in sept. and that may fix the problems.  If running facebook on your blackberry you are more likely to encounter problems with the sync.  If you do on your blackberry go into options advanced options service book and then delete facebook with the cical next to it and that should fix it.  However sometimes you do have to go back and repeat the process.  I also noticed that on my new unibody macbook pro there are less issues with syncing than on my old macbook pro.  not sure why as it runs the same ox software.  but i am happy that it is finally syncing.  i do sync my itunes with my blackberry as well using pocketmac.on advantage to the blackberry over the iphone is that on the blackberry you can run multiple things at once.  so you could have your maps running directions make a phone call and return to maps without having to start over.  on the iphone you can't do that-at least that is what the apple store people told me.because of the improvements to the blackberry with the software upgrade the fact that i can use it with verizon and now pocketmac is working i would choose the blackberry over the iphone if i had to do it over again.  if iphone comes to verizon then i will have to make a decision.  if it still has the water vapor issue voiding the warranty however i will probably stay away from iphone until that is fixed.  (in case you aren't aware the iphone can stop working just from being exposed to humidity and sweat and it is not covered under apple warranty--it is causing a lot of problems for people as of this date).UPDATE 7/27/09:  for some blackberrys the software upgrade eventually crashes the system.  We own two blackberries it did this to one of them.  tech support at verizon said that it needed to be replaced or it would keep crashing.  the person at tech support said that happened to hers and when she got the replacement she hasn't had a problem.  we are choosing to wait one more time to see if it crashes again (has done so twice in 1 week and you have to reboot the entire system erasing everything on it).  verizon does replace the phone with a refurbushed one for free within the first year.  before you purchase one of these check the replacement policy that your carrier has.
2	The touch screen has serious issues I had it repaired several times. Dont waste time on this one buy something else.
0	I don't why it's so difficult to get a car mount for these smart phones but I thought I'd found the answer here. Unfortunately I should have seen Room112's video review first as he quickly nails all the problems.There are a number of major issues with this equipment:1. Unlike the product picture which leads you to believe the mount is separate from a cord to the cigarette lighter it's all one solid piece. This means that if your cigarette lighter is in the middle near the stick shift it's too low to view the phone safely. Alternatively if the cigarette lighter has an inset mount (like on a Honda CR-V) the phone has to lean forward making it near-impossible to view.2. Because the cigarette lighter provides the support for the entire unit and your phone it doesn't sit in the socket snugly in either case wobbles around constantly and falls out or disconnects without you noticing.3. The flexible neck is too flexible for the weight of the phone (HTC Hero) so it slowly collapses in either position. Given the weight of the Hero I'm not sure any phone would be light enough to stop this from happening.Conversely the FM-broadcast feature of this mount works just fine though as an aside for the HTC Hero you can't charge and listen to music through the audio jack at the same time. This isn't a fault of this mount but there's not much point in buying an FM-broadcast mount when you can't charge simultaneously so make sure your phone has both a USB and audio jack port available.So overall it's pretty disappointing - if anyone else has found a good mount for the Hero please leave me a comment!
2	After reading alot of the reviews I went ahead and purchased the Flexsmart mount for my Blazer and my 4g Mytouch. Like some many of the previous reviews the weight of the phone is the problem. As most smart phones these days mine is very heavy as well. Knowing this I went ahead and bought it. It was at my door in 5 days. California to Pittsburgh Pa in 5 days. Very happy. It was packaged very nice as well. My car has an extra Cig lighter for charging misc items and I was hoping to use that for the Flexsmart mount. Well that didn't work out because the flex stem isn't long enough. So I went to my local auto parts store and bought a new cig lighter socket. Hard wired it into the other outlet and mounted it UPRIGHT along the side of my center consol. Now it works like a charm. It holds the mount upright and my phone weight is a non issue.It works amazing tune your fm dial to a low channel that doesn't broadcast like 87.9 ect... I have alot of music on my phone and it's great when you can listen to music while it's charging and if  a call comes in the music is paused while the call comes over the car speakers. The mount has a microphone so when you speak with the caller it's all hands free.  Brilliant!So in closing anyone that can mount it upright will have no problems at all. I am uploading a pic of how it mounts in my car.  Excellent product excellent shipping and I did make a call to the company and spoke with a very helpful rep.  Highly recommend.OK After 3 or 4 months of use the part that goes into the cig lighter is wore out and it just spins freely. Totally bummed me out. Unable to use it at all. I'm hoping to contact the company and talk about a washer to slip on the end to make it tight again.  We shall see.... TBC
2	So I just recieved my Advanced Car Mount System FM Transmitter. Well let me start with what I have: A T-Mobile HTC G1 aka Dream HTC 3.5mm Adapter and a 2008 Mazda 6. In order to make this work is that you have to have the HTC 3.5mm adapter since the phone does not have a 3.5mm headset output. Plug in the USB cable with the Mini USB on the other end into the HTC adapter and into the FM transmitter. This allows for a power source then plug the 3.5mm headphone wire that comes with the FM transmitter to the 3.5mm cord that comes with your G1 and then plug that end into the 3.5mm adapter. Now that you have your adapter all plugged up now plug the 3.5mm adapter into the bottom of your phone and place into the phoneholder/fm tranmiter. Yeah it seems that there is a weird mix of wires everywhere but with a few zip ties you can take care of it. Turn your car on and find a station that works for you. The FM transmitter is very easy to work and it has an orange glow to it which isn't so bright that it lights up your car. Its just the right brightness. Now either find an MP3 to play or use Pandora. You will notice during MP3 that there is a buzz in your speakers but it seems to go away after a few mins and if you use Pandora you will here a buzz noise and some other noise. I think the noise you get from Pandora is because my Mazda 6 is picking up frequency from my phone downloading my station from Pandora. Now I tried this FM Transmitter in my Ford Explorer with an after market cd/mp3 player and this FM Transmitter makes so much noise that you seriously can not hear the song you are playing it is BAD. In my Mazda 6 it has the factory cd player so that might be why it works better in the Mazda then the Ford. But overall this FM transmitter works very well in the Mazda but not so well in my Ford. Also if you want to make your wire mess less messy. Go to the Android Market and download Toggle Headset.Build quailty seems Great!Design is Good!Reason for a 3 star because it does not work properly in my Ford w/ an after market cd/mp3 playerI feel after my purchase I feel comfortable enough to tell you all to go ahead and buy one. You will be pleased!
2	Customer Service was Great 100% money back.I couldnt find any stations in Philadelphia where I live.
2	This item has a lot of features that make sense when combined in a single product however it has several big flaws that make it marginal.First the FM transmitter is weak.  It works in one of my cars (Subaru) but not the other (Camry).  Both cars have no problems with radio reception.Second the mounting system is not practical.  Neither of my cars will accommodate it without some kind of extension on the socket.  A better approach would be a dash or vent mount.  The power socket should be used for power not support.I kept it mostly because I didn't want to bother packing it up and sending it back.
2	Nice concept but overall just a waste.  The music sounds scratchy and bad. The locking arms press on the volume buttons and power button... I just use it now for a car charger.
2	The title summarizes it all. The used one came with scuff marks scratches and small nicks in it; it is obviously used. I have already requested an exchange. I have high hopes for AccessoryOne to come through and expeditiously exchange the used cover. Once it is exchanged I will raise my rating of this product.
2	This is not OEM but it works. It's not what is pictured either. They sent a usb wall plug with a usb cable. Nowhere on this does it say LG or anything for that matter. Not the original charger that came with the phone.
2	worked great for about 6 months then cracked and broke. Had to order another one so I guess it was a waste of money
2	While I'm not sure where the responsibility lies for the mistake Amazon listed this under the category of Mini USB Chargers but it actually comes with a Micro USB cable that plugs into the device that needs to be charged.  Fortunately the cable can be swapped out of the wall/AC unit and I have a spare Mini-USB cable at home.  Other than that it looks OK.  For those who need to know the output is listed on the adapter as 5.1v at 0.7amps.  It would be helpful if Amazon listed these specs on its site.
2	I decided to switch a number of my applications from normal AA & AAA alkaline disposable batteries to the newer Eneloop LSD (Low Self Discharge) rechargeable batteries. When traveling with my camera for instance it would be good to have an easy way of telling which cells are fully charged and which are depleted and need charging. I saw these cases and thought wow a ready-made solution so I ordered a 5 pack. Shipping was fast and I got them in a few days. I like the fact that the price is a little high and includes shipping instead of what most vendors do: sell for a cheaper price and then charge an outrageous shipping fee - often more than the cases themselves.When I received them I loaded my charged batteries in them. They worked great. The clasps which didn't seem that good actually worked well (I cut off the round tongue with the hole for hanging in a retail display). They hold 4 AA batteries or 4 AAA batteries but not in combination i.e. they will not hold 2 AA and 2AAA batteries. I thought that was a clever design so I ordered another set.On the way to put the loaded cases on my battery shelf I dropped one my garage floor the case sprung open and the batteries spilled out. I found that the piece of the locking latch with the rectangular hole had broken off. I now only have 4 working cases and this confirmed my earlier suspicion that these are made from the wrong plastic material. It's too brittle and I expect more failures (without dropping them). These should be made from something like polyethylene (I think) like most other small free battery cases that come with many battery sets and/or cameras.Then I read another review on these cases and someone commented that these cases are thicker than they should be because there are other cases that are only as thick as the AA batteries and hold the AAA batteries (without rattling around) crosswise between the AA dividers. My freebie AA case that came with my camera won't do that but I got to thinking that's true. So now I'll have 9 of these orange cases with the possibility of them all breaking because of the plastic they're made from and will probably look for the thinner cases...And on further reflection why is it so cool to have a case that can hold either AA or AAA batteries (but not in combination)? I have a known quantity of AA batteries and a known quantity of AAA batteries - why not just have as many (dedicated) cases for each? I guess if I was going on the cheap I could have fewer cases and load them with the ones I need at the time...Okay in summary 3 stars for being a brittle plastic and being thicker than necessary.Updated 8/4/11 - To the seller's credit within a few days of posting this review I received 3 new battery cases at no charge along with a nice note from the seller - apparently because of the one I dropped and broke. Quick and courteous action on their part! Chalk up one for great customer service; they apparently read the reviews and take them seriously. Unfortunately upon opening the envelope they were sent in the side of one of of the cases was broken off and lying loose in the envelope. Like I said earlier wrong (brittle) plastic.
2	The latch is an inferior design not intended for heavy repeated use.  However the product is well suited otherwise for storing charged rechargeable batteries of either AA or AAA which is handy if your rechargeable supply available for reuse is unpredictable.  It can be used for storing ones needing a charge although it is radically better to charge rechargeables before storage.  It takes 100% consistency in the battery direction to use for both charged and discharged batteries.
2	The battery lasts as long as the OEM battery that first came with the phone. It says that it'll last longer with the more charges but I haven't seen any change and I have this widget on my phone that shows the estimate time of battery life that I have left and it shows the same amount of hours per each battery; stock & the seidio. Waste of money.
2	I bought two of these and two desktop chargers so that I could always have a fully charged battery to swap into my Droid Incredible since it goes through batteries like crazy.  Although this battery is rated higher than the OEM battery that came with my phone I am not detecting that it actually lasts any longer.  It seems to function the same.
2	Definitely the extra capacity over the original HTC Pro 2 battery is not what I was expecting. I'm feeling I have the same original battery that came with my phone.
0	August 23 2011 Update. Well it lasted maybe 9 months before my phone started randomly rebooting. I thought my phone had gone bad. But it turns out this battery is not physically as long as the OE battery so it loses contact with the phones  battery contact pins. Then... reboot. And I see that many others have experienced this as well. The best battery management plan I have found is buying a charger battery package off eBay. its a GaliliO DPD T7373 2000 mAh battery. 2 battery's and a charger for about $10. Keep the spare battery in your pocket.Original Post:I bought this battery for my EVO 4G because I wanted to get as much battery life from my phone as possible. This phone is powerful so it does need some help in the battery department. I also installed the power widget to be able to easily toggle off GPS Bluetooth wi fi and dim the screen when not in use. The results have been great. I went a whole day yesterday and still had 50% battery available after 12 hours. Even though I did the same sort of power saving settings on my iPhone 3GS my battery would have been dead by 3PM. The OEM EVO battery would have been dead by 3PM also. By comparison to my iPhone and the OEM EVO battery I am very happy. As others have mentioned the battery life does get better with time. A serious must have with an EVO user. And now I have a fully charged backup OEM battery available which I never had as an option with mi iPhone.And the best part? A year from now when this battery is starting to lose its capacity to hold a charge I can get another and I'll be back like new again. That wasn't an option with my old iPhone without sending it off for an expensive battery swap.
2	Works as advertised (hence the 3 stars) however a few things really really bug me.1. The iPhone sticks up higher than I'd like. I'd like the connector to be recessed a little bit lower.2. The silver isn't what it looks like in the Amazon photos. Sitting next to my alum Macbook Pro and my alum keyboard this cradle looks more like cheap silver spray paint.  It's brighter and more reflective. It's almost enough to return it if it weren't for the fact that it works well.I'd recommend getting black or another color if you think the silver should match your other Apple products.
2	UPDATED: the otterbox defender is to thick for this charger. The slope of the back starts way to early...This is a great looking design... good for the otterbox cover and any other cover that allows direct contact to the metal around the iDevice... however the plastic clip does make me nervous about the clip just breaking through the hole in the metal.If you have a case of cover that blocks you from seeing the metal around the iDevice charging port[...] then you will need a dock extender to leave the case on. Most cases/bumpers have a small plastic or rubber cover around the charging port that ONLY allows some charging cords to make the connection viable.If your case allows you to see the charging port and around the charging port metal then you should love this charger otherwise find a dock extender or grind the plastic insert down to allow the connection to be completed.Once you plug the wire into the plastic holder it is blocked on both ends shortening the male end about 1/16 of an inch... so if you have anything blocking the top of the plastic clip from making DIRECT contact with your idevice the male end does not seed deep enough to actually charge the phone... you need a good extender for this to work.
0	Had to return this item will not work will with Element cases that my family uses on iPhones.  Looks good from a distance but when you get close the workmanship is poor and the connectors never seemed to stay in place.  Pass on this one!
2	Ok the product works HOWEVER...I ordered black and it was deep green with speckles. They do not even offer this color which tells me someone mixed up the paint code... but they still sold it. HMMMM! So I painted it right myself.Next before I decided to paint the dock those black grommets kept falling out. So I took them out before painting and re-glued them back into place after the paint was dried. Same with the plastic piece for holding the wire in place... need to glue that or it will push down and your iPhone/iPod will not make 100% connection.I wrote the company but no response. I wanted to order another one but I wanted to make sure I did not have same problems... They never responded!All-In-All the docking station works with a little hidden glue however it was not worth the high price.
2	I recently bought this dock mainly for my iPhone 4s. The dock is made of a nice aluminum just like the iMac. The bought the black one. I am currently using an Otterbox Communter case with my iPhone 4s. Since this dock's connector is so close to the back end and doesn't come up too much it is impossible to make this work for my case. Now without a case it works perfectly fine. So if you are trying to buy this dock keep in mind alot of cases simular to the Otterbox Commuter Series case will not work with this docking station. You might want to check out the Konnet iCrado NEO that one is a better buy in my own opinion.
0	Light weight so undocking is a two handed task and it moves around my desk. Only fits certain iPhone cables.
2	LUCE BIEN PERO SOLO ES UN CARGADOR CUANDO BIEN PUDIERON HABERLO DISE&Ntilde;ADO PARA QUE INCLUSIVE PERMITA LA SINCRONIZACION QUE SERIA LO IDEAL PORQUE UN STAND DE ESCRITORIO COMO ESTE NO TIENE MUCHO SENTIDO PONERLO EN LA COMODASIN EMBARGO CREO QUE INVOLUCRARIA REDISE&Ntilde;AR LA BLACKBERRY TAMBIEN ;-)
0	It was difficult to keep the blackberry in a position to charge it effectively. There is no positive alignment between the phone base and the charger. This just didn't get the job done reliably enough for me. after a week I grew tired of checking to see if the phone was charging or not and tossed this in the round file. This isn't even a good paperweight.
2	Usually does not start charging right away.  I need to jiggle the phone to make sure the contact is made and it starts charging.  My previous BB charging pod for Bold 9000 had a much better fit
2	It has some inconveniences first it charges too slow secondly you can't keep the phone charged under constant use since you have to be picking it up. Is great for bed tough.
2	pro: bright and shinycons: not a phone too thick to fit credit card slot of a shredderThe Droid is probably best considered an overweight flash drive with bluetooth.It has no controls worthy of the name.One might fantasize that a stylus could offer an illusion of controlbut iPod/iPhone reviews suggest that styluses are effectively incompatible with capacitive touch screens.A phone should have a grip place to speak and place listen so zero for three.Fully charged before turning off: two days later the battery was flat.This appears to be related to (and can be repeated by) selecting full power downwhile in airplane mode then storing in the Verizon holsterwhich by the way has cutouts which in no way correspond with connectors.We have seen the battery go from fully charged to flat over night in this way.Leaving the Droid in sleep mode on the other hand barely discharges the battery.For dependable wireless communications (that is why you chose Verizon right?)you will need to also carry a real cell phone.  Voice communications arenearly unintelligible mostly resembling grunts and mumbles.Droid Wi-Fi appears to confuse our NETGEAR WGR614v6;for the initial connection each day we now have to power that wireless router off and onto re-enable 802.11g access for any of our wireless devices.If you are the sort of person who prefers their SLR with a battery gripor appreciates why real typists chose the IBM Executive to Selectricthen move along nothing to see here.The LCD seems quite nice until your eyes tire of focusing on things no more than 8 inches away.
0	Not a very good phone and Android is a work in progress.The physical keyboard is unusable and the onscreen keyboard is not much better.  iPhone keyboard is much better especially in wide screen.Laggy!  You can't even scroll the home screen without lag.You can only install a few hundred MB of apps.  Thats all.  Seriously.Touch screen not as sensitive or accurate as the iPhone.Syncing of data and multimedia not very good other than basic Google services.Can't do data and voice at the same time.  Thats a Verizon issue though.  Verizon also charges a fortune if you cancel your contract early so you better be really sure you want this phone.
2	I really wanted to love my MOTO DROID and got two of them trying to get one with speaker and sound that I could depend on.  People kept saying it sounded like I was mumbling from the bottom of a well with a bandana tied around my head talking on a tin can on a string.  In short after several software tweaks using only the blue tooth taking off the hard case and losing a lot of love and patience I traded for the HTC Droid Incredible. It does everything the Moto Droid did and more.  The Droid has so many design flaws.  The voice speaker is located in a trough that I think helps create an echo; the slide-out keyboard makes it heavy; it's uglyclumsy and masculine to look at...heavy & hard to hold up to your ear; it had no joystick to correct the many errors that happen on the way too sensitive virtual keyboard...you have to delete the whole word back to the incorrect letter that made you going backward almost as much as going forward. And the battery drain was awful.  I did find that the advanced app killer helps with that by closing all apps from running until you want them to run.  (also turn off blue tooth & wi-Fi when not in use) I would not recommend this phone unless you are a tekkie and can tweak it to make sure it isn't too sensitive and that the speaker is OK.  It might be cheap tinny speaker quality but more than likely its the software that needs tweaking.  Mine had the 2.1 update but I think Verizon made some proprietary adjustments that keep this phone from being stable and consistent.  Love having the mini computer features but what good is it if the basic phone part is unreliable?  Not ready for prime time...IMHO.  Cher  PS  The HTC Droid Incredible is totally awesome.  It does everything the Moto Droid does plus it's sleak sexy lighter and has a smokin' hot 1GhZ snapdragon processor that'll make your head spin around....Same price.  Make the trade.  O and BTW...don't forget to download & READ the 238-page user manual to get a clue.  LOL!
2	I purchased a new Verizon Droid from a Verizon store 8 days ago. It is AMAZING! However the most basic requirement is not met. People are constantly telling me that I sound muffled and unclear. One person refuses to speak to me if I'm calling from the Droid. I Googled Droid and bad audio and came up with over 1100 hits!!! They KNOW they have a problem but are unwilling to fix it. I must drive 3 hours to exchange this phone for another and hope it works. The Motorola technician tried a cure and it worked for one day then failed. On speakerphone it sounds GREAT but with the normal phone it is not acceptable. If the second one does not work then I'll go back to a normal phone. It is VERY difficult to reach a person at Verizon or Motorola that TRULY wants to help out. I'm always told send it back for a refurbished one!! Right I spent a fortune on this phone and I'm going to accept a used one? I don't think so. All true.
2	My first Android phone was a G1 on T-Mobile.  I actually feel like that phone was far easier to use and more practical than the Droid.  Two reasons for that.  One is that the physical keyboard on the G1 is far better than the one on the Droid. I never use the keyboard on the droid its terrible has no raised keys and is hard to use. The second reason is that there is no dedicated answer/end call buttons. I've lost count how many times I can't seem to slide the thing to answer a call or I have to fumble through menu screens (unlock screen bring call to foreground because my desktop is showing instead) just to hang up a phone call.  It shouldn't take so much effort to hang up the phone!The other issue is that the screen suffers from glare far more than the G1 ever did.  I can't use the phone outdoors if there is any sunlight at all.  I'm not talking about direct sun on it I have to be in the shade to use the phone and even then its a bit hard to read.Overall I am disappointed in the Droid and this new direction Android phones have taken. The G2 looks to have the same button layout as the Droid which makes me sad.
2	***7/16/10 Update*****Well it's been six months with my Droid and here are my observations:In general the phone has been pretty solid.  It works WONDERFULLY as a phone which is the primary duty.  Internet and 3G performance are fast and never seem to lack coverage. I've had no problems connecting to several different types of Bluetooth devices.  I took excellent footage at a recent concert so the cameras (video and still) are pretty good.  The app developers are doing a lot better and I'm starting to see more quality apps emerge on par with the offerings from iTunes (although the Android Market still has a ways to go).  The difference is that more established developers are cross-developing for both platforms now.  If I had to make a phone purchasing decision all over again today I'd probably get the Droid X or HTC Incredible (obviously this Moto Droid is now dated unless they offer it for nothing or next to nothing.  The point is I'd still choose an Android phone.  More on that later...)It can't all be peaches and cream so here are some shortcomings I've encountered:Software updates are slow to come.  It's not even so much that they're slow to release so much as slow to release for all Android phones.  Imagine if Microsoft released new versions of Windows based on your computer manufacturer.  Different manufacturers get different dates.  HP gets the latest Windows in January Dell gets it in March Acer in September...  That's what it feels like to watch newer Androids or the Nexus (more on that later) get the updates first and the rest of us wait our turn.  I waited forever for Flash 10.1 for Android only to discover it only works with Android 2.2. And Moto Droid doesn't have it and won't for the foreseeable future.  So much for the so-called Flash advantage.  This thing digests Flash about as well as an iPhone or iPad right now.There are some glitches that have stuck around for an alarmingly long time.  One of the biggest is the random disappearance of contacts from both my device and online contact list.  A contact (or several) will just randomly disappear from both places.  Other people have complained of this and I've had the problem since first purchasing the phone in February.  I thought it was me until it started recently occurring again. This alone caused me to bump a star off.  I needed to contact someone in a hurry only to find them deleted from my phone and online contacts.  This could be catastrophic if you're not around a backup contact list.  Another long-lived glitch is the inability to properly clear your tracks in the market.  Every search you ever make in the market is saved FOREVER.  So if you or someone fiddling around with your phone makes a search the search term remains in the history with no way to clear it other than a third-party app that I'm reluctant to try.  I can't believe they haven't fixed this yet.  Just imagine if EVERY web search you've ever made was saved with no way to clear it. All someone had to do was hover over the search field and every search ever made by you appeared.  That would kinda stink of lack of privacy wouldn't it?  Well there you go.Battery life seems to have gotten shorter as the apps increased even regularly using a task killer.Skype Yahoo and other apps break when wi-fi is enabled (skype - wi-fi = what's the point?...)I'm also tired of Google being more focused on their own branded Nexus than other Android phones.  It almost seems as if Google only cares about the Nexus and the other Android phones are an afterthought.  I understand The Nexus is their phone and all but if that's how they choose to treat other phones then they should have kept their OS to themselves.  They're trying to have their cake and eat it too.So with all this said why would I still buy another Android?  Because it's the only option on Verizon right now and I'm hopeful they Google will get their stuff together. Google really needs to quit trying to match iPhone sales with Android devices and focus on tweaking the OS and improving the update system.  My disdain for AT&T; prevents me from ever returning to them but if Android doesn't get some of these annoying issues resolved in the near future I'll definitely go my previous iPod Touch/Blackberry/regular phone route again. Yes it stinks to have to carry so many devices to make sure stuff gets done correctly but my patience is wearing thin.  On second thought make that a TWO star drop....**4/16/10 Update**I've had the Android 2.1 update a couple weeks and all my email issues are resolved.  Both IMAP and POP mail configured quickly and easily.  All of my folders now appear and all mail is accessible.  Although I didn't initially have issues with IMAP mail and wi-fi it eventually reared its ugly head.  Enabling wi-fi results in authentication issues not only for email but things like Facebook as well.  When you attempt to open these apps it says you're logged out or have a bad username/password.  Accessing these features over 3G only resolves this.  Now that my ONLY complaint is out of the way on to the remaining good stuff.  The 2.1 update also introduced some other welcome additions such as live wallpaper.  Live wallpaper is animated wallpaper that interacts with you.  My current fave is the grassy field that actually corresponds with the actual time of day.  If it's daylight outside it's daylight on the Droid.  If it's sunset or nighttime it also shows on the Droid.  It's pretty cool and  very accurate.  Multi-touch like pinch to zoom was also finally introduced to more features like the browser and pictures.  It's not bad and is certainly welcome but still has a ways to go and still isn't anywhere near as good as on the iPhone.  Then again iPhone is on revision 3 and this is only Android 2.1 Droid 1.0.  Besides it's not like the magnify button is useless.  There's also a new weather/news widget.  Although I still prefer the more detailed Weather Channel widget it's nice to have a native option.  The picture/video gallery is also improved and sleeker.  I see where Google is attempting to make the Android experience as slick as the iPhone experience.  And even though it's still a work in progress; as an owner of both phones I still prefer the Droid due to the increased versatility.  There are a few more features included in the 2.1 update that I haven't used yet (such as a new night display mode in GPS) but the features I've had the chance to try so far have been worth the upgrade.  Contrary to some reports I haven't experienced any slowdown in games.  I own Home Run Battle Raging Thunder Jewellust and many other games.  They seem to play no differently than they did on Android 2.0.1.  I'll keep you posted on any significant findings that I encounter with Android 2.1.** My original review below **Well I've been playing with my new Droid for a little while now and here are my findings.Email:This was my biggest letdown on the Droid. The Droid works great with Gmail.  However if you plan to use any other mail service (like Yahoo Hotmail or even POP accounts) get ready for some serious frustration.  I encountered major issues.  It's very telling that there are two separate mail icons one for Gmail and one for all other mail accounts.  The random problems with web mail (inability to configure accounts missing sub-folders mail sometimes not downloading old mail re-appearing constant false notifications for non-existent new mail...) are well-documented on the web so I won't go into boring detail.  However the real surprise was when I confidently thought I'd bypass all these headaches with my POP-enabled plus mail account.  I was initially able to configure and download mail.  It didn't display my subfolders (which the iPhone does) and occasionally mail would stop flowing. To make matters worse I frequently got new message alerts and a new mail icon despite no new mail arriving.  I did want to be notified of new mail but hated all the false alarms.  My options were limited.  I could either tolerate the false alarms disable them or delete the account.  I tired to tolerate the false alarms but after the umpteenth false alert at 4am I finally deleted the mail account from my device and settled for accessing all of my email over the web in the Droid's browser (Nothing like paying extra for POP access that you can't use.)  On the plus side if you use Gmail it will automatically sync all mail contacts tasks etc from Gmail.  It also integrates nicely with your Facebook contacts (if you choose) and will export pictures and other Facebook info to your contacts.  I really wish the Droid worked as well with other accounts as it does with Gmail.  Also I hope they get on the ball with sub-folders.  Not everyone likes the label manner in which Gmail sorts messages.  Some of us like good old fashioned sub-folders.  Hopefully the mail issues will be addressed soon in upcoming OS updates.Web Browsing:The browser on the Droid is fast and renders nicely. Although there is no multi-touch feature in the browser (yet) the feature just appeared in the latest revision of Google Maps so I'm pretty confident it'll show up in the browser sometime soon. It's rumored to be part of the upcoming 2.1 Android update.  The Droid also supports Flash.Communication tools (Texting Facebook Mebo etc):Although I like the iPhone's slick Facebook app just a wee bit better Facebook on the Droid is a very close second.  There are plenty of good apps available for Twitter Mebo etc.  Texting on Droid is great and conversations are presented in a chat style format. A picture of the user will also appear with the text message if you've setup pictures on your contacts.  There is also a built in chat/IM client but I prefer texting because it essentially looks and acts the same.Phone/Carrier:The bottom line of all these devices is the phone. The Droid does not disappoint.  Coverage is great in my area and clarity of calls is nice and clear. Ringers are loud and the vibrate mode has a nice solid vibration to alert through clothing.  Caller ID will show a caller's photo as well as number.  3G service is fast and readily available.  I notice only a slight difference in speed when switching between wi-fi and 3G mainly when using things like Google maps (maps re-draw a tad slower on 3G). I played random Youtube videos over both 3G and wi-fi and didn't experience any stuttering or delays in either mode.Operating System/Apps:The Android OS is a powerful operating system.  It is capable of multitasking which was one of my major gripes with the iPhone.  I hate being forced to quit what I'm doing if I want to do anything else.  The Droid does a good job at memory management and contrary to popular belief does not require task killers or app management software.  Most of the time poorly written apps are to blame for any problems (like apps that hijack the GPS at the wrong time and prevent location services from properly functioning) rather than Android's memory management.  If you're careful about what you install you'll be fine.  The Droid market is full of nice paid and free apps.  Although it may not currently have  100000 available apps there are still thousands of entertaining and useful apps including some (like game console emulators) that can't be found on other more restrictive platforms like the iTunes store. The freedom of the Droid market gives you a much better selection of apps without the need to jailbreak (or as they call it in the Android world root) your phone and risk voiding your warranty.  App purchases are handled through Google checkout.  There is no option yet for direct billing to your phone bill.Camera:The 5-megapixel camera is okay.  It's a bit (audibly) noisy laggy and shows noticeable noise in all but the best of lighting.  It has a built-in LED flash.  The camera will get the job done in a pinch but don't expect it to be a replacement for a regular digicam even at 5MP.  I'd rather have smaller sharper photos at 3.2MP than larger fuzzy photos at 5MP.  Video recording is not bad but not exceptionally good either.  Video seems a little better than average phones but it's not going to compete with a flip or a dedicated pocket video camera any time soon.  There are no built-in photo editing tools to speak of (although there are a couple nice photo apps available in the Android market).  The media gallery is okay but I don't like the fact that all media is lumped into one central folder even if you store them separately in different folders.  For example you could have one folder of pictures named My public pics and one folder of pics named My private pics.  Well if someone pics up your phone and opens the  All Pictures folder they'll see every pic on the phone. File management apps seem to be the workaround if you want to keep some things private or not readily viewable on the phone.Navigation:This is one of the best features.  The Droid uses Google Maps which includes turn-by-turn GPS navigation FREE!  No subscription to navigation service is required.  A side-by-side test with a Garmin proved the Droid to be just as reliable.  The days of punching in addresses are over.  Simply speak the address into the Droid and Google voice search will find it map it and even give you a street view photo of it if you choose.  Another good thing is the fact that Google Maps is constantly updated.  Say goodbye to purchasing map updates for your GPS.  And given the fact that all of the data is fed by Google you can pretty much find any point of interest in existence.  There are a few nice car windshield mounts out there that will automatically place the Droid in navigation mode when the Droid is inserted (This feature is activated by magnets in both the mount and the Droid.  Make sure you read more about that below).  The Droid also has Google Latitude which will show you the location of friends with GPS enabled phones that have Latitude enabled. With Google Maps navigation and Latitude that's two less services (VZ Navigator and Family Locator) you have to spend money on.  The GPS can also be utilized by apps for everything from localized weather to cool apps that will trigger your phone to do certain things (like launch reminders go into silent mode etc) when you enter specific geographic areas.Music:Obviously the iPhone beats the Droid hands-down in this area.  Honestly can anything really compete with an iPod turned into a telephone?  The Droid features a so-so music player and standard headphone jack.  Bluetooth headphones will also work.  It does support quite a few formats (including MP3 WAV AAC MIDI OGG and WMA).  The Droid doesn't support DRM so you might be in trouble if you have a lot of protected iTunes music.  Music is copied to the Droid through simple drag and drop from your computer (same with any other files you wish to copy to the Droid).  You can either attach the Droid to your PC via the included USB cable or remove the micro-SD card and copy directly to it.  I prefer the cable because the card is located inside the battery compartment under the battery.  That means popping off my case and removing the battery whenever I need to transfer files.  The USB cord is much simpler and faster.  Once on the Droid music is well organized and you can create playlists etc.  It's like any typcial MP3 player just not as nice as the iPod/iPhone.  The Droid comes with a 16GB micro-SD card but can support cards up to 32GB.Ergonomics and customization:The Droid is a solidly built phone.  It is a little on the heavy side.  It features a slide-out keyboard but I find the keys a little cramped with too little tactile feedback.  As a result I use the on-screen keyboard 99% of the time.  The sliding design makes it a bit difficult to find nice cases for the phone that offer a perfect blend of protection and ease of use. But rule number one when looking for a Droid case is: DO NOT BUY A CASE WITH MAGNETS (sorry for shouting.  Just wanted to make that clear).  As I said above the navigation mode on the Droid is automatically activated by magnets.  If you place your Droid near magnets (for example in a case with magnetic closures) it will stay in GPS mode never sleeping screen fully lit and thus very quickly draining the battery.  As old-fashioned as it sounds velcro or zippers are the way to go.  I opted for a two-piece Seidio fitted case for the body (which fits perfectly) and a Lowepro Volta 30 case for carrying the phone.  They work nicely together and fit comfortably in my front pants pocket.  The Volta is molded from rigid foam so it offers plenty of protection for the Droid's screen.  I also use screen protectors although I've seen enough evidence that the Droid's screen is extremely scratch resistant.  One brave chap even made a YouTube video of himself performing a scratch test on his new Droid by vigorously scratching his keys against the glass.  The glass was unscathed but the body lost a little paint.  The Droid has a large bright razor-sharp screen.  The touch screen is very responsive.  The home screen can be customized with different wallpapers shortcuts and widgets.  It can can be further customized in many different ways through third party apps and widgets.Conclusion:There are a lot of other features that I didn't touch on but I've rambled long enough to hopefully give you an idea of my experience with the Droid.  It's still a work in progress but I like the direction so far.  Although I do wish the Droid's email was at least on par with the iPhone (which handles mail accounts and sub-folders with no problems)  I'm optimistic this will be addressed in the near future.  The Droid also has a few other new kid on the block warts which are significantly exposed by the iPhone's polish; but the Droid also has its share of advantages over the iPhone (multitasking interface customization app freedom Flash support user-replaceable battery and better file compatibility are a few examples).  I also realize that this is Droid 1.0 vs iPhone 3GS.  I can live with the Droid being the inferior music player  compared to the iPod because that was not my primary reason for buying it. However music playback on the Droid is not bad and it is a realistic option for those who want to consolidate devices.  (Don't worry Apple I still favor my iPod over all else for that purpose).If they can resolve the email issues and a few other minor annoyances The Droid would be the perfect phone.  The upcoming Android 2.1 update has me very optimistic that most of my minor gripes will be resolved.  Regardless of the few quirks the Droid is a ton of fun to use and is almost impossible to put down once you start playing around on it.
2	The Motorola Droid is great except that Bluetooth voice dialing is disabled which could be a safety factor.  I have several complaints filed against Verizon Wireless however for limiting connectivity for Alltel customers and not honoring retention promises.  With this phone you have to consider the carrier as well.  The complaint details are available in the Wall Street Journal community page.  The price of a phone is the smallest part of what you pay with a 2 year commitment.[...].I am not sure if links are allowed but if you go to the Wall Street Journal COMMUNITY website and do a search for Verizon then it is right there.  You do have to go to the journal community site to find it.If you do get this phone there are many apps that allow you to keep the battery life from being wasted.  Many great apps are free.The complaints that I have filed are: FTC complaint # 25257585 NCDOJ Complaint # 1001670 FCC complaint 10-C00194123RegardsSteve Winter
2	Switched from a Verizon Blackberry Storm to the Motorola Droid. It's a great phone and for E-mail. Large clear screen and very workable touch screen keyboard.  So far I have not needed to use the slide out keyboard that was one of the features that attracted me to this phone. I like it for these features.My complaint is that the Droid will not sync with Outlook for your contacts.  I have heard there is an AP that will let you do this.  Worse for me is that the phone does not have the ability to sync with other devises via Bluetooth.  So if you have an in car navigation system you can not transfer your phone contacts to that system.I recently got a Motorola Motonav system from my second vehicle.  Although both units are made by Motorola they will not sync together.....THIS SUCKS....Motorola needs to upgrade the software on this phone.  So be aware that although it's a good phone it won't sync via Bluetooth or with Outlook.  BIG MISTAKE by Motorola.  Had I realize the above I'd likely have gotten a different phone.  Now I'n stuck for my two year contract.
2	Didn't like this at all.  Kept shutting off and when it did work the volume was too low.  Move on intrepid shopper!
2	Appeears to work well. Long battery life but the earpeice is uncomfortable after and hour or two.
0	I just purchased 2 of these in June and now neither of these are working on our brand new HTC Incredible phones. The call quality was poor right from the beginning and phased out until I had to literally yell to be heard. I got very tired of doing that & just stopped using mine & my husband ended up doing the same very shortly thereafter. I was bummed because it fit in my ear well & the plastic that went over the ear is thick so it won't break easily like our last two did. Of course they both died after the 30 day warranty. :(
0	After reading a lot of reviews I felt confident this would be a great item since they passed the law that you have to have a hands free headset to talk on the cell phone while driving. I was a little wary of the overall design but I charged it up. Friends said the they had some troubles hearing me at times it picks up alot of background noise. but that doesn't matter now since IT DIED AFTER TWO WEEKS! Now it's a useless piece of junk.
2	This headset worked well for me for the 1.5 years that I've had it. Call quality was good battery life was good.The problem with it is the rubber ear hook. It WILL unstick from the black plastic part of the hook. Mine fell off only after 2 months and I stuck it back together with super glue. It worked and held together for a couple months after than until recently the rubber broke which will make it almost impossible to repair.I wish there was some way to get the parts needed to replace the ear loop. Its seems like a total waste just to have to have to throw away my working BT headset because of the faulty ear piece.If may eventually have to look into getting a replacement headset. I'm looking at the Plantronics M100Plantronics M100/R Bluetooth HeadsetWarrenTrinidad & Tobago
2	It is a good handfree for the price it is !It don't reconnect automatic once you leave the car and come back you need to reconnect ...manually !Apart of that good sound and clear voice !
2	I was a little disappointed with my purchase but I can't blame the vendor. I wanted a bluetooth device that answered the phone as well as serve as a bluetooth car speaker for my wife's phone. This is just for answering the phone. It does a decent job at that. It came with a car charger USB cable wire hanger to hook it up onto the visor. My wife did not like it but I gave it to my daughter and see likes it!
2	this product is an old item sold by sprint when blutooth first came out. it does hook up easy but the speaker you can't hear out of very loud. i wouldn't recomend. i gave my two i bought away.
2	The cable works as advertised but I would be careful when using with any new iOS device (iphone 4 or iPad) since it tends to overheat your device. Maybe it's a problem with just the cable I received but either way it did not feel good to touch an extremely hot iPhone 4. I thought my processor would burnt out.
2	The RAdTach Procable 19 inch Dock Extender works only part way.  So here's the situation: I have an iPhone 4s that is enclosed in a LifeProof protective case and I must use a RadTech 13-860 ProCable Shortz Dock Extender for iPhone iPod and iPad - Black to charge or sync my device.  So back to this white 19 inch dock extender:  I tried using this as an extender for my wall charger and my iPhone will not charge with it. Once I remove the 19-in dock extender then the phone will charge.  I've also tried this on mySony ICF-C1IPMK2 Speaker System and Clock Radio with iPod Dock (Black) so I could plug in the extender to the clock radio and then my iPhone.  In this way the weight of my heavy iPhone wouldn't put so much stress on the iPhone connector.  The result was that I could turn on and play the song through the radio on my iPhone but could not use the Sony stereo/radio to control the song tracks.  I even tried this with another 4th Gen iPod Nano and same result.  So this product only partially works and then it's only marginal.  (Not recommended!)
2	works as desired - however - I still had to sand down the sides to fit to iphone case - now you could argue its the case at fault but I was hoping for a slimmer fit that would match the OE charging line from Apple
2	I purchased three of this item to have them handy for travel and in the car.  After two weeks one pulled apart and another does not always connect as expected so my phone does not charge.
0	BewareThis cable can only transfer data from a PC.  It cannot charge the Droid when EITHER plugged into a PC or into the wall charger.Look elsewhere....
2	The cable from Abacus 24-7 works as both a charge and sync cable. I saw some reviews that say this doesn't work but it may be different sellers have somewhat different cables. The problem I have and why it gets a 3 from me is the cable works but has been acting a bit weird lately(random disconnects causing Windows to not recognize the device). But it's a knock-off so that's to be expected sometimes with cheapos. I will just order another. It's only a few cents plus shipping so you sometimes get what you pay for. If the 2nd cable works weirdly though I may just consider biting the bullet and paying Motorola for an OEM one. But if you need a 2nd cable and are not interested in paying $20+ to Motorola for around $3.00 what can you lose giving it a try?
0	Biggest piece of crap charger ive ever owned. Lasted about 5 days and charged very slowly. I highly recommend buying the samsung chargers fastest charging longest lasting one ive ever owned.
0	Has shortage and barely charges my phone I have a RAZR and it doesn't take to long to get charge..
2	but it stopped working after a while too bad it was handy to have around when driving and using a lot of battery
0	I purchased this for my droid and the product may as well have been hollow plastic. It doesn't charge my phone (or my girlfriend's phone).
2	So got the body glove case. Something that IS NOT spelled out. YOU MUST use the clip or else the stand isn't built in to the case itself. Here I thought the stand was built into the case it's not it's built INTO the clip. I don't want to use the clip. I think it's silly to have your phone outward so that anybody can knock into the screen. I want to use it in the case in a holster but that's not possible. This is a VERY silly design. I'm glad I only paid $14 for the case and not $39 something as I'd seen it in other places.VERY silly design.It's a hard case with a rubbery grippy non-stick kind of stuff over it. BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THIS STICKY STUFF IF you keep this case in your pocket with other stuff when you pull out the phone the other stuff sticks to the case and falls out of your pocket. Great way to lose credit cards wallet money...I'll use the case comes with a plug that lets you plug up the hole where the clip is but otherwise I wouldn't have bought it had I known how NOT great it was that you must use the clip.I'm adding that the seller finally refunded my money. They sent me a second case after the tabs that hold the back piece on broke off within a week of me using the case. The back piece is a real pain in the neck to get off. Then the second case they sent me the front piece's tabs broke off. When I contacted the seller they simply said we'll refund your money.It really isn't worthwhile if the case falls off your phone. It's supposed to protect the phone not break within a week of getting it.
0	I purchased two Body Glove phone protectors/covers for my husband's and my Sprint HTC Pro 2.  I primarily purchased this item based on the Body Glove reputation for good products...a little more expensive...I paid 14.99 for each cover at the time...since then price has been reduced. Our initial reaction was that it was a durable great fit and made nicely. Only problem is that after a short time of usage the casings would pop off...now I understand this has been a problem for many. Only wished I would have returned immediately - out $30.00.
0	I purchased this cover twice because I really liked it until it broke.  The cover fits the phone snug has a great feel and works great  UNTIL the tabs that hold the cover in place start to wear down with use then the cover just falls off the phone with no way to click it back on.  I liked the cover so much that I bought a second one and three months later it did it again.  If you are going to buy this cover I reccommend getting 4 for the year.
2	It's frustrating but there are not good cases for the HTC Pro II. I had the plastic holster type clip in carrying case and that broke. I purchased this one and hated it. First of all it makes an already bulky phone even bulkier. Second taking off the case (once on) is a real pain in the butt. Granted if you plan to put it on and leave it on I guess that's not a problem. The belt clip isn't tall enough to fit on the belt that I generally wear. And when on your belt the keyboard can drop down on its own.I never used the stand because I don't know why I'd really need my phone to stand up. Overall quite disappointed with this product.
2	My son ordered this and he was able to fix his phone without the high expense of someone else doing it.
2	It's the glass glue a handful of tools and that's it. That's all you need. Instructions (and really really good ones) can be found on YouTube. Better to watch a video than read a set of lazily written sentences on a sheet of paper.Take your time in a few spots - First taking the glass out. When I repaired a 3G I got impatient trying to remove the glass and pried under the bezel to get it out. That broke the back cover and made the bezel no longer fit. On this 3GS repair I used the suction cup and that was it. Worked perfectly. Remove the cables in order (not that I know doing it out of order would cause any harm). Take your time using a hair dryer (no need to purchase a heat gun but if you have one already it would help). This is going to be the most time consuming part getting the glue loose enough to come off. If you are impatient you will bend or break the plastic housing that holds the glass to the digitizer. Be sure the three connections are secure before you close the phone up and you shouldn't have any problems. If your camera speaker dock or home button (battery too) are acting up now is the time to take care of that as well. The less you play with the connections the better chance of them seating properly.This will take about an hour with a hair dryer with removing the glue taking by far the most amount of time. Heat gun will be much faster but be careful not to melt anything.4 stars just because I'm not sure about the long-term durability and quality of the replacement glass.EDIT: Two weeks later and the glue and home button failed. Home button cable completely tore off. Will be attempting a refund.
2	I love my cover it fits perfect and I have no problem what so ever I recommend this product to everyone
0	No wonder so cheap this is the wrong item This is not for a 3gs Iphone what a rip off The piece is bigger and it will not fit into the 3gsThis is not made for the 3gsDO NOT BUY from this companyNo GuideCheap toolsWrong item
0	This would be great if you're really good at separating the glued on plastic frame from the old broken glass digitizer.  That turns out to be A LOT of work!  I decided to get the pre-assembled unit instead after seeing how much work (time) was required using this cheaper product.
0	This product was horrible.  It did not come with the guide as promised forcing me to navigate through the many you tube videos for one that would work (if you do decide to buy this part make sure the video you are using is specifically for the 3GS as there are a few differences in where you will pry).  The screwdriver fit the external screws on the phone but was too large for the six internal screws used to hold the LCD to the glass.  The screwdriver size needed is a Phillips 1.6mm screwdriver (which will work for all screws on the phone) I was given a size 2.0mm (you can find the correct screwdriver at radio shack if you still decide to buy this part).  Also the pre-cut adhesive provided was not properly trimmed and was bigger than the area into which it was supposed to fit.  The worst thing about this set is that the case opener tools provided are too wide to fit into the cracks they are supposed to making prying the screen assembly out a daunting task (I ended up using a very small non-magnetic flat-head screwdriver which worked very well). The case opener tools are also made of such malleable plastic that pieces of them broke off in the phone and my LCD was badly damaged causing my entire phone to be useless. (whatever you do do not use the prying method of removing the LCD from the glass there is an alternate method involving wedging a kitchen knife between two pieces of metal (videos can be found on you tube) that is much more safe for your LCD particularly since the tools provided with this kit are likely to break and cause further damage to your phone.  This repair is not difficult if you have the right tools and your screen is not too badly cracked at the top and bottom frame.  If is is badly cracked in those places you have to heat the frame several times over and peel each individual shard of glass from the adhesive before you can begin to apply the new glass.  I would recommend a full assembly product that includes new LCD screen glass digitizer assemble already connected to the frame home button and earpiece.  This will cost you about $60 but will only take you about 3 minutes to complete (even if you are not tech savvy) and will only require you to remove and replace two screws and three small cables instead of a process which involves removing 6 screws 3 cables carefully prying your LCD off without damaging it melting adhesive in order to do some more prying and getting glass shard all over the house removing difficult excess adhesive reapplying new adhesive without allowing air bubbles replacing the glass properly then reversing the whole process. And upon rubbing my hand across my sofa I have just discovered that I have a small splinter of glass stuck in my finger!
2	Save your money by purchasing another lcd from someone else read all reviews.  You'll spend about 15 bucks but worth the difference.  Toolkit was included and instructions can be found at IFIXIT.
0	THIS ITEM WASNT EVEN USED- FIRST OF ALL I TOOK EVERYTHING OUT THE PACKAGE AND IT DIDNT HAVE ANY OF THE TOOLS- SO I HAD TO PERSONALLY FIND THE ITEMS I CAN USE AROUND MY HOME SECONDLY THE GLASS ITSELF WASNT THE CORRECT SIZE I PUT IT ON THE IPHONE AND IT WOULD FALL OFF. THIS ITEM IS TRASH
2	So I got this and had all the confidence in the world I could fix my cracked glass in a snap. Turned out the little screwdriver was horrible and ended up stripping my screws trying to get the display and the glass separated. Ended up having to buy a new display and another new glass because the screwdriver from this stripped the screws so badly it was impossible to get them out.
2	typically my porcuts from this vendor are good but this one had a very poor seal between the digitizer and the glass leaving an oily swirl look when its off.. it functions just fine just irritating as heck
0	Go pay a professional to fix your phone less of a hassle! Still have the product in my room collecting dust.
2	Everything included is what you need EXCEPT for the heat gun... they do not mention. This kit will NOT remove an important part you need removed. I had to put my old broken screen/phone back together once I realized this kit did not have everything I needed. :(
2	I was able to get an iPhone 3GS to work by replacing the broken screen with this screen after following You Tube instructions.  This is a bit tough for the novice and takes patience to get it right.  I recommend purchasing a more complete glass connectors etc.
2	This product will perform it's described function which is to protect your ipone3. Just remember that it is not for new iphone4 and is not compatible with it.
2	As a user of an InCase slim model for the past year I was in the market for a new case for my iPhone. This case seemed to have all that I was looking for. The shock resistance is a plus and the color is pretty snazzy but the main problem I have with this phone is that the ridge surrounding the main button at the bottom of the iPhone's face is extremely annoying. It makes it a pain to push the button and is something I could just not get used to. If you don't mind having a ridge surrounding the main button then go for this case. But if you can see that being potentially annoying for you find a different one.
2	while yes this little case will hold your phone nicely and does look rather slick and so on it's still lacking a major aspect that all BlackBerry cases should have.I doesn't have a magnet in it that will actually turn off the key pad of the black berry phones.So no matter what you do your phone will get buttons pushed and when you take it out to start talking you'll have a message saying would you like to assign this hot key... The only way around this it to lock your phones keypad before you put it in the holder. This kind of defeats the purpose of having the case then. There are several other just as cheap cases available that do this very thing.I don't see how Amazon could have left out such a key feature in the process of making these cases.While it does have a magnet clasp on the case to hold it closed it's not positioned right to turn off the keypad at the same time. Clearly whoever designed this case knows nothing about BlackBerry products and how they work in general.such a simple thing to implement and they didn't even do that... So very disappointing.
2	The clip itself beats some other cases sold for the BlackBerry Curve. The most important part of such a unit might be the clip.  That's the part that clips to a belt or other anchor and simultaneously attached to the case and swivels horizontal or vertical. However there is no magnet in the case to turn the Blackberry off - major problem.  A separate minor issue is that the magnate in the clasp is not as strong as what I'm used to in other cases.Pros:*Clip - the part that attaches to belt and also the case and swivels as described above.*Case itself - it's tight and secures the Curve well.*Logo - I prefer the AmazonBasics brand logo over other brand logos because Amazon is known for customer service.Cons:*No auto-shut off because no magnet in case to do that.*The magnate in the clasp is not strong.*The Blackberry Curve phone loads vertically into this holster not horizontally. That makes it just a tiny bit more effort to unholster when answering a call.
2	This is a nice quality leather case but the magnetic holder isn't strong enough and comes open at times.  The sides don't hold the phone in well either so it ends up on the floor if I lay down and play with my son for a bit.  I prefer Velcro or snap tops on the case.  The second issue is the case will rotate parallel to the ground but then I would be really worried about losing my phone.The material had no funny smells like a cheap case I bought off of an online auction site and the snap is nice and firm and doesn't rotate too easily by itself.  For material quality I would give this a 4 or 5 but for my phone it doesn't work great.  Put a stronger magnet in it and slightly taller sides so the phone doesn't fall out and it would be a winner.
2	I was initially delighted when this case arrived! The leather is of excellent quality and is butter-soft. The stitching is perfect and gives it a stylish appearance. It has a magnetic closure which works smoothly. The design is well-thought out with the side gussets low on either side to allow for easy holstering and retrieval of your phone. The interior is lined with a soft napped fabric to avoid scratches to the phone. The belt clip is sturdy neatly attached and swivels smoothly.This case would be perfect except for one key feature that was left off - a magnetic proximity sensor which automatically turns the back light off and locks the touch screen when holstering and back on when retrieving your phone! This is an extremely important feature to most Blackberry users as it conserves battery life and eliminates butt dialing. I am confused at why Amazon took the time to design such a nice case specifically cut for a Blackberry Curve and failed to add this. Would have been 5 stars had it not been for this.
2	There's nothing really wrong with these protectors. They go on in the typically difficult way these things go on and they protect about as well as the last protector I had. Their texture seems a little rubbery to me compared to other smoother covers I've had in the past but that might just be a taste thing -- it doesn't affect usability at all.All in all if you need cheap screen protection you could do worse than these.
2	I previously had a different brand of screen protector on my phone but eventually removed it.  Although it applied cleanly at first overtime I noticed it became pretty gross as it collected makeup resdue and dust around the edges of the protector (i.e. where the button is and along the perimeter of the phone).However after the screen of my phone cracked I was willing to give screen protectors another try to hopefully protect my screen and give it a smoother surface to touch.Compared to the first product I tried these were much easier to apply.  It seems like they have really designed this with the intent of making it easy so you don't get bubbles the first time.  That said when you get 5 it's more reassuring that you have more if you screw up.That said these still suffer from the same problems as screen protectors overall.  If you're using your phone a lot they can pick up particles along the edges of the sticker.  Because of that I've just come to expect I will have to change the stickers out once a month.
2	I've used several iPhone screen protectors on my iPhone 3G and my wife's iPhone 3G S and this iteration is OK not the best I've seen just OK. I look for three quality's in a screen protector: ease of installation scratch resistance and staying power. It's even somewhat contentious if the 3G S even needs a screen protector as Apple would prefer you use the oleophobic screen bare; something which I would not recommend. As an aside I am currently carrying an iPhone 4 which I will use without a screen protector and rely on the Gorilla Glass to stave off scratches.Installation was typical for this category the sheet is a bit stiffer than is typical which makes it impossible to crinkle when laying it down but the squeegy card was not stiff enough making it hard to press down enough to completely get bubbles out.As for scratch resistance I'm disappointed in this protector. It's been only a week and already I'm seeing visible scuffs in the surface. This might be bad luck but I tend to think it just isn't durable enough.As for staying power that seems to be fine. Often with these products it's too easy for an edge to come loose and accumulate an ugly layer of dust. No indication of that happening here.In summary OK but I recommend theKrypton Screen Armor 2-Pack for iPhone 3G and 3GSinstead I've had good results with it.
2	It protects the screen yes. But it seems to attract dust and dirt and must be cleaned often and the material the protector is made of gets scratched really easily. I guesss thats why it comes in packs of 5
2	I have the iphone and ordered these protector films wanting to protect the phone from the hard use I put it through.  I have to say that these do work but for a few problems.  First it is really hard to get all the air bubbles out without ruining the stick on the film.  Secondly the clarity of the film after it was on the phone made it look like I was looking through a fish tank.  Not bad but a little grainy.  Lastly once a corner gets turned up even a little it gets caught on everything and I have yet to find a way to cut the corner off without either scratching the phone or peeling the entire film off.
2	It's possible I got a bad package of these screen protectors but I went through all of them in one evening because even through I used the provided cloth and eventually another cloth meant for a camera lens there were specks of dust (not visible by two different people on the iPhone) that almost seemed to be on the film from manufacturing. Of course there was no way to fix that.bI did like that you got 5 films instead of the normal 1-3 and it came with a little hard piece of cardboard to smooth out bubbles in addition to the cleaning cloth. There just seemed to be something wrong with these that they came preloaded with tiny flaws.Assuming one got a good package they were easy to install and fit my 3GS perfectly.
2	With this product you get quantity not quality.These screen protectors are thin and prone to scratching.  Mine got scratched from just wiping it with a soft cloth after applying it.Also these have a 'rainbow' look to it when the iPhone's display is off.  When it's on you don't notice it as much.One other thing to note is that these will not work with the 'slider' type cases such as the Incase Slider as the screen protector and the edge of the case overlap causing it to bubble up.  This may be a design flaw of the slider cases but it's worth noting.
2	If you have an iphone and don't use this screen protector your crazy.  Here's the thing you MUST take your time to get these on the right way.  If you rush through the way I did you will waste at least 2 of them....hey maybe that's why they sell it in a 5 pack.  If you take your time and apply it correctly they are awesome...a must have.
0	First let me say I'm a big fan of a number of AmazonBasic products including the anti-glare iPhone 3G Screen Protectors - this is the first time I've had a bad experience with any of the brand's products.These protectors have a defect - the 2nd tab doesn't remove the adhesive has aged and will no longer peel off.  To remove I tried several efforts: regular peeling off soaking chemicals microfiber cloth and scratching(hey I had a pack of 5 to try...) -- all of them produced the same result -- a scratched corner (or worse across the screen) and added several bubbles underneath as you tried to pull it off.what a disaster!  I've haven't checked into warranty remedies at this point - but really at this price you just toss.
2	This is a fairly decent screen protector.  Once applied it does a great job of protecting my iphone screen from scuffs and scratches.  The clarity is awesome.  I had no trouble using my iphone with the screen protector.  I rated it down a little because of the card that is included for smoothing out the bubbles.  It is cardboard and simply is not strong or rigid enough.  I didn't feel like I could put any real pressure on it which made the application a little more difficult.  Other screen protector kits I have tried included included heavier pieces that could take a lot of abuse.  The one in the Amazon kit feels like it won't last through multiple applications.
2	I understant the concept. Don't get fingerprints on the screen. But touching these things isn't better. So why bother?
2	I didn't experience any installation issues with this and in fact the stiffness of the plastic makes it easier to apply without bubbles than the softer floppy kind.  The thicker kind like this flatten down better and squeeze the air out as they are applied.  I didn't need to use the squeegee.  Note that even the tiniest spec of dust will cause irreversible bubbles no matter how careful you are so be sure to clean the display and apply the protector in a very clean and breeze-free area.On to the anti-glare function...First it does work if you really need it.  However it kind of makes the display look just a tad weird and foggy.  This is not the magical anti-glare coating which is available for optics and TV screens (which eliminate glare with virtually no loss of clarity or transparency) although I don't know if that can be applied to a flexible plastic layer so maybe that isn't a fair expectation.  But the bottom line is this is a compromise which is useful if you need it but I personally would go for a screen protector without this feature.  I would rather have to occasionally angle the phone to avoid a glare than to give up full brightness and clarity.
0	I'm afraid I can't tell you how well this screen protector works because I found it impossible to install. The backside of the protector (the side that adheres to the iPhone screen) is too sticky meaning you can't align it to the screen just right. There are multiple bubbles under the surface and the little squeegee provided isn't effective enough in removing all of the bubbles. It looks like one of those cheap window-tinting jobs. On top of that one of the two tab labels that are supposed to be removed wouldn't come off completely. Of course you are instructed not to touch the screen protector with your fingers so if the label can't be removed you're out of luck. I'm sure that *if* you can install this screen protector properly it would work just fine but it definitely wasn't worth the aggravation. Speaking as someone who has had an iPhone screen protector before I know that there are better products out there that install easily and work well. I recommend passing on this one.
2	I've used several screen protectors over the last two years between all my husband & I's iPhones. I thought these came with the best instructions of them all. Very easy to use tabs and stickers directing you how to apply. I am not the greatest at doing things like this and often have to refer to my husband for help. I did apply this screen protector all by myself and for the most part absent of air bubbles. It does it's job protecting your screen from being scratched or broken. I have used it for a few weeks without any damage to my screen while often dropping and improperly handling my phone ha ha. So for inexpensive easy to use protectors these are great. The clarity is great. My only complaint is that they seem to not be as sticky as others I've used in the past. If you have a case on it probably won't matter too much but otherwise you might notice corners peeling up just a tiny bit. Although it is the summer and it's hot and again I don't use my phone very carefully. Hope that helps. I'll probably buy them again to save money you get three for a fraction of the cost of the single ones at the Apple store.
2	Screen Protectors generally fall in 2 categories: the sticky type and the static cling type. This is the sticky type.  Screen Protectors generally come in 2 finishes: shiny (glare) and reduced glare as well as smooth vs soft.  This Screen Protector is softer and has reduced glare.3 (1 to screw-up 1 for you and 1 for your Significant Other) Amazon-branded screen protectors come in an easy to open cardboard envelope along with a screen cleaning cloth and a stiff piece of plastic to squeegee the air bubbles out during application.  Instructions are simple and easy to understand.  Recommended.
2	I've tried a few different types of screen protectors on my iPhone 3G. This particular model is a hard-plastic kind that is supposed to reduce glare. I haven't really noticed any difference though -- the screen is still hard to read in direct light. This film makes it a little better I suppose but not enough to make it a significant selling point. (I should note that I haven't yet tested it in direct sunlight since I seldom use my phone under those conditions.)The film was easy enough to put on. It takes a little practice to figure out how to get any screen film onto the phone but a few tries are usually enough for you to get the hang of it. The package comes with a squeegee to smooth down the film but it was too small and flimsy. Just use a credit card instead to smooth out all the air bubbles.This film is pretty thick made of hard plastic so it offers good protection to the phone's screen but doesn't sacrifice the touch-screen capability. What it does do however if cloud the screen slightly giving it a filmy appearance. Thus the image isn't as clean or crisp as it is without the protector or with some different kinds of protectors. This isn't a huge problem -- but an ideal cover would provide no problem at all.
2	Given that my iPhone has some scratches and I have never owned a screen protector I decided to pick up this product.  I must say that the results are somewhere between usefully good and a little disappointing.GOOD1) The directions are very simple.--A) Clean screen with microfiber cloth--B) Remove Tab A bottom side of screen protector--C) Apply adhesive side down on iPhone--D) Squeegee out the bubbles--E) Remove Tab B top side of screen protector2) The feel and touch of the screen is somehow better than before.  No longer is there a moist finger on a glass screen causing slow-down.  It feels sleeker.3) There are three screens in the packaging just in case the third step is misaligned or the product is warped.4) The glare is minimized greatly.5) I'm confident it will protect against scratches.BAD1) It still doesn't get rid of the bubbles that plague so many other iPhone screens protectors.2) The squeegee device is a piece of plastic that doesn't remove the bubbles causing the screen to look like a cheap tint-job from a less than reputable auto detailer.3) The actual application of the adhesive to the screen is a one-shot effort.  Do it right you're happy.  Apply incorrectly and you'll want to tear it off and try again.  There is a reason there are three available because just like lamination the first effort is rarely perfect.UGLYThe packaging was wasteful and ineffective.  First the product is the width and length of an iPhone but approximately 1/20th the depth.  So why did it come in a box that could have held a set of encyclopedias?  Second the frustration free packaging is anything but that and the easy strip removal didn't work.  I had to open it like a sealed envelop.Overall it's the Benecio Del Toro of iPhone screen protectors: it will probably work fairly well but it won't ever excite or impress.Jason Elin
2	The AmazonBasics Anti-Glare Screen Protector Film pack for the iPhone is like most thin screen protectors for mobile electronics: The concept in good but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.The biggest issue with these screen protectors (like most screen protectors) boils down to one problem: Any contamination between the screen and the thin screen protection film causes air bubbles which interfere with the iPhone's touchscreen or simply make the screen look bad when you look at it.Yes Amazon gives you screen cleaning wipes and a microfiber cloth for cleaning the screen before you apply the protective film but unless you're working in a laboratory clean room chances are that a small bit of dust or particle of dirt will get caught between the screen and the film ... creating tiny air pockets and trapping the dirt between the screen and the film so you can't wipe it away.Also since the film is basically just a giant transparent sticker if you happen to touch the sticky side when applying the film then your skin oils (and possibly and tiny particles of dirt on your fingertips) will be stuck on the film and get trapped between the screen and the film just like I mentioned before.On the bright side Amazon is giving you a three pack here so you can try again if you get a bunch of dirt on your screen and the protector film looks horrible.The only type of screen protectors that I've used that don't have problems like this are the ones that are pretty thick (which also tend to impact the performance of the iPhone touchscreen.Bottom line these things work but you need to be aware of the real-world problems that come with using protective films like this.
0	I've owned some great films for phones but had a horrible time with this film and rendered unusable. Had to throw them away.
2	I got a set of the anti-glare and the regular screen savers for my Iphone 3gs.  This was my first anti-glare protector and I do like the way it reduces glare however like all anti-glare it kills the brightness and crispness of the screen.  For that reason I prefer the regular protector.As far as other protectors it seems to be as good as others I've used from the AT&T; store as well as others I've bought from Amazon.  No matter how hard I try I always get bubbles in my screen after a while and these are no exception.  I'll probably stick to the amazon brand but will get the regular protectors from now on.
2	I always keep my iPhone screen protected. I am an avid user of the Zagg line of shield protectors. Zagg is probably known as one of the top screen protectors on the market. The Zagg surface is VERY RESISTANT to scratching. They demonstrate its resistance with a car key trying to scratch it. I performed my own informal key scratch test to compare the Zagg to the AmazonBasics protector. It reveals that the AmazonBasics model is not nearly as scratch resistant as the Zagg.Installation is very tricky here unlike the Zagg. This shield uses adhesive only. You must follow the instructions strictly and you must try to keep you fingers off the adhesive side to prevent permanent marks under the shield. The Zagg invisible shield concept uses a liquid spray (probably just distilled water) to apply to your fingers and to BOTH sides of the shield when installing which not only makes the installation easy because you can make minor movements to line it up it also prevents fingerprints. The AmazonBasics shield does not use liquid solution for the install.If you have tight latex gloves available this will eliminate danger of fingerprints. VERY carefully pull tab 1 to peel back the screen protector but pull only part way. Take the time to line it up perfectly before you continuing to peel it back while pushing out air bubble. It can be done nicely if you are careful.
2	Once this was put on my iPhone the iPhone display looked different.  I could sort of see small (tiny) dots throughout the cover. I'm going to presume that this is the inherent design of the cover and that the way it is supposed to reduce glare is by diffusing or re-directing incident light via these dots.  I don't care for it personally but others who have seen it don't seem to mind it a bit.I haven't noticed any change in ability to select items via the touch screen interface of the iPhone so that's good.Outdoors when glare is the worst there is still some glare coming off this cover. It's no miracle worker but it does help some.
2	This was super easy to put on and had very little trouble keeping bubbles out.  The anti-glare gives your screen a slightly grainy appearance that may or may not be distracting especially since the iPhone screens are so clear.  Don't rule it out there are lots of protectors out there and I have yet to find one that really is a star performer.
2	I'm giving this case three stars because its not actually made of leather despite the name including the word leather.  Its made of very nice fake leather aka vinyl non-animal origin.  Not being a vegan I would rather have had actual leather . . .  However the craftsmanship is excellent the price is great so I'll use the case.It fits my bare Droid snugly.  The belt clip is very sturdy (belt loops seem pretty flimsy).  The magnetic closure is quite positive.If it were actually made of leather I would have given the case five stars.
0	Picture is a lie this is garbage.  The leather is the thickness of a hefty trash bag it is pvc not leather.  ripped on 2nd day.  Good reason to not order this the pic is not what I was sent.  Quality is terrible and fit is like OJ's glove. will cost you more to send it back -- AVOID this and the seller -- they LIE
0	Wrong case.  Doesn't fit my Droid.  Had it fit I wouldn't have returned the item but it didn't fit so therefore I did have to return it.  Sorry for all this gobbledgook but I have to meet the 20 word minimum... ;)  I mean really what else can I say about this??
2	This skin applies like the other brands - you must have steady hands and plenty of patience.  Unfortunately mine was just a tiny bit too large for the Motorola Droid screen so it does not adhere well to one of the edges.  Its really just a cosmetic issue as it has stayed put for about three weeks now (under a Seidio Innocase).  I also understand that there can be some variation in the phone dimensions themselves - which makes me think maybe the skin should be ever so slightly smaller to allow a miniscule uncovered edge.
2	Very crystal clear screen. There is no way to install this without getting one or two spec's of dust stuck under the protector. Make sure you read everyone's review on how to install this.This screen has many micro bubbles stuck under it and is not scratch proof. Do not use the applicator card that comes with it. It will permanently scratch your skinomi as it did to mine. I have had this screen protector on for 2 weeks and all these imperfections have not disappeared like everyone else claims. All in all when I turn on my Droid you can not see these imperfections.The life time replacements are a scam you have to pay 6-7 dollars to ship one to you so you might as well buy it again and get a new spray bottle.**Edit** I wanted to comment that customer service is actually great and they take care of customers that are not completely satisfied. Skinomi responds to emails quickly and customer satisfaction is their goal.
0	This screen protector is thick and sticky.  To install it you're supposed to be ultra-clean make it wet (great idea: electronics and water) and squeeze the bubbles out but  the result didn't look good.  Since it's so expensive that you only get a single protector you can't try again.  I just pulled it off and threw the whole wet sticky mess into the trash.The protector is so thick and slick that I don't think it would have been good even if if it were installed perfectly.  I've used other screen protectors on other phones and they were easier to install and gave much better results.
2	Very cheaply made. The cable very brittle. The covering of the cable cracks when flexed. Eventually just didn't make connection and stopped charging devices. After the course of a week we went through 2 of the 3 chargers we ordered. Shame on me what else should be expected from $3 phone chargers.
2	Great for a backup or second charger but it doesn't charge very fast and is not as long as it looks
2	I would use this as my priamary charger since my USB cable was so short. They lasted about a year. My needs have now changed so I don't use this anymore but I would consider buying it again for my office once the one I have there dies.
2	I originally ordered 8 of these for our 3 Droid X phones.  1 of them did not work.  I contacted The OEM Shop and they said they'd send a replacement ASAP.  Got it in 5 days.  This time they sent sent two.  One of these didn't work so I left a 3 star review.They contacted me immediately asking me to remove the feedback and in return would send me a complimentary bluetooth headset.  I said sure.  Got the headset in 5 days and it didn't work!Wow!  sent 11 items and 3 were duds?  That's  a 27% product failure rate.Pros:-Longer cord than original Droid X charger from Motorola-InexpensiveCons:-NOT real Motorola chargers.  Surely these would be circuit-tested before leaving the factory if they were authentic?-Cheaply made.  Cord is very thin.-Does NOT have the USB cord.  Only for 110 AC chargingOverall if you're getting these for $3.25 including shipping you're getting a good deal.  Having to buy 25% more than you need to make up for failures is not a good business model in my opinion.
2	Works great with the iphone 5 but not compatible with the 5s. Great quality for price just the one issue with the 5s.
2	The Griffin PowerJolt SE Coiled Lightning Car Charger for iPhone 5 seems to work OK charging an iPhone 5 - but the Lightning plug end is *much* larger than on the standard Apple Lightning cable or on several Belkin Lightning cables that I bought recently.It will not fit through the port hole on either of my iPhone 5 cases (Belkin Grip Candy Sheer Case/Cover For New Apple iPhone 5andSpeck Products CandyShell Glossy Case for iPhone 5); it does work on my wife'sOtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5.Griffin Tech please go back to the drawing board and come back with a Lightning plug that fits the majority of cases out there.  This one does not.
2	I am on my third one.  One broke when being stretched to the back seat and one broke after only a few uses and being put in the upholder right next to the plug.  I got lucky that it happened within the return period.  If the third one breaks too I will search for another brand but the first one did so well for so long that I felt they deserved another chance.
0	Had it for a couple weeks before it stopped working under normal wear. I like the low profile design but cannot recommend based on quality.
2	The cord is not coming out of the lightning side. Its falling apart. Be careful with this product if you're going to be using it in a normal fashion.
0	Original review below.  After a year this charger went belly-up.  Although the connection to the lighter still lit up and it looked like it was active it did not charge my phone.  Was disappointed but thought it lasted a year and I'd have to just get another.  On the first use of the new PowerJolt I noticed intermittent phone charging.  When I unplugged the cable the connector separated from the cable and remained in the phone.  I've had several Griffin products over the years and have always been satisfied with the quality.  Something has changed in their quality control.  Sending it back to Amazon and will avoid Griffin products in the future.========================================Bought a Griffin for my iphone-4 and when I upgraded to a 5 I bought this charger.  I've had it for about 3 months now and it works without issue.  Much better quality than other brands I've used.  Would buy again without hesitation.
2	Belt straps broke after about 2 weeks of usage. Other than that the pouch is good..it's still in good shape today...I use it occasionally..
2	I originally thought that this case was like the one I already had where the front and back snap together but it's just the back cover. After putting it on and having it for a while now I love this case. It's not rubbery so it doesn't get caught up on things it's smooth and the colors are so beautiful. I don't drop my phone often - if I did I don't think this case would provide much protection but as an accessory it's perfect.January 21 2012 - I am editing my review because for the past few weeks I've realized that my case design is peeling off! I got it around the 1st of November and been using it since then. It lasted 2 months. Chunks of the design peel off every day. I'm so sad. It was such a beautiful case. I carry my phone in my pocket or my purse and not that often because I'm a stay at home mom and I tend to leave it on the desk 5 days out of the week. It shouldn't be peeling so badly.
2	This is such a cute case and fits well to my 3G but it is not very protective.  It is only a cover for the back and it does not wrap around to the front.  Worth what I paid and will be good for a night out but not for everyday use.
2	Cute case for iphone. Nice design but the case is not as colorful as pictured and is not shiny at all. Good value for the price but it's not my favorite cover. .
2	This phone case is really pretty but it doesn't stay that way for long.. It's also very soft. But like I said it doesn't stay that way and gets dirty really quickly.
0	This item came broken. I dont think it was the sellers fault.  Most likly the shipers fault.  Wasnt worth the money to send back to get new one.  Daughter was very disappointed.
2	cracked as soon as it was put on very flimsy.
2	Cheap gray plastic. Color the picture faded do not meet the same that in the picture. It looks disgusting and primitive
0	The battery I received did not fit for the HTC My touch 3G. I'm an international customer so it's too expensive to return the battery.
2	I received the battery on time and everything. That was great! It was in new condition looked unused - that's good too. However using this just seemed like that original battery. It died just as fast. I wasn't completely happy with that. But I will keep it just as a backup; since I know this phone is pretty bad with battery use.Overall if you get this battery just use it as a backup - not the primary. It's the exact same as the original.
2	This cord doesn't charge at a fast rate and isn't durable either so pretty much I just use it for and overnight charge..
0	This cable keeps my HTC Incredible charged for two seconds then uncharged for two seconds and repeats the whole time plugged in to my laptop.  I do not recommend AT ALL for HTC Incredible smart phones.
2	Never could get the product to fit just right. The tip was made a little to thin and wouldn't sit right in the charging port. Shop elsewhere.
2	I have had this phone for only two months and I am now unable to use it. I know now that I should have made myself aware of the possible problemsI could experience. The phone does not turn on any longer. In fact I cannot even get into the home page. Apparently others have experience the same problem. Only recently has this model has been sold in the USA and at such a very high price one should expect more than a two month usage period before breakdown. It is a very attractive phone. If only it worked properly. I would love to get my money back and go for something that's tried and true.
2	I have a Nokia C6-00 been using it for a year. I bought the Nokia N97 Mini to compare it to my C6-00. Dimensions (length x width) they are comparable and weight-wise comparable. The C6-00 is a newer model and has a D-pad with arrows to move around with a 4-row keyboard. The N97 mini only has three rows. The N97 mini keyboard is more generously spaced out though versus C6-00. You can't really go wrong with either as they use the same Symbian system might as well go with a newer model the C6-00. Nokia is a dying breed though Symbian is not used anymore either with their flagship product. My next phone will be Android-based or Apple OS.
0	I searched for accessories for my new Droid X.  This docking station came up with other accessories for the X.  And in now re-reviewing the description it still is not clear that this will not fit the X but it absolutely won't!  The USB male does not match up with the X nor is it long enough for it.  Hopefully they will come out with a docking station that will fit the Motorola Droid X but THIS AIN'T IT!  I guess before the Motorola Droid X came out recently there was only one Motorola Droid so this description needs to be updated now that there are 2 M Droids (and reports of a Motorola Droid 2 soon to be released!)
2	There are two versions of this product. One has a slot to charge a spare battery the other does not. This one does not. I bought one of each. While both work well the one that charges the spare battery is most useful. Prices were similar.
2	This docking station works as advertised. My wife likes it as her phone does not have a case. However it does not accept my encased phone which is irritating. The cable detaches for use without docking so the purchase works for both of us.
2	I tend to charge my Droid every evening so this dock sitting on my night stand makes this pretty convenient. The dock works well and is attractive. In reality though all it does is provide power to the Droid along with a vertical tilt. Cool and all but the price seems a bit steep for what is really just a cool convenient charger.Overall I'm happy with the device but they really should have included a longer cord. I have a power source directly below my nightstand where the dock is located. It's just an average sized night stand yet and could not be closer to the power source. However the dock has to sit a bit sideways on my night stand because at the correct angle the cord won't reach. It's that short. Think about it... 3 feet. How high is your night stand? You can replace with just a longer usb cable and their AC to USB adapter that comes with it but for that price you really shouldn't have to. Currently I consider it to be the absolute minimum length to work in optimum conditions. I'd have to guess for most people the cord length won't work at all.
2	I bought this item because I thought it would let me hookup to tv or audio system to play movies or music.  This base is a glorified USB cable.  It does offer the feel of an alarm clock music player but you could do that by leaning it up on its side while plugged in.  I think it's way overpriced for what you get.  I paid $20 US for it and basically got another charging cord (something else to have to keep track of).  If this unit had audio/video outputs it would be worth it.  I don't recommend this item unless you can buy it for 10 or $15.
0	I mistakenly bought this thinking it was made by Motorola for Droids in general. Mine is HTC. Stupid! It is supposedly only meant for Droids made by Motorola. EXCEPT - we can't give it away. It does not fit any of our friends' Motorola Droids either. Cost more to return than it is worth so . . .
2	If you have a desire to use your Motorola Droid as a bedside alarm clock then yes this dock is definitely for you. Because that is pretty much all it does (except it also charges the onboard battery).The dock triggers the phone to enter dock mode but the dock mode can be triggered by a free program from the AppMarket called DockRunner (Droid) no dock needed.And really the dock mode as shown in the picture turns your phone into a bedside alarm clock. You can set alarm trigger night mode (softer contrast) and even get a preview of the weather among a few other minor passive functions. You *could* make it also play music in the background (yes the built-in MUSIC app has a jukebox mode) so I guess it's more of a clock-radio with alarm.If I really want a clock radio with alarm I would buy one in my local Walgreens (or whatever) for $10 not pay $20-$30 for a fancy piece of shaped plastic with a charger tip.As many others have pointed out the dock is designed for an UNPROTECTED NAKED PHONE. It is not compatible with cases. If you have a case slipped on you cannot put it in the dock.While technically if you don't want the BOTTOM half protected then you can remove *THAT* and put the phone in the dock with the keyboard exposed but that rather defeats the aesthetics of the dock. Doesn't it?There is ONE good thing about the dock though... The AC adapter you get with it can be used WITHOUT the dock. Yes you can plug that tip straight to the phone skipping the dock altogether. Since a spare AC adapter cost the same as the dock on the Verizon website you may as well get the dock.If you already have alarm clocks and such then this accessory is superfluous except it looks cool. But then looking cool is not always a good reason to spend money.
2	We bought this as an alternative to an alarm clock.  It ended up being too bright so my wife brought it to work.  She uses it to charge her phone while listening to Pandora which works great.A lot of the app options didn't work like they were suppose to.  We didn't trouble-shoot it much because the options my wife wanted work (clock weather and Pandora).  I am disappointed that the screen never turned off.  Even when the brightness level was set as low as it could go there was always a little light coming off of it.
2	When i got this docking station i was ecxited about it. So i docked my phone and it has its own screen while on the docking station. What i did not like about is that if you protect your phone with a cover this docking station is totally useless so i had to get rid of since i dont work in an office.
2	The giftee didn't tell me until recently that it didn't charge the phone. She thought it was just to set it in.. o well...Just tossed it in the trash...
2	The case is very good as it protects the whole phone but the thing you should watch for is the back part of the case that snaps to the back of the phone. Mine broke and my phone fell out on the concrete. Now my phone has a crack on the screen because the bottom part of the case broke.
2	The case works well.  The rubberized feel gives the phone some feeling of extra stability.  The removable belt clip and belt clip circular piece from the back of the case is a nice feature.  It even comes with a hole plug if you decide to take the clip off.  Phone slides very easily with case on.  The kick stand on the belt clip is a cool feature so you can have the phone standing on your desk while you charge it.  Couple this with a Skinomi screen protector to give your Droid the best protection.UPDATEAfter using for several months I no longer would recommend this product.  The piece that covers the back has become loose and it no longer holds the phone in the case appropriately.
2	I bought this Body Glove case with my droid and used it for a couple of weeks before returning it and buying the Verizon OEM case and holster.Motorola A855 Droid Verizon Original OEM Belt Clip Shell / Holster(Note there are about four different entries on Amazon for what appear to be the same item.)  The reasons I returned it are largely covered in some of the other comments here. On the belt clip the display is facing out and subject to being scraped on things. It also is held out away from my body so that it snags on things.  The display is free to slide open making it even more subject to being torn off.After about a week the display portion of the case started coming off way too easily. This is just a small strip that fits around the display and really doesn't seem to add much to the protection. Apparently the clip that holds it in place wore down and it would pop off when I opened the display to get to the keyboard.Also as mentioned elsewhere the case over the back of the phone was extremely difficult to remove and really did feel like it could pull the phone apart. I don't have a dock for the phone so this was not a big issue since all the ports and buttons are accessible.On the good side this is a nice heavy case with a bit of a tacky feel making it much easier to hold the phone. the button for the belt clip can be replaced by a plug that is flush on the back of the phone but this requires getting the case off the phone (see above complaint).Overall this is a nice case but I really can't recommend it especially after I have used the Verizon case that I have now.
0	The original Droid and Droid 2 design does not lend itself to a friendly cover design; the top-sliding screen that reveals the physical keyboard is the issue. The Body Glove case does not fit this part of the phone well at all and that is where I find most of my issue with this protective cover.The top part of this case does not fit the screen area well and the left side of the case is thin and flexible and does not protect the phone at all. Because I live in Florida sand is everywhere even though the phone has never touched sand directly. Sand and dust easily got under the top part of the case. Because of the loose fit on the left side of the screen sand and grit eventually got ground in to the phone case leaving specs of exposed metal where black shiny paint had once been. I am ridiculously protective of my phone keeping it in an empty pocket so the first time I removed the top portion of the case I was really upset to find my phone had actually been physically damaged.Eventually the top part of the case broke. The loose edge snapped after a few months so I removed that part of the case and kept the lower portion on. A few months later the rubber material began to peel off. I finally just threw it out.This product is not worth the money or the damage to your phone. It wears quickly and has a poor design.
0	Fell apart with in a couple of weeks. The snaps on the front part broke with in the first couple of days I kept the back so I could clip it onto my belt but all the rubber wore off and it just isnt well made.
2	I figured at the asking price this item would out do all the other protection screens it worked pretty good for about a week then I started to notice the screen having finger marks right there where I was pressing on it the most. I text quite a bit therefore the screen had little press marks on them (especially on the letters that I use the most). this is only after a week then I began to notice scratches on it this item is very easy to scratch. I was very happy with the way it looked at the beginning unfortunately it begins to look bad after a very short time.if this could be made of better plastic so that it would resist scratches and not show finger smudged it would be a good product
0	Maybe I'm a klutz but there's a small blue tab on this screen that's supposed to be peeled away for the final application of these screens. It DOES NOT PULL AWAY without lifting off and/or fatally creasing the screen as well. The blue tab is completely pointless and since I ordered two of these just in case the blue tab ruined BOTH of them. Looks good in the description but cannot believe more people haven't complained about this. If there had been a ZERO stars option I'd have chosen that.  Too expensive for this kind of instant loss; buy yourself a milkshake instead.
0	The seller got my email address and spammed me.It says I have to watch a movie to install this.I've installed dozens of screen protectors and didn't have to watch a movie to install any of them.This is garbage.
0	AmazonBasics Screen Protector Film for iPhone 3G; 3GS; 5 packThis screen protector is not worth 6 bucks! The quality is no better than the Amazon Basic screen protectors which cost less than 1 dollar. I think the ones at the At&t; store last the longest but those are about 5 bucks per scree protector and you have to buy 3 (so its like 15 bucks). I have no idea why this product got such great ratings. The link I inserted above is not for anti-glare but just an example that there are better deals to be had than the phone devil.
2	I didn't like this produvt.  Very hard to attach to the phone.  The air bubbles were very difficult to remove even with the plastic card to run over the screen.
0	I Hate It! ANother idea that just doesn't work. Sure protect your display and you have to HAMMER the glass to get it to recognize your fingers. Worthless!
0	Replaced the glass and the touch does not work and it is very gray.  I wish i could return it but I forgot to do it in time.  Would not recommend getting this...
2	i would never get his again this is harder then it looks.  its easier to do a 4 replacement then this 3 replacement
0	This was the 3rd glass screen (different sellers) that I purchased. The first one I couldn't install because the #2 connector would not snap in place. The second one installed fine but had problems withe the touch screen.This one was shipped quickly but I was unable to install it. The #2 connector did not snap in place. I called to get a replacement was given a refund instead.
2	I love how it fits perfect and I have no problem what so ever I recommend this product to everyone.
2	After replacing my wife's iPhone screen a couple times I decided that it just wasn't worth the hassle of buying the glass separate from the home button and so I bought this preassembled part. It was worth the extra money to just be able to change out the LCD from the broken glass to this glass and then pop the front back in.After reassembling the phone however one of the two bottom screws would not seat into the metal brackets of this screen assembly. This must have been due to a poorly milled metal bracket that just wasn't big enough to accept the screw so I just left the one screw out. I'm giving this 3 stars in hopes that this was more of an exception than the rule and at this low of a price you are getting what you pay for. Also it seems like the quality of the ear speaker was not as nice as the original but again you aren't paying for original quality and the quality is tolerable.Overall this is a cheap fix for a broken screen. Obviously it isn't Apple quality parts but it also isn't $200. If you need an Apple quality end result this may not be for you. If you just want your phone back in working order this is your part.I hope this was helpful. Let me know if you have any questions.
0	Pretty disappointing. I received one that arrived broken sent it back right away. That part was easy. Ordered a new one it arrived intact and I installed it. All went fine with the installation but after getting it back together I find that the home button doesn't work! Dammit. Now I've got a phone that can't be used at all as I can't get it off of Messages which is the first app I chose after turning it back on.
0	I purchased one of these and when it came in the plug from the screen wouldn't stay plugged into the motherboard of the phone so I pushed it to the side and simply ordered another one.  When it came in the glass seperated from the frame.  So once plugged in it couldn't tell where I was touching the screen.  If I touched the 1 it thought I had touched the 9.  USELESS.  After dropping basically over $40 with shipping etc. I still have a useless phone.  I give up.
2	The charger stopped charging after about 4-5 times it will not charge at all the connector is loose. I only got to use it a few times
0	Maybe just a bad one but callers can barely hear me on this.  Using it through an android phone that other mics work fine through.
0	It was disappointing when I tested the headset as it simply did not work. That being said the headphone jack fit but there wasn't any sound. I did not bother to check the mic. I sent it back for a refund.Happy Shopping!
2	Nice headphone works well blocks external noise quite well. however the product is flimsy and after around 4 months of continuos use it stopped working. the mouth piece came off.
0	Lasted about a month before the microphone started to short out and only work intermittently.  I really treated it gently.  Going to try to return it.
2	Good headset. Can wear a long time. Compared the headset with some others like a wired plantronics that has a small boom mic wireless inexpensive jawbone headset and another standard headset that came with my Samsung Epic with Sprint where the mic is on the cord. This headset was pretty dull. Some people complained that it was hard to hear me no matter where I had the mic placed. My voice is a little dull anyway so that made it pretty tough to hear me. Other headsets had a louder volume to them than this one. It wasn't bad just not impressive or did it have a good response. Any input into the mic doesn't come through the speaker in the headset so you never really know what the other person is hearing from you. There is no cutting out of the voice though like with some headsets. The speaker is very clear and is easy to hear others. It doesn't cut out a lot of ambient noise in the room but it's okay. It's hard to make the speaker loud on my phone. I can make other headsets much louder. So if you're in a noisy environment this may not be the right one for you. Overall it's just an average headset. If you will be using something for a long period of time and need a inexpensive headset this is the one for you. If you have a loud voice this one will be great for you. Otherwise I suggest going with another.
2	At this price one cannot expect studio quality. This product is good for conference calls using a cell phone. I've used it for recording and the mic is decent but other more expensive headsets have better quality. The band is too small and it takes some adjusting to get into a good position on the head. A little small for a full grown man. Overall no complaints at this price.
0	didn't work  so cheap i didn't bother to send it back the postage wasn't worth it  buy something else
2	The sound quality is good on one end but bad on the other. I can hear the people I'm talking to very loudly most of the time but many people have said that they can't hear me clearly. Also the sound seems to go in and out sometimes. I've been using this for about a month now and it's getting worse. At first it was great but now it seems like I'm having problems more often than not. It's still worth the price though. For $6 I can't really complain.
2	I have been using a cheap pair of rocketfish headset and I thought I'd try these since they were cheaper $6 vs $14.  Big mistake these are very uncomfortable and they feel much bigger on my head.  I use them as a spare.  There is no quick mute button or volume button on them.  They are simply just a headset.
2	For the price it worked.I needed it for a trip and it allowed me to keep both hands on the wheel.The volume was somewhat low.But it works
2	This headset is more volume power away from being a fantastic headset.  It is very comfortable the microphone picks up your voice extremely well.  With one problem...  The volume is extremely low specially if you are using it in the car you just won't hear the call volume at all.  Very sad so close...  Yet so far.
2	I go this because when I am driving (windows up) no one can hear me on the phone using my bluetooth or stock headphones that came with my note 3. I would always need to shout or speak loud. It became very annoying. I was looking for something that the micophone  can reach to the front of my mouth so people can hear me clearly. This product does well in that. People hear me nice and clear as if I was on the handset its self. The only thing I didnt like about it is that the ear piece should be a bit louder. With my volume up on high I still wish it was loud enough so I myself can hear clearly. Its still worth keeping for the price.
2	Very very uncomfortable.  Doesn't work most of the time.  Looks like a child's toy.  But I read most of the reviews before I bought it and many people who seem very knowledgeable said it was a good buy for the money.  I should have read those last 3 words more carefully.  Thankyou.
2	i like this in the car because I know people can hear me..sits a bit far from my ear though.  I took off the big foam from the mic.  I dont like blue tooth and the tiny mics I seem to have people always say I CANT HEAR YOU.  so I got this it is OK
2	I bought two of these headsets at the same time for use with my blackberry.  The first time I took this out and made a call there were several problems:- One of the headsets had static noise from lose connection at the plug.  Instantly recognizable since the noise comes only when the plug section is touched.- Both headsets were affected by the all-to-popular interference noise of the blackberry which was the primary reason for me buying the headset in the first place.  The noise does not exist with any of the other android or iphone - only on blackberry does this radio noise exist.The construction is decent and wearing it was comfortable.  However the static noise and the interference on blackberry made this useless for me.Not even worth the trouble of returning this to Amazon.  Pay a little more and get something that actually works.Not recommended.
0	The plug does not fit tight in my Iphone 4s and the connection keeps going off.  The headset is very uncomfortable and very very cheap.  Used for about 3 phone calls and gave up.
0	A solid one star! Who are these people leaving 2345 stars??? The entire thing is wrong. The headband was designed to fit giants apparently. The flexible mic has a mind of its own and NO (read ZERO) memory retention. One minute it's adjusted fine and the next it's up your nose or in your mouth. Yes it is comfortable. Why? It fits very loose! As I said it's for extra large heads. When worn over my baseball cap it's fine. The mic not staying in place and being so cheaply held on and unwilling to do anything you want it to though ruins this product for me. It's very cheaply made and I can't imagine it lasting from the thin cord to barely held on earpiece. Trust this review! I would encourage anyone looking for a headset to try anything else. I can't imagine anything being worse. I wouldn't give these away for free! Admittedly this was my first headset and maybe I am expecting too much but I also have owned lots of cheap Walkman type headphones that were wonderful. Why is it so hard to attach a mic??? Hopefully Cellet has fired the person(s) responsible for this design FAIL.
2	This is very bulky and hard to find a place to keep it but the sound is quite good and it is very comfortable. I don't like that it doesn't have a button to receive or end calls on it; which means you have to look away from driving for a second to receive a call. If your phone has an auto answer function this would work but mine does not.
2	OK as everyone has said there is no circuit for the button I could live with that but why have the metal plate there that has had the plastic mounting points melted to hold the plate?You have to cut those off to get the plate off. If they were left un-melted with no plate you could install your original one and then melt them to hold it in place. I had to use a couple of drops of super glue.
2	Nice replacement. Easy to install and all tools included. Button stopped working soon after installing though. Had to tear back apart to replace.
2	Be very careful with this thing it is very fragile. It can break if bent the wrong way at all. The adhesive is also hard to get right. If you get it all in the waay it is supposed to it does fine.
2	When I completed the installation of the screen/digitizer my phone speaker didn't work. My phone was still usable as the speaker phone still works (as well as my headset) because they're not part of this replacement assembly. As I went to remove the screen/digitizer to reseat ribbon 3 (my first method of troubleshooting) and the suction cup pulled the screen from the digitizer. With the screen now detached from the digitizer I had to press firmly on the sides of the screen to even use the touch screen.I ordered an adhesive replacement kit ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y3L5B8 ). I've reattached the screen (like it should have been attached when I purchased the item...) and reassmebled the device yet the speaker still doesn't work. The proximity sensor works though and since this data is passed over the same ribbon as my speaker that doesn't work I believe the speaker was broken to begin with. All in all I am disappointed: the cheaper replacement proved to be cheap indeed.The screen also feels slightly different. My friend who also owns a 3GS asked if I had a screen protector on it. There's a little bit of a border around the LCD screen but that's not the deal breaker in comparison to the non-functioning speaker!
0	never got it too work right but this could have been my fault?by a new phone over spend more mobey and have the pros do it?
2	this is great product with tool and good price too & easy to installed but when they are send product they are missing tool ?
2	worked as advertised.  but somewhat more fragile.it has been a while since I purchased this but I think a piece of hardware was missing as some of the other reviews said.read them.
0	I had bought one of the $8 kits when a friend warned me that I would be spending a lot of time with heat guns and glue. This kit come with a new bevel glued in place. Its worth the few extra dollars to me.Slightly pricey and no instructions. Costs a star.EDIT:So I had gotten 2 of these as both of my kids broke their iPhone glass. They had a lot of trouble with the keyboards soon after. Couldn't press the 'p' key or a whole row of keys. At one point you could hover your finger a half an inch over the glass and blast a bunch of text. The sensitivity was totally out of control. I tried taking it apart and re-seating the ribbon cables to no avail. After some Googling and looking at the reviews here I realized it is an iPhone Proximity Sensor Problem.I paid $30 for a new glass (and frame - no gluing or heat guns needed) from Zeetron. It didn't come with tools but you pretty much just need a jeweler's screwdriver a small suction cup (like for hanging decorations on your window) and a paperclip. It's only been a day but so far it's working perfectly.Now I gave this one star but selfishly because I know 1 star reviews get read more than 2 stars. this product could be considered 2 stars because I've heard you could buy a batch of these and some of them will actually work. I'm able to replace the glass in about 10 minutes now so maybe that is a consideration for some.
2	I think it's important to know who I ordered this item from since there are multiple sellers and quality is most definitely not the same for all: ZHDU1120.I replaced the screen assembly and it went okay I had to jiggle it a little to make it fit. All good until I started the phone up - ear speaker is not working so I'm forced to use speakerphone mode.Ordering from ZHDU1120 (after reading a recommendation from another user) was a huge mistake. Seller sent 1 of the 2 I ordered then sent me extra tools as the second item. Awfully slow shipping too coupled with incorrect shipping of ordered items and a broken item = big waste of time. Overall worst experience with an Amazon seller to date.
0	Dirty screen non working proximity detector faulty ear piece. This item arrived one day late defective and dirty out of the box. Dirty screen non working proximity detector faulty ear piece. This item arrived one day late defective and dirty out of the box.
2	Replaced glass and found out the LCD panel also needed replacement.  Found a great shop at Sugarloaf Mills in Duluth GA.  They added the LCD panel for $40 and $20 labor and used this glass.
2	I was able to get this repair to work one time but then switched to the more complete unit.  Even with You Tube instruction videos this was a bit advanced for me.  It did work though.
0	Just burned my battery. I had to buy new one.. Not worth it and the instructions is an F+ Don't understand a thing! Not worth to buy it! Just been warned
2	Although the item seems like a good idea using this for an extended battery just doesn't work as it can't hold the girth of the battery.  I tried using it also on the normal size S3 battery. For that it worked.
0	Never worked! This was a complete waste of time and money! You are better off going to Radio Shack! Terrible
2	it ok my big brother said t works but it charge slow he ould have to put it on the charger
0	There are NO INSTRUCTIONS with this device.There are many videos on YouTube (some better than others) describing how to use this.Supposedly you align the prongs to the external contacts of the battery (figured that one out on my own) red light comes on. Plug into wall green light comes on.One video describes the middle light flashing when it starts to charge. Does not happen with mine.Two lights on after 5 hours. No charge.Incidentally I bought a mini key-chain charger of the same style which does work with the above procedure. That one connects to USB.So I may have received a defective unit. Seller agreed to refund (cheaper than shipping a new one).
2	The charger works but it looks cheaply made.  Has a VERY strong spring to hold the battery in place but that also makes it difficult to get the battery in the charger.  This does work and if you are looking for an inexpensive charger this is it.
2	This is a little complicated to work but IT ACTUALLY CHARGES batteries I would buy more if necessary not expensive
0	A good battery charger delivers 1.2 amps of current.  This thing deliver .2 amps meaning it takes 5 times longer than normal to charge your batteries.  Also the prongs are very thin so it tends to slip out of the outlet you plug it into.
2	I've tried this device twice carefully following the instructions and waiting a long long time. Even after 24 hours despite the red light and the other blinking red light I don't think it really charged the battery. Each time I put the battery in another charger and it showed low charge and took a long long time to get back to full charge. I guess if you had absolutely no other way in a pinch this might be useful as a last resort. It looks cheap and the design is weird. Would not recommend it.
2	I only rated this charger two stars because it takes so long for this second battery to charge. I have two external chargers that I plugged my spare batteries into and my captivate battery charged much faster then my infuse battery (they both were completely new & needing a full charge). So it works however its taking 7hrs or more to fully charge my spare batteries.
2	The black color of this skin doesn't cover all of it. There is a bright white pronounced border of plastic that was not color coated black. This sticks out noticeably and looks bad. Seller said all of them are like that. Just a lazy manufacturer not finishing the painting job. Adds a considerable amount of bulk to the phone but it doesn't make the phone less slippery to hold. I agree on the lint-collecting complaint. Constant lint build up in areas very difficult to clean.
0	This Droid case is priced very well--it's basically the same item I saw at my Verizon store for $29.95 (which is outrageous for a couple of pieces of moulded plastic).  The material is simple plastic with a slight rubbery texture--not enough to make it very difficult to go in and out of my pocket but provides a little extra grip.  It snaps right on.BUT the product is not worth buying at any price for several reasons.First the case I received was NOT as shown in one very important way:  along the bottom of the front faceplate all of the touchscreen controls are blocked.  I'm sure that previous versions weren't like this or all of the other reviewers would have complained--there are tiny cutouts for the controls that make it literally impossible to activate those functions which I use constantly. It's not about fingertip size--you'd need a stylus to poke through the holes. So I had to cut out the sections of plastic that surround these little holes to make the faceplate like the photo provided on this site.  Since the plastic is pretty tough it can't be done with a knife; I used a Dremel rotary tool.  If you have one and don't mind spending fifteen minutes with it the end result will look like the photo and is functional.  If not the product is virtually useless.Second after a few weeks of gentle use one corner of the case first cracked then tore off.  I treat my phone like it's made of crystal--I'm very very careful with it--so I have no idea how this happened but this is obviously not a very protective case.  Then after another couple of weeks another part of the case cracked.  Then the front plate popped off and just refused to re-attach.  The product is now totally useless after a couple of months of careful use.
2	didn't fit the phone as advertised so I took a match to it and burnt the s*** out of it and threw it away
2	POOR QUILATY MADE WITH I DONT KNOW WHAT BUT BROKE IN 2 SECONDS MAYBE I HANDLED IT WRONG HOWEVER I DONT THINK SO IT FEEL APART BUT I WAS NOT ABOUT TO PAY TO RETURN IT COST WOULD NOT BE WORTH IT.
2	I bought this on Amazon for my Droid 1 and used it about few months. The back cover is solid but the front cover is the one always breaks because the clipping parts fall off. I have used two of these and I think I need to get the higher quality ones.
0	I bought it for my Motorola Droid 2 and it didn't fit I had to really force it and it broke.
2	The Motorola Droid (A855) window mount is fairly basic -- it's well made but not as well made as some of Motorola's older window mounts.A Droid will automatically go into automobile mode when inserted into the holder and the horizontal (landscape) orientation is perfect for GPS (a little clunky for phone -- but you shouldn't be trying to use the keypad while driving anyway).The keyboard won't open when in the mount -- again you shouldn't be using the keyboard when driving... but it'd actually be nice not to have to take the phone entirely out of it to enter an address when you're parked.If you have a Droid 2 the Motorola window mount for that is so much better designed... and there's no reason why this one didn't mate power rather than forcing your to insert the power cord separately.The price isn't bad; but you might not actually get that much more bang for the buck buying Motorola over one of the generic ones... though most of those hold the phone vertically (so weigh how much you will use GPS vs phone).You won't go wrong buying this product -- but it just isn't what it should be.
0	I read the description incorrectly and it did not fit my phone. Did not bother returning since I needed the charger.
2	I sent this charger back once I learned it would not accept the droid if it had ANY case.  I want a case for protection of my Droid so this is unacceptable.Since I ordered a Seidio case I plan on ordering a Seidio car mount/charger as it will accept the Droid with or without the case.  It does cost $10 to $15 more than the Motorolla car mount however.Motorola should realize most owners of their cell phones (especially high end phones) will insist on a case for protecting their investment and offer accessories that accomodate a protective case.
0	i receive it today. i put it on my truck. its works sending the audio to the station selected.i made my first and last call throught the fm transmiter. then it never work again.it really do not work as i wanted.at least it charge my iphone. and hold it in a safe place. just that.the remote did not work with the equipment. i tried with another batteries but it did not want to work.if you are looking for a goos part. do not purchase this.
0	Warranty service is terrible.  Blackberry refuses to provide warranty service unless you purchase the phone directly from Blackberry (which no one does because of price).  You are forced to go to your carrier.  In my case it's AT&T.;  Blackberry makes the carrier go through completely unnecessary steps taking up to 2 hours during which time they'll try to force you to go through the steps and then get back to them.  It also includes a complete reset of the device and loss of all information (mandatory).  The defect in my phone had nothing to do with these steps.  It's solely meant to discourage a warranty return.I was an advocate of Blackberry but now they've lost me.  Avoid at all costs.  One star because 0 stars is not available.My original review was very positive and I rated it 5 stars:Having owned the Nokia e71 HTC Tilt 2 and the Blackberry Bold and Curve in the past few months I feel the Blackberry's have a better design and function.  The Blackberry's are not based on a soft key design (where the keys are based on software on a touch screen) so there's no chance of having a system lockup during an emergency call.  Also the UI is better than the Nokia.  I am very pleased with my Blackberry telephones.  They are solid devices.
0	I bought this phone unlocked so I wouldn't have to pay the monthly data plan to my carrier however I noticed that just by using the wifi to connect to the internet I was having few critical problems that my iPhone didn't have.  Here's what I encountered some of the web pages weren't being opened and others did.  The ones that weren't being opened just gave me a blank page and stalled then I tried going to Yahoo site and it opened to that page without any problems??!!  You might think it was just a fluke or that page I tried opening was a non-active site but I can assure you that I tried with many other sites and it also gave me that same problems.  And then there were other sites that would open but only uses half of the screen so that it made it difficult to read due to the smallness of the images. This problem didn't exist with the other older model wide screen Blackberry with track ball.  Another critical flaw is that the email accounts doesn't work and it wouldn't allow you to create any email accounts.  I believe this is due to the fact that since Blackberry has their own server for the emails and if you have no data plan the Blackberry somehow doesn't allow you to connect to their site.  So the only way you can check your email is by using wifi to access your email account website such as Yahoo Gmail Hotmail and etc.  But then again you would encounter the site either it's going to open up or not as I mentioned from above so it becomes hit or a miss every time you are trying to access some website.  I have an older iPhone and so I wanted to get a newer smart phone and wanted to try out Blackberry since I heard so much about how great their emails and such but if you can't access it then it becomes no better than a dumb phone.  So to pay all that money to get this phone was a waste.  My only suggestion is that if you want to get this phone then make sure you have a data plan otherwise you'll be having all problems I mentioned.  But then again there are sites I mentioned that it would only uses half of the screen so it would be difficult in trying to read the words or viewing the images.  I would just stay away from this phone completely because there are so many other unlocked smart phones without all these problems I mentioned and probably costs much less than this one.
0	This product was very disappointing.  Was never able to get it to adhere to the glass of the windshield for any extended period of time and the quality of construction was poor.  Go ahead and pay the money to get a higher quality version so that you can be satisfied.
0	The part the stick on the window does not hold at all I had to by glue to hold it on.
0	I purchased this item for my iphon 4 earlier in the year.  The mount kept falling off of the clean and dry windshield and dashboard no sooner than i attached it.  Even when I put a dab of clean water to the suction cup to help give it a better hold the thing kep falling off.  I ended up throwing this item in the trash!! i didn't want to waste the time sending it back.My advice to anyone considering this item don't!! It is a waste of your money and your time!!!
0	This is not a good car mount. After having it for a week it broke in 2. I bought it for my Garmin GPS which weighs about nothing so there is no excuse for this mount to malfunction so quickly.
0	small size but very cheaply made.  The pads fell off immediately and the arm snapped with gentle use.  I bought another one that was the same price at a store called Ross Dress for Less.
0	This car mount was NOT durable @ all it shattered the screen to my phone b/c it was NOT strong enough to hold it! This is the worst car mount ever!!!!! Take it off the market!!!!!
0	I had it for only one day and it started to break apart and the paint started coming off. It is not worth it.
0	I wanted a second battery for back up and purchased this due to the price.  Well it's not a real Motorolla battery.  I know that now because I went to the Motorolla site and purchased the $40 battery from them.  I need depenability and that is worth the extra money.I've had my phone for 16 months and the battery it came with is still going strong.  What I noticed is that the original battery and the new one from Motorolla have an X thru a trash can on the back.  This battery did not I hope that helps you stay away from the conterfits.This battery did arrive quickly too bad it didn't last.I got this in mid-July and it died two weeks ago (lasted 3 months).
0	This battery looks similar to the standard battery that came with my Moto Droid. Unfortunately it holds a charge for all of 10-30 minutes before being completely drained. I am definitely not going to be buying from this vendor again.
0	Here is how it worked for me (or actually for my wife who went to a conference in France and then to Amsterdam). I had an old off-the-contract iPhone 3GS that I had AT&T; unlock for me. Installed the SIM card (regular for 3GS - not the micro version) activated the OneSim account on-line and got a USA phone number assigned to it (turned out to be a Texas area code) and the SimCard already had an international (Estonian) phone number printed on it - so all seemed good until over the course of the next 10 days while she was away I discovered the following:Receiving calls1. The US phone number is NOT FREE. It's free to a caller from the US (if they have free US long distance like most people do) but the OneSim account is being charged $0.20 per minute while it is accepting a call placed to that US phone number.2. The international number that the card comes with is the Estonia country code. One of the most expensive out there except maybe countries in Africa. So the OneSim card will not be charged for a call to that Estonian phone number but the caller from the US will pay at their regular international call rate. I tried using my Google Voice (turned out to be $0.33 per minute - for comparison a Google Voice call to Israel or Russia is about $0.02 per minute). Also using MagicJack calling from home was about the same price per minute as Google Voice - and calls to Israel and Russia are also next to free from MagicJack.So it seems like the solution would be to call the US phone number assigned to it and pay $0.20 per minute off the OneSim card account right? Not so really... I paid $40 for it and it came with only $10 credit which pretty much all got used up while I was testing the SIM card (calling/answering and texting to/from) after the installation while still in the US. Oh yes sure you can recharge the SIM card account but it starts with the $25 minimum!Placing calls:Calling from France and Netherlands to the US was about $0.30 - 0.50 per minute! If the account balance drops below the per minute price you can't place calls or receive calls to the US phone number assigned to the card (as would be expected) BUT also you CANNOT receive calls to the Estonian phone number either (which is supposed to be free and not require any money from the SIM card account). So no communication then. The person calling you better check your account balance to see if you have money there to receive a call that is supposed to be free for you. And you can add $25 minimum. That seemed like a scam to get you to pay at least $25 more to continue to use the free features that come with it! My wife ended up having to send me emails using wifi to recharge her account until I figured out to check the balance regularly. I ended up recharging the card account for $50 in the end just so that she would not be without a phone while I am asleep here (time difference).Texting:YOU CANNOT TEXT TO THE US NUMBER ASSIGNED!!! I called the customer service they picked up pretty quickly but the girl at first pretended like she was not sure what problem I was asking about (like no one ever asked about that before) and then sounded pretty annoyed that I was even asking why my texts to the OneSimCard's US phone number get returned with an error message. She explained that it says so in at least three(!) places on the website - so of course you can't text to the US phone number - it's a landline! I asked if I will have to pay my regular international text message fee (AT&T;) to text the Estonian phone number - she said something like Duh... obviously. AT&T; I think takes like 50c to a dollar for one of those international texts. However if you have two iPhones and the international one is connected to WiFi at the hotel or at the conference or wherever then the Blue iMessage will work and will be free to both sides. But you never know. If it turns green after a few minutes you will have to pay for a text message. So I waited for my wife to text me that she is at the hotel before texting her back.She was able to text from WiFi only. I opted out of the OneSim data package when I activated the account. It seemed too expensive to begin with.Technical weird stuff:When you call a US phone number from that OneSim card phone you are not actually calling that number. You are letting their computer know what number you want to call. You dial the number and press Call/Send and the phone immediately hangs up with Call Failed screen. A second or two later it's ringing as if that person were calling you back. You pick up and hear the dial tones - that's when the phone of the person you were calling begins to ring. Not a major inconvenience just seems like not the most elegant way to do it and feels like ancient technology like that should cost next to nothing but it does not!!! (see the pricing above).Conclusion:It was better than nothing (worked for voice calls most of the time - unless the balance was low) but turned out to be much more expensive than I expected. I ended up paying a lot of $$$ on top of the original purchase price and will not be using this card again. I will try to do more research and find a better alternative.I could not believe how many 5-star reviews are out there for this product so I clicked on some See all my reviews buttons next to the glowing 5-star reviews. Seemed like the ones I saw came from people who wrote only one review total. Just for this awesome SIM card and their unparallelled customer service and never any other product reviews. And most of the ones I saw were not Amazon Verified purchase. Maybe whomever wrote them will read this and catch on to that and add a couple more reviews for other products to make it look more legit. In any case this is hardly a 5-star product. Not zero stars (it kind of works for voice calls and you don't pay more than you would have paid if you just brought your regular iPhone abroad) but it's 2-stars at best.UPDATE: The next day after posting this review I got an email from OneSimCard demanding to edit the last part of it and remove the sentence that was there saying that I thought that maybe their marketing guys wrote those 5-star reviews under various aliases. I was happy to remove the sentence to make them happy - everything is clear regardless. I also used that opportunity to change the rating to from 2 stars to 1 star.
0	who buys this junk your better off using silver Duct tape or one of the fashionable colors they offer in Duct tape then this rubber junk
0	This adapter doesn't work for the touch one. Everytime I try to use it it says no microphone found and to please add one. Bs and it specifically says compatible with itouch 1. Well didn't work for me. I should get a refund of some sort but that will never happen!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS FOR ANITOUCH1
0	This thing is a piece of garbage. I decided to try it after reason some decent review here but I don't know what you guys were talking about. It is very poorly built and designed. The sound quality was mediocre at best. The button to play/pause tracks worked about 30% of the time and I would have to push it over and over again to get it to work. The spring-clip does not swivel like it should and snapped off within days of using the product. The strain relief is way too rigid and stiff so it fails to serve as strain relief at all the wire above the male connector started showing signs of damage within weeks and was completely broken within a couple of months of use. Plus on top of all that shipping took FOREVER. Weeks and weeks and weeks of waiting to receive it then nothing but disappointment when I did. In fact the time I spent waiting for the product to arrive was probably greater than the time I spent with a working product before it fell apart and I had to replace it.There are no positive things to say about this product except maybe that it is cheap.If you want a better version that will work well and last longer check out the Audio Technica AT-MP100 Music Phone Headphone Adapter from J&R; also available through Amazon.
0	Sound does not sound good and not all function work a do not buy look for something else. To cheap
0	These are not OEM they are not stamped BLACKBERRY anywhere. but for $3.50 it does not really matter. What does matter is that the small microphone is so far from your mouth some people can not hear you and you need to pick it up and hold it close to your mouth.On the other hands free corded I had the mic was on the wire that went to your ear so it was closer to your mouth by 3 or 4 inches.. seems like a small thing but it made a difference.**********UPDATE***************Let me up date this ..... the above description was for the first one that I opened. Later that week I opened the other two (thinking to keep one in each car and one at the desk) the other two CAN NOT BE HEARD at all no one can hear me when I use it. They are worthless as microphones (the headphone part is fine) so I essentially spent $10.50 for one somewhat working microphone..... CHOOSE ANOTHER....
0	first of all it didnt even fit my phone on top of the fact that it it very translucent when i thought it would be a solid blue. i can honestly say i do not like this phone case. but credit to the seller it did come on time!
0	I bought this on line I think it was something like 68 Cents and it acted like it! broke the first day.You get what you pay for:)
0	Very disappointed.  My friend Daniel swears by the T505 and I bought it based on his recommendation.  Many nice features like the FM radio transmitter which can come in handy.. but what's the point if people can't hear you on the other end of the conversation?  Had to send the first one back after 5 months because people on the other end of the conversation couldn't understand me even though I could hear them fine.  The replacement from Motorola seemed okay at first but after 1 week it too is failing me: my friend said it sounded like I was talking to her underwater but when I switched to my iPhone headset my voice was crystal clear by comparison.  Perhaps the earlier ones were assembled with better components?  My friend still loves his and he sounds fine on it.  I have not had such great luck.  Never wanted to love a product more but this one has been a real disappointment and now I'm out ~$8 in shipping fees and all the time wasted sending the old one back to Motorola to be stuck with another dud.  Ugh.
0	I don't usually read instructions but I had to for this one. And still it kept not working right.Using Blu tooth with my car was a routine reselect and a disappointment.Really can't recommend to anyone.I actually threw it away.  :-(
0	I've been a fan of Motorola products but this unit is driving me crazy.  The battery life is terrific.  That being said it doesn't interface nicely with my Droid X.  It does play music from my phone through my car speakers and if I had any interest in that I guess I would be happy with it's performance.  Supposedly you just push a button and it will ask you what command you wish to use.  Well sometimes it does that.  Sometimes it does nothing and sometimes it dials whatever the last number I dialed was and will continue to do that until I turn it off.  Disappointing is the mildest accolade I can apply although abysmal does come to mind.
0	I'm currently shopping for another Bluetooth. This thing is horrible. there is no sense of no security while wearing it it just hangs on your ear!  It beeps and disconnects even though the phone is on your hip or in your hand! don't buy it! I'm very dissapointed in this piece from motorola!!
0	This worked fine until it didn't work at all. Not even 6 months after I bought it it stopped working. Motorola support couldn't figure out why. Fully charged and successfully paired I could hear nothing from it. It wasn't on mute either it just stopped working. If I could give it 0 stars I would but Amazon's lowest rating is 1 star.
0	This is a poorly designed head piece. The over the ear holder is just plain ineffective. It hangs precariously on your ear and don't think about moving your head suddenly you'll be picking it up off the ground. Because it slips and slides at will it is hard to communicate. I have to hold it in place for a successful dialogue. Of course that removes the 'hands-free' feature doesn't it? I've tried every conceivable solution to make it stay snug to no avail. I paid $45 for it and very much regret it.
0	We bought this hoping it would last years like out last set Not the case... Sometimes a good deal has a reason behind it.
0	This was dead on arrival.  I thought it would be as wonderful as all the other 720's I have had in the past so I took a chance on the bulk packaging but I was soooo wrong!! This thing was DEAD Dead dead.  I returned it and bought one in the proper packaging.
0	Nor Skype nor music etc.  If all you need is to talk the H720 is fine; but if you have a smart phone and need to make calls while driving and not taking your eyes off the road this headset is not for you.  Mine is currently listed on Ebay.
0	Low  volume wants to fall off. Typical problem with BT makes them unusable. I am a ups driver so the BT needs to stay on and overcome the the noise of traffic and my truck and wind. Tried 3 plantronics 2 noisehush and this motorola. They were all garbage except the noishush clip on. I finally found a winner as the battery lasts longer bout 9 hours and it kept the cord away from my phone stayed in my ear and overcame the noise.
0	This battery promised much more than it could deliver. It didn't perform as expected and wasn't worth the money I paid for it. The tools were more worth the money than the actual battery itself.
0	Although I received multiple covers there were only three that were of good quality.  The others weren't as good.  I was disappointed but you get what you pay for.
0	None of the 5 worked for my iPod Touch (tested on a system with known working USB port and iTouch; in other wordsI just replaced a different working cable with each of these one at a time and waited several seconds: no charging no device recognition by iTunes nothing at all to indicate the cable was passing through any signal at all).
0	Long and short of the story: this product does not work.the most rubbish i have ever seen offered for sale.bought a nokia charger from amazon that worked and continues to work like a charm so i am REALLY disappointed.
0	Well I was duped. I thought I was smart enough to avoid getting a fake knockoff but I wasn't. This is not OEM blackberry. It looks pretty close but the seller I bought from (Orange Discount Center) sold a fake one.Now if this was OEM it would have got 5 stars.
0	Though I am leaving the BlackBerry ecosystem in a few months (after having a BB for the last 7+ years) my almost two year old BB Bold 9650 was resetting by itself ALL the time. If I rebooted the phone (when it locked up on me) the battery would be dead (or 2% left) when the phone came back up. Browsing Twitter or news-feeds or email or any program always resulted in the phone resetting by itself (and a dead phone). I had at the most 20 minutes of talk time before my phone died on me. This became downright embarrassing. I simply could not use the phone. So needing a phone that worked for two months before I jumped the Blackberry ship I figured I would try this battery.No more automatic resets. I can view my news-feeds for as long as I like and talk time is no longer a problem. This is all I wanted -- a workable phone to get me to the end of my contract. Too bad RIM dragged their feet so long with BlackBerry 10. RIM lost me as a customer because of their inability to get a quality and competitive phone to the market (in a reasonable amount of time).UPDATE: November 16 2012I purchased this battery 60 days ago and though it worked just fine for me when I purchased it from Amazon I'm lucky if I get two (maybe three) hours out a single charge now. The earlier reviews about this new battery not holding a charge were spot on. If you need a new battery this is NOT the battery you should buy.
0	I should have read the reviews a little closer and realized that this not a NEW battery.  You are purchasing a USED battery.  It came with a sticker identifying the original Blackberry model that it was reclaimed from and the test date.  In addition please note that the moisture sticker has been activated meaning it was very likely exposed to some sort of water damage.  Very disappointed.
0	This battery will not hold a charge. I would get about 4 days of use out of my old battery. This one is done in under 2 days with my usage not changing. Will try to return it and use my old one.
0	I know I ordered this but I never remember getting it. I ordered a couple of them and this is one that I did not receive because of the low price guess I didnt have time to complain.
0	Although it is a really cute case it can't stand up to daily use. I lost one black pearl in under 24 hours and I promise you I am very careful with my phone. I guess sitting in the phone pocket of my purse is too much. I was a little disappointed with the look as well: I thought they were black rhinestones (given the name which says rhinestones and the shiny picture) but they are actually just black plastic pearls.
0	These were not that sticky and they were as thin as they could be. My wife went threw the first phone due to the protection it scratche up real fast.
0	The item I received is not the item pictured. The skin I received covers the Send and End Buttons and also the battery indicator light. I am in the process of trying to resolve this with the seller; however the seller claims the item pictured is the one I received.
0	I ordered this headset since I broke my original that came with my Nokia X6. I wanted original headset and I bought this even though i had many cheaper options. I had to return this since when ever i used it during a call the other party used to get a lot of disturbance because of the headset. So atleast this was not for my X6.
0	Let me tell you something about this place. I've tried for the past two weeks. To get my right case for my cell phone. And the first order he sent me the screen protector that was fine the two cases he sent me were no good they did not fit. My cell phone which is a droid 2. So I said that I wanted to send back your the two cases that don't fit. And he said no he sent me another clear case that didn't fit either. And I must've told him in three e-mails they did not fit. So I have her back to him since I e-mailed them telling him the second clear case does not fit a droid 2 global. So I gave up on it. He does not want me to do a preview of his product. Place no good. Sincerely Thomas. PS at this point I don't care what the guy does I'll never buy another from an outfit. That's for sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	I've had the HTC Hero for almost a year and can honestly say that this is the worst cell phone I have ever had the displeasure of owning. There are so many bugs and glitches in this thing that it's better suited as a paperweight. Yes I have done all the updates and am using the app killer and it's still junk. My 2 major gripes are battery life and lag. PLEASE before buying this phone do an internet search and check out the numerous sites that are dedicated to this piece of junk phone.**UPDATE**I am still under my 2 year contract with this phone (2 months to go) and it's still a collosal piece of junk. Absolutely the worst phone I have ever had. I can't saying anything good about this phone. I think HTC should refund everyone who bought this phone seriously. HTC knowingly put out a phone that they knew was a complete piece of junk! Anyway do not buy this phone!
0	Apparently either Seidio dropped the ball or Motorola changed the dimensions of the phone after Seidio created it but whatever the root cause the front half of the case won't stay attached. Browsing some of the forums I see similar complaints. In theory very nice but the one I got just doesn't fit and is being returned.
0	This is a fairly nice case.  Unfortunately it only lasted about 3 months until the little tabs the hold the front cover on broke off.  I'm not sure how I'm supposed to give it more than one star since it didn't last long enough to be any better than the $5 cases you can get here.  Sadly I think that the biggest weakness of all of the cases for the phones that slide open to reveal the keyboard is that they are two piece and I can't see a way to make them more durable.  Seems like it would be better to just avoid phones with slide out keyboards.I don't see a point in asking for my money back since it's just a phone case and the hassle of sending it back isn't worth it.  I just won't buy another case from Seidio since they only sell high-priced cases.
0	Bought the extended battery and the innocase front and back for the extended battery to use on my moto droid.The battery in less than 90 days has come apart.The case back is ok.The case front pops off whenever it feels like it and is useless at this point. All within a matter of a few months.Seidio will replace their garbage with new garbage after going through a dog and pony show and giving you 7 days to respond to their RMA which they send via email. 7 days from when they sent the email which means if you don't get it due to spam filtering or other issues  you're screwed.A defect like a battery coming apart and a case wearing out because the tabs are not good enough should be covered by a refund more than just 14 days. They know it's crap.There are other covers that are on the market that are made better fit cleaner and stay on. Seidio is overpriced foreign crap pushing their sweatshop products into the American market just like every other 3rd world country is doing right now. Just because they have a website doesn't mean their a good company.Like crap buy Seidio.
0	Doesn't last. front frame cracks and falls off and the rest of the case fits so tight it cracks when going from hot to cold environment. Think: getting of of your warm car in the winter with your phone in a pocket. Customer service sent me a new one free but it did the same thing. They make good cases just not for this phone!
0	Contacted the seller and he sent me a note claiming it was delivered so I guess that's that. Better luck to the next person who orders these. I wont be using this seller again.  Who cares about a great price if you never get the product.
0	they sucked packing mine and no instructions on how to use didnt know what i was doing with these thanks to this company for all the help
0	Update: October 4 2010 from a letter I just sent to Otterbox..Dear Otterbox:I am writing to let you know of another defect in your Defender case for the Bold 9700 by BlackBerry.Please do not send a replacement. It will be discarded and not installed.When I purchased your case I had previously been using Zagg's Invisible Shield for my devices. I purchased the Defender both from the advertised design and as a result of word of mouth endorsements for Otterbox and your overall reputation.As much as I liked the hard core techy look of the Defender there is also some hassle factor - dismantling to do a battery pull blowing talc air on the screen at cleanings to avoid the watermark on the screen etc.I could put up with all of this but not with the numerous defects.First there was the holster then a cracked window then the tabs on the case breaking from the pressure of the holder clips. The last straw was a repeat of the last making the holster completely unusable.I have thrown out the latest broken case and the holster you just sent - along with all of the parts and silicone sleeves I was keeping as spares.Did it escape your attention when you designed this that cases are not supposed to be intricate systems demanding constant care repair and other attention - that they should just protect the phone and not be given a second's thought otherwise?Also looking over your site and other reviews about the 9700 Defender it is obvious Otterbox cut corners in its design. For the little money you might have saved you must have lost it in the warranty claims. In my case alone (pun intended) you have sent numerous parts free of charge including shipping - including at least 2 but maybe even as many as 3 complete replacements. There is no way you could have made any profit from your sale of this to me at this point.Unfortunately I cannot recommend you on to others given my experience. I will in all fairness agree that Otterbox stands behind its products - but that is only half of the equation. The other half is making a product worthwhile to stand behind - and this case Otterbox failed. Since it is the only product of yours I have tried I would be loath to try another product of yours without giving another manufacturer a chance.In this situation I am ordering a Zagg screen shield and have dusted off my BlackBerry cheapy free holster.SincerelyAdam LamarBurbank CAOriginal Review:I just received my own case today having bought the Blackberry Bold about 2 weeks ago. It is my first experience with an Otterbox product.First The case is like nothing else I've seen. And there appears to be a significant improvement over the Defender for the Blackberry Bold 9000 Series - there is now a clear film shield that fits in place very well and very easily over the keyboard leaving an opening for the electronic touchpad. Otterbox got rid of the film for the screen and replaced with a clear hard polycarbonate screen that is affixed to the polycarbonate portion of the case. So NO worries about screen clarity bubbles etc. Once everything's together you can't even tell anything's there.The case assembled fairly quickly.Use: I like it - the buttons were all premolded out on the inner film so it's about the same as not having the shield. The trackpad takes a bit of getting used to in the up direction. Otterbox accounted for this by cutting into the polycarbonate part a bit but you can still feel something. It's not bad but just something you have to get used to.The side buttons I find actually much easier to find and use with the extensions Otterbox made on the silicone skin - so here you have an improvement over the original blackberry.The top buttons for Lock and Standby/Mute also have silicone extensions and easy access.The only drawback I could find in the case itself is no immediate access to the battery/SIM compartment but to create such access I think would have severely compromised the protective quality of the case. There's a program called QuickPull I tried that simulates a full battery pull - but it does not work on the 9700 version yet. That was my own experience and all other reviews I read indicated the same. So hopefully until QuickPull resolves this you will have to get by with the soft-reset by pressing alt-shift-delete.The sound screen resolution etc are perfect.Holster - there is some controversy on this if you search online for reviews. Otterbox made a change from their original sleeve design to a dual-clip that the phone ratchets in and out of - so you can't really slide the phone in you have to go in diagonally and snap in place. Also - VERY important - the screen must be facing in toward your body - not outward - they did this on purpose for another layer of protection.. Fit seems snug enough to me but I was able to deliberately pop out the phone by accident. I can see where users of previous models would be less than pleased by the change. I prefer to wear the phone in a horizontal rather than vertical position. I'm sure this will help prevent accidental bumps that could dislodge the phone. It is so new I'll have to wear a few days and will follow up on this page. I am not thrilled with the holster design but it might be ok. I am going to keep my eyes open and if Otterbox ever does update the holster with their original design I'll probably pick it up. Either way in my own opinion this isn't bad enough to pass on the case or even the holster.CheersAdam LamarUpdates:1) Have worn around for about a week now. The phone has NEVER popped out of the case by accident. I personally like wearing it horizontally because of the bulk of the phone with the case comfort and better control taking the phone in and out. Maybe this makes a difference?2) I found a watermark does appear on the hard screen. I also ran across a video on how to get rid of it - and it works![...]
0	We bought 3 pair of these. 1 pair the ear piece detached within 24 hours. The second one within 72 and the final within a week. The company was willing to replace but I didn't bother. With all 3 breaking within a week it would have been a wasted to bother but I wanted to be fair to let you know they were willing to replace.The sound quality was nice but the construction is the problem.
0	I was really excited when I received this item. It appeared sharp looking good fit and with all the reviews I thought I was done shopping for an iPhone case.I am extremely disappointed!! This case doesn't fit no matter what I do. I thought maybe I bought the wrong case so I tried it on an iPhone 3 3G & 4 and it would not fit on any of them. I've come to the conclusion that I've wasted my money. The iPhone is flat this cover is curvy. I don't understand how anyone who left a review can say that this is a good product.I'm mailing it back and yes I'm also expected to pay for the shipment to return it. The cost combined to have it shipped to me + the cost to send it back = more than the cost of the case itself.I'm extremely disappointed.
0	totally disappointed. wanted something that can move easily in and out of pocket because my otterbox is too bulky and is hard to get in and out of pockets.  with all the good reviews i thought this was what i was looking for.  sadly it is not.  i paid $8 for a flimsy piece of plastic.  if you drop your iphone a lot do not purchase this.  if you were to drop the iphone on its face there is no protection. I have returned this and ordered the speck case.  at least the speck case has a rubber protective interior with a smooth outer case.  i know the speck case will break at the charging port area but it will def protect my expensive iphone far more than this elago case.
0	I've had SEVERAL of these some were exchanges and I even sent one to the company VXI for repair. IT IS GARBAGE! It is a great concept having more volume than other blue tooth units. I tried to get them to repair it and now they either fired ALL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS or they are simply IGNORING my requests for them to repair an item that has a ONE YEAR WARRANTY? Good luck if you do purchase this do so at your own risk.
0	This product was advertised as a Sync & Charger USB cable for Barnes & Noble Nook...  don't wast our money or time.  This product is a standard micro USB cable - nothing more nothing less.  The micro USB for designed to different specs... the tip is a bit longer.  This standard tip is not long enough to make a connection.  ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!  FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!The seller obviously had not tested his product!
0	As said in the title this does not charge the nook Color. I am left with an uncharged NC and a useless cable.
0	What can I say............they DON'T work. And B&N doesn't have them. It cost more to send these back. I have the HD now ordering extra charger just in case it breaks.. My search continues..
0	First the shipping was bad - it took them 5 days to get it to my place and then it got returned by the post-office. Then it took them 7 more days to send it in.Coming to the product the protector does not fit the screen completely it is not designed correctly and there are tons of air bubbles left inside (maybe that's why there is a pack of 3 - waste at least 2 or something).Don't waste your money on this product.
0	This is the 2nd extended life battery I've gotten from this company.  One for my blackberry storm 9530 and the other for my Motorola droid.  Both batteries delivery the same results.  Initially the battery life was about ..... EVEN at best with my stock battery now I'm a month or more into the battery and I'm charging it at noon time just to keep the phone functional.I would avoid this battery at all cost because it's just not a very good product.  I also purchased the external skin for protection etc and am quite dissappointed.  Avoid and wait for a better solution.I would have given the product no stars but the review process wouldn't allow me to do that.  Save your money and buy an additional stock battery.  That will work better for you.
0	these people wants me to retrack what i wrote as a review when it is the truth .look when your company sent me the iphone and it is not working i i contacted your company and told you that all i wanted is my money back nit how to fix it my money .the only thing your company can do is come up with an excuse on how to upgrade when in the papers you sent with the 90 day warranty is not to do upgrade or and hard set or anything that would void the phone so please stop emailing me a lie .this is in your company hands simply send the shipping label that i been asking for and this can be over .your company is handling this matter worse than a bad sore.maybe if your company had done the right thing from the start this would have not happen.so sorry for anyone else who may go through this
0	The connector broke after only a month's gentle use!  This thing sucks.  Don't buy it!  Got one from ebay cheaper.  Even if it breaks at least it wasn't a rip-off.
0	This charger did not charge at all! I was upset and just tossed it into the trash can. Very disappointed.
0	Great speady service but unfortanatly none of the four leads worked said unsuported (iphone4) tryed on 2 iphones and one ipod so contacted the seller who sent out a replacement but was only one lead didnt work so gave up and went to best buy and paid 4 times more but at least that one works
0	This product is supposed to cut the glare and doesn't.  You need a cover to avoid finger print smudges but a cheap cover will do that.
0	I have tried several of these blue tooth hands free car kits/speaker kits (under $50) by several different manufacturers and all of them have been disappointing.  THIS ONE IS NO EXCEPTION.  After reading so many rave reviews I took the chance and bought two of them at a great price.  I agree with several other posts: unit is very light and small but feels cheap like you could easily break it.  It gets cool points for solar which appears to keep it charged all by itself with minimal usage.  The mounts are a problem.  The slide in case with the suction cups easily loses the spongy grommets used to cushion the case between the window glass.  The clip on case used for a visor has a small clip and would not clip onto the visor of my 09 Tacoma.  After prying it open and praying it wouldn't snap off the plastic it awkwardly sits on the visor BUT the position of the clip does not allow you to flip the visor down and let the sun charge the unit unless you take it out and flip it over and re-insert it into the holder so the panels are out.  You then have to remember to re-insert face up before use because the buttons and speaker would be up against the visor.  THE BIGGEST PROBLEM is the most important.  The speaker LIKE ALL THE OTHERS sucks!  The volume is way too low.  I have tried it on the windshield and on the visor and my callers are a whisper at 65 MPH on the freeway windows up AC fan off and no radio on.  City streets are no better.  This is with both units in both a pick-up truck and a small SUV.  When speaking to people the complaint is that you sound far away and tinny the volume is TOO LOW on both ends with the volume on the unit at full.  This was tested with a blackberry and a motorola cell phone on BOTH speakers I bought.  Placing the unit on the visor and flipping the visor down so that it's almost at mouth level makes it a little better but then your vision is blocked by the visor.  Completely disappointed.  I am giving up on these type of systems they just don't have the volume and speaker capability we need.  I am assuming the only true option is a built-in vehicle system.  Maybe my next car.... VIDEO REVIEW:  [...]
0	Got mine in July 2012 RIP on my vacation Oct. 4th.  I just used it to charge my Droid 4 phone when traveling and could get a couple charges out of it.  Appears to be a short where the plug flips up and down on the ZAGGSPARQ2.0.  Will not charge or charge my devices.  Called Zagg and they are sending replacement but require a charge card to send me a new one.  I then have 60 days to send the other one back.  I would have preferred to have just sent the item back and they send me a new one.  I do not like the idea of having to give a charge card to get a FREE warranty replacement. I like the form factor and design but should have listened to the other reviewers and gone for another brand battery pack/charger. I asked if they will send me the new model Zaggsparq6000 that replaces the Zaggsparq2.0 but they said I would get the old model instea.  Hopefully this one will not be a lemon.  If so I am going to insist they give me the new model since it is clear by all the bad reviews this ZAggsparq2.0design has issues.
0	The specs on this are great.  However the battery drains on its own.  I've charged it completely only to find that it's drained (although not used) on its own before I even got to my destination.Look elsewhere.
0	I was anxious to use the ZaggSparq 2 since I travel and drag along a couple of IOS devices.  After 1 week anytime I plug in the device to try and charge my iPhone I get the error message This device doesn't support chargingI have to believe that version 2 is still not ready.  Maybe a version 3 will actually work.
0	I have had a few different Jabra bluetooth models and this one just didn't make the cut.  Unless your ear is exactly the size of the earpiece it won't sound correct and if you are trying to adjust the headset since the button is right at the bottom you will either re-dial or disconnect a call.  for the few minutes that I was able to get the earpiece perfectly aligned it did sound great until the headset shifted and then I couldn't hear anything.
0	no no no no no no no no no. cheaply made. looks cool but functionality is useless.  couldn't use it for anything.  battery was super poor.  would never buy again.  ever. actually i returned it because  it was so bad
0	Wow. My original review is below. Then I gave this thing to my wife. In less than a week it was malfunctioning and now it doesn't work at all. I am very disapointed now. I've never had a review become so inaccurate so fast. Truly disappointed. Don't buy!!!First let me tell you a little about my cell phone use. Predominantly my calls are less than thirty minutes and I tend to use my phone for less than two hours a day. As such the battery life on this is not an issue for me. I can put it in the charger overnight and then use it again the next day. Perfect!Second it is worthwhile to note that I have used this for a couple of weeks and I haven't had any major problems with it yet.That said there are many reasons that I like this headset. First the noise-cancelling seems much better than on the Plantronics headset that my significant other and I also share. When someone is speaking to me through that headset I sometimes have a hard time hearing what is being said but with this we haven't had any problems yet. Second the earpiece is actually small enough! I have had a hard time finding one that doesn't hurt my ear after a while but I can wear this all day with no problems. Beautiful! Third the volume feature makes the nerd in me squeal with joy every time I use it (which is pretty often trying to turn the volume up on incoming calls). You basically slide your finger up or down the body and a sweet little series of clicks tells you whether you were successful. Fourth unlike many others I like the Call Answer/Power button. Careful insertion at the beginning of the day prevents any problems (it only turns off if you hold it for 3-4 seconds anyway) and answering is a snap (particularly compared to some other models that I have used).The downsides for this lovely little piece of technology? It only resides in your right ear and the incoming volume doesn't go quite high enough. The charge in the charger doesn't last a week but...would you really expect it to?All told I was very pleased. Considering buying another one so that we both have one!Grade: AHarkius
0	I wanted to like this thing (the Jabra Stone). Turns out this is a lemon although a pretty lemon. The idea of a bluetooth headset that was unobtrusive was highly appealing to me since I didn't want to go for the 'connected to my phone all the time' look. I was also interested in something to permit me to talk hands-free while driving. The Jabra Stone sucks awfully while driving. It's just plain mediocre (which it should not be for the price) while relatively stationary. The microphone does not pick up your voice very well and the speaker built into it is insufficient. There is a clip for attaching the base to things but it didn't help because I couldn't find a comfortable place to put it.The fact that you can charge the headset in the little base is an interesting feature but it stops at the novel concept stage. It gives you the impression that the headset can go for long periods of time without a charger when in fact the battery life is worse than most headsets on its own. Long conversation? You're screwed. Listening to music on this is pathetic. Would not buy again. Would not buy Jabra again.
0	VERY FRUSTRATING!!! I removed the Stone from its elaborate packaging plugged it into the base and charged for two hours until the red light indicator turned off (as instructed).  Afterward I paired it with my new Droid made a few test calls and could not stay connected beyond hello and a few words.  The earpiece kept inexplicably dropping its connection to the phone.  I kept reconnecting it and tried more calls but any attempts to maintain a pairing beyond a minute was an exercise in futility.  I then attempted to test it on a different phone an LG ENV2 only to discover that the earpiece would only stay powered on for a few seconds before it stopped functioning altogether.  I  plugged the earpiece back into the base and tried charging it again.  After several additional hours I tried pairing with the ENV2 again.  The earpiece still would not stay powered on for longer than a few seconds. I finally gave up.As far as design the Stone is sleek and attractive however the styling is a double-edge sword.  During the brief moments it did work I encountered difficulty getting the earpiece to position properly in my ear.  Any attempt to adjust it (as well as attempting to adjust the volume) resulted in inadvertently hitting the answer/end button which along with the volume slider is located internally just beneath the outer surface of the earpiece.  The touch sensitive controls are a cool idea in theory but if you have to touch the earpiece for any reason you  risk inadvertently ending your call.  The power cord for the AC adapter is also very short (roughly 12-inches long).The included documentation (a fold-out quick-start poster) offered no help for my issues.  I checked Jabra's website and their compatibility chart indicated the Stone should be compatible with both phones I tried.  Their knowledge base articles  offered no help for my particular issue.Although I may have gotten a lemon an Internet search revealed several people experiencing the same erratic behavior with the Stone losing its Bluetooth connection moments into a call.  I only believe I got a lemon  because the earpiece has stopped working altogether.  However the similar issues relating to loss of pairing  does makes me wonder if some of these have a design flaw causing a short or failure to properly charge.  My new out-of-box experience with the Stone left a lot to be desired or even accomplished.
0	I did not like this device.
0	This was an impulse buy sort of. When I was buying my htc EVO phone at a Sprint store the salesman recommended this headset to me I agreed and he paired it up to my phone. I returned the Stone for a refund less than 48 hours later. I couldn't get it to stay in my ear. (Note that as a result of its design there's no way to adjust the way it loops over your ear.)And every time I touched it I inadvertently hit some concealed switch that messed up its function.Yes it's pretty. But it's a great case of form over function with controls that are cleverly concealed. From everyone. Including the user.I never got a chance to experience its battery life because it kept flopping around on my ear and I couldn't bear to have it there for more than a few minutes. In the limited time it stayed put where it was supposed to be it did seem to work OK. But the flopping around was physically irritating like a pesky insect buzzing around your head. I nearly threw it out of the car window in disgust about the 10th time it flopped out of position. Then I remembered how much I'd paid for it and placed it carefully in the console.If your ears are configured just right so that it will fit you or if you are so smitten with the design that you can tolerate the hassle of poor fit this expensive headset is for you. Me? It only took a few hours for me to develop a hate for it.
0	There are MANY technical features to like about this product:  2 device connectivity stereo audio noise cancellation etc.But before any of that matters comes comfort and fit.This device ONLY fit in the right ear.  I did a search on the Amazon product description and this is not mentioned ANYWHERE!  I prefer to wear my earphone in my left ear so this was already close to a non-starter for me.I decided to still give it a shot though.  In my right ear I found the headset to be completely un-adjustable.  The angle the depth it goes into my ear etc ... all do not lead to a good fit and the headset feels lose and moving around.I've owned a BlueAnt headset for quite some time ... and it doesn't take much adjustment to allow for a good fit.  But it does take some and this device has zero.
0	As many of you know internet phone purchases are NOT the way to go. This is an inferior phone with tons of issues. Don't buy it's not worth half of what they charge and hasn't worked properly since the day I had it activated. I was definitely ripped off but now you know/
0	When i got the charger it didnt work so i still had to go out nd buy a new one......
0	This battery will not stay charged I am not very happy with it but I did not pay much for it ether.  I guess its is better than nothing.
0	This is not the product I expected. I always had trouble while talking using this product. The person at other end had always issue in hearing whatever I say. I will never recommend this product.
0	it doesnt fit so it doesnt work in a usb port...I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!
0	I don't recommend this. If there was a zero rating it would get that. After a week it stopped charging on it's own and just died
0	I GOT IT IT SEEMED TO BE CHARGED A BIT SO I PLUGGED IT IN AND LEFT IT CHARGING OVER NIGHT. I PLUG IT INTO THE IPHONE4 IT SAID IT WAS CHARGING BUT MY BATERY LIFE WAS NOT INCREASING..... I TRIED 3 MORE TIMES ALSO UNSUCCESFUL... I THREW IT IN THE GARBAGE
0	I purchased this for my iPhone 3g and the charger plug was slightly crooked when i received it.  It is now loose in the metal housing.  The battery works and charges well etc but mine is not well made.
0	I bought this very long time ago. The case is simple it doesn't work. It won't stay connected to the phone. And after a while it never recharged again so I had to tossed in the trash.
0	Keep in mind at this time I had the iPhone4.  When I bought this product I knew it wouldn't be too good but it could work &#34;OK.&#34;  It didn't!  I charged this little thing and when I used it for my iPhone which was on around 25% it only charged it 5%!
0	Worked then diedIt died after maybe 10 uses..Junk junky junk junky junk from land of junkPiece of s***e
0	Please do not waste your money on this product. I purchased this thinking it would be a quick solution if i was critically low on power and did not expect much with the five dollar price tag. However using this on my phone on multiple occasions it could barely keep up with my phone under a normal load of me launching a browser or watching a video.Whether my unit is defective or not i do not know but what i can say is that all four lights are on after a supposed full charge but after half hour of use its already drained to 2 lights and has barely charged my phone 4%.In regards to design do not expect this device to fit on a phone with a case without having to physically hold the phone and unit together. Letting go will almost surely result in you not receiving a charge.I have also tried it without the case and any small movement will cause the product to disconnect.If you are looking for any type of dependable battery backup this is not the unit for you. It reminds me of putting batteries in the freezer for that last bit of juice but they fizzle out quickly.
0	This is one of the worst products i have purchased the thing is made of plastic and just by holding it you can tell its really cheap. Also it doesn't charge your phone more than 10% even when it says its on full capacity
0	If you are someone trying to decide whether to buy this product or not I can give you an answer: ABSOLUTELY NOT.I bought this recently and received it in the mail this afternoon. Plugging my sync cable into the bottom of the recharger was a snug fit but I didn't push it. I wiggled it a bit (as I would to get my cable into my phone) and it started charging. The second time I tried to plug the sync cable into the bottom of the recharger it showed that it wasn't charging. Uh oh. Taking it out again showed the problem - the slot to plug in at the bottom had loosened broken and been shoved up into the plastic casing. What? I had this piece of crap for about ten minutes before it broke and was rendered completely useless.DO. NOT. BUY.Edit: A day after I left this review I received a call from the seller. They were willing to reimburse me without my having to return the broken item so I got back my wasted money and threw the crap charger in the trash. That was nice of them. However I'll leave this review up to save others the pain of buying this piece of trash.
0	This item never worked for me. It showed the lights and everything but never actually charged my phone. Maybe I just received a dud.
0	The first word is 'clunky'. I am using this for an iPod 4G and the thing barely stays attached. This is not as 'case' issue it seems simply to be the connection. If I try to use the iPod and no you can't get sound out of it while attached it is a real effort just to keep it attached. I left it connected in my backpack to try and recharge it but it seems the slightest position movement prevents it from working. It also seems to weigh about the same as the iPod itself. Can't recommend for an iPod. Can't comment on the iPhone.
0	When this thing was showing a full charge it would only charge my iPhone up maybe 5% before this thing was already past halfway depleted. Garbage.
0	It showed up at my house and  never worked with my iPhone horrible product. For those of you who received one That actually worked I'm very happy for you because My experience With this product was a huge fail...
0	The battery came charged so I was able to charge my iphone with it.  Charging was slow but worked.  Price couldn't be beat.  Attached a cable to charge the battery for the first time and the bottom charger port popped off and is now rattling inside the unit.  Poorly built guess it's hit or miss.  You get what you pay for.
0	Half the time when connecting it to the iPhone it charges for a few seconds and then stops.  It can't decide how much power it has I sometimes will connect it and it will show that it has three power lights and then it will stop charging the phone.  I reconnect it and it shows now that is has one power light.
0	plugged it in for a few hours and still hasn't fully charged plug it into your phone doesn't even raise it one percent! don't waste your money! feels extremely cheap!
0	I bought 3 these for use with 4 of our families iphone4's only one worked properly and it only charged it about 70%.  One did not work at all and the other maybe charged it 45% if that.
0	I know you're looking at this thinking; WOW!!! 1900mAh backup battery charger. That's a whole lot better than the 1000mAh one you also see here and other places. Walk away now!! I have the 1000mAh one and it has worked dozens of times over the last year. My folks wanted one so for $5 I went ahead and bought them both one and a backup for me. After using all 3 exactly twice each they are completely dead. Do NOT fall victim to the hype that these charge better than the other ones just because they put a bigger mAh number in the title. Avoid this item from ANY seller at all cost. Yes i actually put that I hate this product just because that's what they call 1 star. I just could not give it 2 stars and still look at myself in the mirror.
0	This item does not workDo not buy itI would have sent it back and bitched about but it was cheap and I just threw it in the battery boxDoes not work on my I pad
0	Worthless! Doesn't even stay on to charge my phone. Don't waste your time on this product. Hope I can get my money back.
0	The plug was always very flimsy and wobbly and then it just stopped working after only a few weeks of use.
0	I had to receive this twice and it still did not charge my phone barely and on top of it all when you have a case on your phone it will not fit in the phone to charge.
0	I had to give it a star but it didn't deserve one.  This worked once and no longer charges or keeps charge. Waste of money. I bought similar ones for a different company works two years later this one disappointed.
0	This thing charged my phone once and then never worked again. It gave me some error message-I just threw it out.
0	The title says it all. It's a very very cheap piece of junk. If it works at all it fails in a few months. I have gone through 2 of them. They keep changing the product name to shed the bad reviews.
0	I was sent two of these batteries as the first one didn't work at all for my iPhone 4S. when I plugged it into my phone of the four lights two went out and. After 20 mins all lights were dead and I actually lost 1% battery power. After the company sent me a second one I did the same thing. The exact same thing happened. Neither battery worked at all. Not one bit. I am guessing the feedback left of a positive nature is from people the company asked to. They are not true. You can waste your money if you want but read the real reviews. This product is not real. I don't believe there is an actual battery in there at all. As it does not charge the phone at all. Both batteries were fails. Do not waste your money at all. This is some sort of scam and Amazon is doing nothing but letting it happen. Have a nice day and you have been warned
0	This item did not even work when I got it even though I charged it for hours.......and hours. PASS on this item.
0	I bought two of this work for a week and start not holding charge end up throwing it away didn't want to deal with the return what a wast..
0	My sister in law received one of these as a gift and she was elated.  She works long hours and is the go to answer person in her large real estate title company.  Shortly after she got it she called me and asked me to look at it and tell her what was wrong.  She had used the power pack several times and she could only charge her iPhone 4 about 50%.  She had borrowed one of my wife's larger power packs that could charge her phone 3  times.  She wanted to know why hers didn't work as well.This unit while cute is absolutely underpowered.  It claims to have 1900 mAh capacity but in reality that is not the real charging capacity of the device when you consider how it works.  The battery pack has internal electronics that consumes power the connector creates a contact that inserts some resistance and the iPhone has internal electronics in the charging circuit that consumes power and also drops the voltage from 5 VDC to 3.7 VDC to charge the internal battery of the iPhone. (more power lost)  The final efficiency of the charging is somewhere around 75% of the rated capacity.  This means that 75% EQUALS ONLY 1425 mAh capacity to charge an iPhone 4 that has a 1420 mAh Lithium Polymer battery cell.  That means that the likely hood of getting a full charge for your iPhone is about zero.Her experience was only a little over 50% and she returned it to the store it was purchased from.  I think you can see from the number of poor reviews and the new selling price that this product has some serious performance issues.  My recommendation is to buy a better power pack!
0	Do not buy
0	cheap crap. proof that sometimes You get what You pay for. cheap for a reason. some of the connection appeared to be broken. will only put about 15% back on to Your phone before it dies.
0	Incharged it and it only added 6% more to my battery and after that it wouldn't charge my phone. The little blue lights disappear as fast as they appear when charged.
0	Its really terrible.... I used it 3 times and it and only take my battery up 20 % and dies on me.... after the 3rd use I plugged it back into the charger that night and it wouldn't even charge anymore... its in the garbage now.. total waste of money.
0	Product does not work at all. I was very disappointed that this backup battery charger did not work at all.
0	This charger lasted about a week before it gave out.  From the time that i recieved it - it rattled as if something was loose and within the week you had to hold it to the phone in order for it to charge... Buyer beware.
0	Product looked as if it worked but did not .It does not hold a charge and serves no purpose without that acton it lights up but does not work
0	This won't charge an iPhone 4S running the latest software available right now. It flips back and forth between charging and Charging is not supported with this accessory finally settling on the latter.
0	I returned item because they didn't work they didn't work on my iPad or my iPhone  not a big deal got my money back
0	I didnt feel like trying to return this it didn't work and I was highly let down that it didn't work!
0	I plug it into my phone and nothing... its worked a few times but just turns off... it says its fully charged too....
0	It is very easy to see by the lights when the battery is fully charged.  These backup battery chargers are stackable when charging so I was happy that I had ordered four of them as they work very well.  This product works excellent with my iPhone 4.Update- 29 April 2013- While plugging in one of the batteries to recharge I heard a slight click and the charge portion apparently broke.  Not a chance of repairing so it went in the trash.  Buy with caution.  Because of this concern I have adjusted my rating from five stars to one star.
0	Horrible product.  It works to charge my phone about 50% for the first time then would not work after.  When you plug it in it says it is fully charged.  I even left it plugged in and it makes a somewhat loud buzzing sound.  I emailed the seller and since it was over 30 days they said I needed to contact the manufacturer.  Not even worth it!
0	Bought three of these.  2 of them died shortly after purchase.  The remaining 1 did live on but was difficult to use with an Otterbox case on the phone so I bought an adapter.  Then I decided to throw these in the recycle pile as the last one died in a few months with little to no use.  Waste of money and time.
0	this thing does not charge an iphone for crap. might work on a ipod but it def didnt work for my phone.
0	i bought it and it only worked for a few weeks and than it wouldnt even charge a bit. i try it many different ways but no luck.. not happy
0	This is not a good option if you want a little extra juice.  The picture doesn't show how clunky and cheap it is.  Go for one of the BatteryGen for 10-20 more dollars.
0	The unit said it was fully charged and it only charged the IPhone 10% before the battery unit lost power.Piece of Junk wasted 5 bucks.
0	when i received it i charged it up because i was going on a long trip. i was charging my phone in the car but this product only charged my phone to 15% from 0%
0	This backup battery is a big disappointment. I have very carefully tested the pack on different iPhones and an iPod Nano.  For an iPhone with approximately 30% full battery I am getting an incremental charge of 38% (i.e. 29% to 67%) in 60-70 minutes.The battery does recharge a fifth generation iPod in approximately 52 minutes.  Yet this pack was purchased specifically recharging an iPhone when traveling. Sadly the product will not work for my application.iPhone 4SDate: 4/21/2012minutes .... % battery .... lights0 .... 29% .... 420 .... 40% .... 330 .... 46% .... 236 .... 50% .... 245 .... 55% .... 255 .... 60% .... 260 .... 63% .... 266 .... 66% .... 168 .... 67% .... 0max-min  38%This shows minutes % charge on iPhone and the number of lights illuminated on the pack.
0	cheap. not good at all. doesn't hold juice for long probably gave an extra 5-10mins of power at most. not recommended
0	Hold s only a bid.
0	I didn't expect much for the price but I expected it to work. It only works if you  slide the battery charger into the item being charged and keep it pressed together with your hands. It should connect cleanly as other battery chargers do. It is more trouble to send it back than it is worth at the price paid.
0	I received a placement and still no luck with getting it to charge the phone mo than a few percentages after hooking it up no matter how long I charge the battery.
0	This product is totally far from what it is advertised to be. I purchased 2 of these and none of them really charges my phone 4s.  When i received this item I charged it for 8 hours.  I then plugged it into my iphone which was reading 25% battery life.  Within 7 minutes all 4 lights on the charger went dead and it only moved my battery reading to 28%.  I fully suspect that the charger is not 1900 mAH as advertised or it would have charged my iphone for much longer.
0	I've had these for a while and I can say that they are not even worth the seven bucks I paid for them.  They don't keep a charge and can never fit the ipod touch's connectors properly.  Also neither one works on the iphone 4s either.
0	Thank you for your good work in the Amazon and I bought a set of goods including the battery discovered that she was not working at all no not good so I want to retrieve Madfth in this item with best wishes
0	When charging it makes a loud buzzing noise. Does not fully charge a dead iPhone4. Cheap construction but I was expecting that for the price.
0	I bought one of these and it was defective. The seller apologized and immediately shipped out another one. So got the new one charged it up tested it out and it worked fine gave about an 80% charge. The way it is designed it can only safely be charged sitting safely on a table or desk try to charge it in your pocket or a moving car and you are likely to break your iPhone.I never really needed the backup just kept it on hand and charged up for an emergency (it will slowly lose its charge if not used).I lost electric power at home one day and I actually needed it. Although the lights indicated it was fully charged it took my phone from 19% charged to 26% then the phone switched to This device does not support charging. It does not work at all any more. This was an absolute waste of money for a false feeling of security. Do not buy this for an emergency backup like I did.
0	This product was garbage from the start I should've known better.Only 2 of 4 lights turned on and it charged my phone a whole 5%.I received a full refund immediately after filing a claim as if they knew it was a bad product and they did not even ask me to return the item. I'm going to just throw the thing out since its not even heavy enough to use as a paperweight or a doorstop.
0	Don't get. This breaks easy they do replace but now my wife doe not trust it. Abd Ann's I've egg roo
0	this item was horrible and it does not work on ipod touch 4g so dont buy it at all if u want a good charger go and spend like 20 bucks on one dont try to go so cheap becuase i found that out the hard way
0	Item stopped working after 3rd charge. I would not recommend this item since it fell short of performance claims in description.
0	As the saying goes you get what you pay for. This was an inexpensive product and it lived up to its name. This product does not do what it is supposed to and I'm glad I did not pay a lot for it. The charger will be fully charged when I attach it to charge up my iphone and before my iphone is fully charged the charger will go out. Useless product.
0	I expected it to be able to charge my phone up at least to 50%Doesn't and only charges well when battery is at at least 75% or above.If any lower it will get you to 15% maybe and that's even with the backup being full
0	This does not hold a charge worth anything and the charge it does hold runs out in a matter of minutes.
0	Most of these cheap items are what you pay for. They're the same at the $.99 store this never worked from day one it's not even have enough to be a paperweight.
0	a compete waste of money and expectations too small for apple category products. and untrustworthy. a completely meaningless item and shouldn't be admitted not amazon servers...
0	This didn't charge my phone more than 5%. Not worth anything!!!  It was cheap but save your money people! Rip off!
0	this product did not work. I contacted the sellers and follow their suggested actions but that didn't help. They offer a replacement product ONLY if i ship it back and they determined if it is a defective product. I didn't think it's worth the trouble for the few dollars i paid so ...
0	I CAN NOT EVEN USE IT TOO MUCH STATIC AND NOISE  EVERYONE THINKS MY PHONE IS JUNK BUT ITS THE EARPIECE. NO FIXING ONE OF THESE JUST KEEP TRYING TO GET A GOOD ONE????
0	I thought i'd work but it just never did. I'd like to return it i'll print up the return form and send it back.
0	With much anticipation I tried the Jawbone Icon eager to believe some of the rave reviews it has had.  What a disappointment.  The earhook is so flimsy that it came apart in the first 10 minutes.  I had not opted to use the earbud only (don't trust those - always scared it will come out of my ear) - and although I tried two different size buds as well as the earhook it was so loose that if I shook my head even slightly it came out.  The call sound was average - nothing to write home about but after 30 minutes of having to constantly keep pushing it back into my ear and reattach the ear hook I took it off and returned it.  WASTE OF TIME.  I am now trying the Plantronics Voyager Pro and have to say that for stability it is rock solid- it stays on my ear very well stays in place and the sound is like no other bluetooth I have had - even when driving it has loud good clear sound and people that I ask say they hear me very clearly and loudly.  This one is a KEEPER.
0	This was my second Jawbone and about the 5th headset I've owned.  The sound quality is terrible.  Really Jawbone?  The noise cancelling is far below that of the previous headset?  Really Jawbone?  The fit and comfort is excellent but it's so light it has a hard time touching the cheek which is required for good sound.  The switch is cheap and difficult to work.  No on-device volume control.  Being returned.
0	My Zagg Smartbuds fell apart repeatedly. Zagg's customer service offered me a discount on another pair but that's it. I've had to fix mine repeatedly. The last time they fell apart the button was lost. I like that they loop around the neck but the way that the mic/volume controls are set up is terrible because it falls apart. The plastic around the jack has also cracked. Never buying from Zagg again I don't recommend that you do either.
0	ALL of the provided sleeve sizes are big enough to plug an elephants butt! The volume is scaled way down and the buds are way to large for everyone in my house. They won't stay in place. Would never buy again!
0	My buddy swore by the Icon claiming it was the best noise canceling tooth he's ever owned. I took his advice and bought one. I absolutely hate this thing. Connection is hit or miss with my Samsung Galaxy smartphone. Sometimes I turn it on and it connects right away and sometimes I have to re-connect it by going into the phones bluetooth settings and pair it up. there are 2 tiny pinhole microphones on the side of the Icon but they will not pick up your voice if the little rubber nub on the bottom of the device doesn't touch your face (MAJOR FLAW). 50% of my calls with this are fine but if the little rubber nub pulls away from my skin by just a tiny bit then the person on the other end won't hear me or they'll tell me that I sound very far away.  This happens about half the time using the piece making it completely useless for me. I can't risk loosing clients because they can't hear me.The device has some positive aspects and I don't want to overlook them. It is very lightweight the standby and talk times are good but I've had other bluetooth headsets that have lasted 1-2 hours longer. It charges very quickly. There are multiple ear pieces that come with it so that you can customize the fit (though non of them keep the rubber nub to my face very well). The sound quality on my end is very good and I can hear the other people talking to me crystal clear.If you are overweight and have fat cheeks you might have better luck keeping this device pressed to your skin and it might work well for you. My face is pretty sculpted so it is basically useless for me and only stays pressed on my face 20-30% of the time.  I tried for 3 months to get it to work right and finally called up Jawbone to see if i could trade it. They had some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. They told me that if I didn't buy it directly from them they wouldn't do anything for me. They also said I would only be able to trade it within 60 days of purchase even if I had bought it directly from them.  Plantronics would go above and beyond to help their customers but Jawbone falls far short in customer service.  I recently bought another bluetooth device from Jabra. I will never buy another jawbone again.
0	i brought 3 of those but all tops are broken it`s a good case but the tops lasted two months
0	You wont have an issue if you purchase the Morphie. All these mom and pop brand names that just come out and make something out of junk material is an insult.
0	The connection started getting bad and I had to constantly wiggle the wires to get it to work. Then one day the cord came completely out of the part that goes into your phone.
0	THIS THING SUCKS SO BAD WHEN EVER I WOULD PLUG IT INTO MY MACBOOK MY COMPUTER WOULD TOTALLY RESTART AT FIRST I DIDNT KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS THEN I TOOK THIS CHARGER OUT AND SAW IT ONLY HAPPENED WHEN I TOOK THIS OUT AND PUT IT BACK IN DO NOT BUY!
0	Broke on the first use. I took the cable out of the wrapping and plugged it in to a usb port went to plug it into my iPhone and the end broke.
0	Did not charge my iPad. Ended up going to Apple store paying a fortune but bought a product that worked. Lesson learned-DO NOT LOOSE ORIGINAL that comes with it. Don't let kids borrow seems to disappear. I would NOT recommend this cord. Cheap but didn't work!
0	This cable doesn't charge well at all. It puts in maybe half of what I get from my Apple cable. It's not Apple.
0	You get what you pay for. This product caused problems with my ability to charge my iPhone and I actually had to replace the phone. Its better to pay the additional $30 to buy the Apple brand!
0	Very cheaply made and does not work at all with an iPad3.  Occasionally will charge an iPhone4 but it is not consistent. Would not recommend for purchase.
0	The instructions on back do not indicate which removable film to remove first. They are numbered (1) and (2) leading one to believe they should be removed in that order.  BOTH say remove before application.  But anyone who has experience applying these films will know you pull off the 'backing' film first and use the second one to help place the film and after application pull off the 'top' film to expose the final surface.  That didn't work here.  I think the numbers were backward.  This resulted in me putting the film down sticky side up which caused bubbles.  By the time I rectified this and flipped it was now impossible to get a nice application done.The company needs to revise its documentation and probably supply a nice card to help with application and bubble removal.  I used a credit card but it didn't work as well as Boxwave protectors.These just feel cheap bubbly and generally not good.
0	I couldn't get this to go on my phone right with out some kind of dust so I just gave up. Left bubbles under film.
0	very poor quality.. i got one of these around 2 months ago and now it is not working. I oly use it on the weekends when all my kids are togehter on the car and we need to charge multiple gadgets They should give a refund for such a poor quality item.
0	I ordered a dual port car charger. I received a single port one.
0	This will charge I pod and I phone but not your iPad. Has the same rating as the oem wall wart from apple so that's why I give it a negative review. Like I said though you can keep your friends happy if they have an iPhone cause they can charge theirs too. For that I give it 3 stars. Product seems cheaply made though. Hey ya git what ya pay for.......
0	I ordered two of these chargers. One for myself and one for my daugther. One works the other doesn't. So there is a 50/50% chance you will get one that works. However it wasn't very expensive.
0	I initially liked this and after only a few uses it simply failed. I did return it and the company did take care of it. I think this was a less then quality construction.
0	first off the design is obnoxious adn its very bad quality.  its cheap as hell....DO NOT PUT ON YOUR PHONE as it is litterally IMPOSSIBLE to take off the damn thing.  the fitting sucks for this like it wasnt measured correctly or anything....its crap
0	I bought this for my wife's aunt she had this 3 days and it cracked she is not hard on her phone this is just made of very cheap plastic I would look for a different case.
0	I ordered the item to fix my itouch but the screen was already cracked and it didnt come w/accecories to put it on and i am really frustrated.
0	When I did the search for accessories for my Behold II this head set popped up. But it doesn't fit my phone.
0	do not spend your mooney headset did not work at all waste of time and money no matter how much it cost save your money
0	This battery appears to be used -- visible scratches and marks on the terminals. Moreover I haven't yet been able to get the battery to work in the phone. The description is somewhat deceptive as the purchaser assumes it is a new product.
0	ITS A DAY LATE IM REALLY MAD I GOT THIS LAST MONTH AN I STILL DONT HAVE IT IT WAS DUE ON 9/11/12 AN ITS THE 12 AN STILL NOT HERE
0	I bought it on a whim to replace my old phone battery. It doesn't have a charge it seems. Don't know if my phone is rejecting it or the battery is not made for this phone.
0	I bought 3 of these. They support 4-5 hours of standby charge and perhaps 45 minutes of conversation. This is NOT the OEM battery. It may be helpful to note that original Motorola batteries have a don't open icon on battery front (a circle with a cross made of a screwdriver and a line) located diagonally from the BP6X designation. Presence of this icon does not a guarantee the battery is OEM but its absence guarantees it is a knockoff.All knockoff bateries I bought for my two Droids were similar. You get what you paid for.
0	i  tried  to  cancel  this  order  the  day  I  made  it  because  I  did  not  read  the  reviews  I  have  regretted  not  doing  so  ever  since  I  do  not  know  whether  to  blame  the  seller  or  the maker  therefore  I  blame  both  stay  away  from  this...they  are  probably  used  or  damaged
0	Got this an it did not work for me at ALL!!! I tried to charge it but it won't work
0	At times it does not connect to my phone properly. When I'm using it the person on the other end can't hear me well. I find myself screaming half the times.
0	Arrived in a plastic bag. Looked a little beat up. Not confident that it was actually new. Would not recommend.In addition the ear piece is too large for my ear. Cannot wear comfortably.Price was right but I wish I had bought one in person that I could touch before buying.
0	I really hate to write nasty reviews but I have owned a lot of bluetooth headsets due to my job keeping me on the road and I need to stay hands free.  I am on the phone often with clients and it is important to have a good call quality and noise cancellation is one of the best ways to get that.This head set is horrible at noise cancellation.  If you want to just sit on a sofa and talk it may be ok but if you are driving it it the worse.  It picks up the roar of any background noise. my Platronics broke so I picked up this one (which was my spare) and used it just for today and only talked to my husband and one other.  Both said they could not hear me for the roar in the background.  I deal with seniors (65+) so this is totally unacceptable.  I do not recommend this headset to anyone.  even though it is a cheap model....this is one time you get what you pay for.  Buy the Plantronics Voyager Pro HDLittle more expensive but worth every penny!!!!!!
0	What a piece of garbage. I had this item replaced twice before giving up. Mind you I received excellent customer service from the seller but the product just didn't work. The first part I received was just awful it was covered in some sort of syrup it was obviously used and even had bite marks that looked to be from a very small dog or rodent. I'm not exaggerating. I cleaned the part up with some iso and it looked pretty good (except the bite marks). It passed a preliminary bench test so I went ahead with the install. I wasn't surprised that the part didn't work and I contacted the seller. They were great sent out a new part the next day and this was wrapped in plastic arrived in pristine condition exactly what I expected the first time. No luck item wasn't recognized by iTunes I could charge the phone and even that was spotty. Sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't. I could deal with it not working on iTunes with iOS 5 I can transfer wirelessly but since it won't charge the phone anymore I am at a complete loss. Absolute garbage product buyer beware!
0	Find another one save your money and time installing this and then uninstalling it because your iPhone will sound like a toy phone in a tin can.
0	It went out the 2nd day of using it I thought my iPod didn't charge up but it was the LCD
0	Bought one - didn't work - returned it and bought another. Worked but very poorly. Never seemed to get a full charge. Save your money.
0	I was very happy to receive this product as I had added a Skinit picture on the phone and wanted this to add more protection for the phone. By the second day the grips started breaking off and now it is existing on two clamps at the bottom.  the rest of the hard shell does not stay closed. I did not get a week of good service from it!!
0	Boo-hoo better off with the 9780 camera's better and just seems to work better overall in all ways. Still a good purchase though.
0	They are used cell phones. They go fooling everyone. Do not buy it's a mess. I wish I had read the reviews before buying. I cheated and deceived
0	This chipped the corner of my phone and the whole thing chipped paint in a matter of weeks. Awful I threw it away.
0	This cover did not fit my Verizon iphone. It was impossible to charge the iphone with the cover on because the plastic cover was too small and the opening for the charger was not aligned with the charging dock. The case covered the flash. I am happy that Amazon refunded my money after I returned it.
0	Don't bother this thing doesn't fit right at all and feels like a cheap piece of crap. Color was nice that is all I have nice to say about it. I returned it for full refund.
0	JUNE 15 2010 UPDATE:BEWARE!!! After 2 months of use the cradle NO LONGER CHARGES THE PHONE!! I was so excited about this item but I quickly realized that Seidio must have rushed through quality and control on this item since others are having the same problem. Seidio needs to redesign and fix this problem! I would not buy this car kit if I were you!Initial Review in March of 2010:Yes this car kit is very good.  You can use it with or without a Seidio case.  There is an extra piece in the box to use if your Droid is not protected by a Seidio case.  Either way this is a nice car kit for the Motorola Droid but 50 dollars is alot for it.  I think 30 dollars is too much for this kit but I guess when there isn't anything else available the company can charge what they want.The kit easily attached to my windshield and does not move around.  There is plenty of AC cord to go from the AC plug to the car cradle.  My AC plug is located in the center console of my Camry so there is enough cord length to reach the cradle which I placed on the windshield to left side of the steering wheel.  Actually there is alot of cord left over so don't worry that you won't have enough cord to make this setup work in your car.  The cradle can mount in any direction and is easily adjustable even when securely attached to the windshield.  Being able to easily adjust the cradle while it is attached to the windshield is a bonus especially when the sun comes into play while driving.  I would not hesitate to purchase this car kit although I firmly feel the price should be lower.
0	The BN71 is not for a Barrage. We tried it in two. It didn't work in either phone said Invalid Battery. According to the Motorola website you want the BK71.
0	download anything you can to make this phone better after you buy it out the box it sucks i feel like this was the evo prototype evo is 100 times better but i hate sprint windows mobile is the worse software ever the harsware on this phone is great and could do so much better with something other then windows mobile no dont even think windows mobile 7 will be better never buy a windows phone i want to break my phone over the the heads of the people who made it
0	Have Android phone Galaxy S III. This unit did not work well with my phone. Low volume and no way to disable vocalist service.
0	Never worked.Received it in the mail plugged it in at home and just never worked.Plugged all kinds of different usb devices to it to see if it would work on some of them but never did.After trying for a while I decided to keep it plugged in with a device plugged to it.It ended up melting a little I immediately unplugged it and threw it away.Horrible product DO NOT PURCHASE.
0	Didn't work to charge 2 Samsung Galaxies.  I would return it but for $2 I'll just throw it in the garbage where it belongs.
0	This adapter makes high-pitched noise when I plug it in so I haven't really used it much for that reason.  I suggest going for a different brand and a different design as well.  There are nicer dual USB chargers than this and they're much more compact and won't block other outlets.  I'm glad I didn't pay much for this thing.
0	recieved a jabra c150 corded headset package when odering from HiLoPlace.  This included 6 eargels in the package.WARNING these are not a soft plastic they are medium desity at best.  Even the smallest would not fit into my ear.  They were hard.  The did not fit the Icon well at all even with the rubber in place.  I CAN NOT recommend these.  I will update with a link if I find a suitable alternative.
0	These eargels did nothing to help make my Jawbone headset fit better. My ears are just the wrong type for the Jawbone device with any of the eargels included or these purchased ones. These look like they came out of someone's ears as they are a nasty yellow earwax color.
0	Update: 4-21-2010Power of Reviews Trivia - on their TV commercial for this product they changed the amazon.com tag to bed bath and beyond of all things along with best buy.  I guess they don't want people to read these reviews!I've been living with this for a little over a week now.  At first it was a dream come true.  Then I found out that the battery needed a little top off with the factory charger.  After a while it wasn't just a little top off - it was a recharge.In fact It's hard to tell if there is really any charge going into the battery.  This was a great idea but the problem is it doesnt do the job.  I honestly believe most of the charging is comming from the brief and now overnight periods using the factory charger.More junk.  5 original stars become 1 as I take it back to frys
0	The phone is excellent brand samsung is very good but this tel although it does not bring anything of accessories and cable for data or headphones can not be set because it brings software at & t and this does not leave even upgrade anything said according to the report Samsung brings FM radio but this does not bring any of that do not recommend it.
0	This phone start having problems after the 1st 2 months which was not good for me or my daughter. this was a total waste of my money.
0	They took about 2 months to get delivered. That is the only reason I am giving these a 1 star otherwise I would give them a 5 star. The price is excellent and quality is great but they took so long that by the time we received them our phone was no longer working. You get 5 gel covers for an excellent price but they take forever to get delivered!
0	This one was a waste of money.
0	The cords were indeed the correct micro plug but are NOT OEM HTC. This caused an issue with the Otterbox case that is on my phone. I even Emailed the company right after my order to verify that the cords were HTC and never received a response.
0	This cable completely drained my battery.  My Evo would not respond at all - to anything.  When I plugged in to the stock charging cable provided with my Evo when I purchased it the charging light wouldn't even come on.  I had to go out and buy a new battery.  (So much for saving money.)
0	As many others have said these cables do not work for charging your phone. Cheap Chinese knockoffs. Data transfer works but no charging (although the phone reports that it is charging the meter doesn't go up) Tested on HTC EVO 4G and HTC Design 4G.
0	Hey my bad I should have paid attention to what company was shipping what.  I'd actually rate the phone higher it's not a total piece of junk but when you are looking forward to one thing and get another kind of kills it. eh.
0	I Can't hear the caller properly. Sounds like caller is way off in a distance. Similar to being at one end of a long tunnel and the caller is at the other end. Actually wasn't Mioshi brand as advertised. Was sent only part of my order and what arrived was a Coco brand ? Never got the second one at all.
0	Great ideal but that is the only good thing I have to say for this product.  I tried to use it my grandkids tried it my geek son tried it we all came to the same conclusion...... don't work.  Calls break up badly and not way to solve the issue.  We tried it on about 5 different phones.
0	This was a terrible idea.  The sound quality was awful with delays.  We returned it right away.  Do not waste your money...
0	I was disappointed to find that I spent 30$ for an imitation  the cord is doesn't extend seems made from a low quality plastic and the speaker is extremely susceptible to the signal emitted by the phone and becomes really noise
0	I chose this handset to use with my wireless phone in the kitchen because the product description says that it blocks most of the radiation coming from the phone.  Unfortunately it has not worked out for me.Here's my experiences with the MoshiMoshi handset:PROS:1.  The handset has a nice heavy weight to it.  The finish is comfortable to hold.CONS:1.  The 3.5 connector does not fit my cell or wireless phones.  The adapter included in the box was for an Ipad (which I do not own) or a MAC (don't own this either).  So it took a trip to my local RadioShack and $7+ to get an adapter that would fit. Seems to me that a thoughtful gesture would be to include All the adapters that might be needed in the box.  Strike One.2.  When I did attach the headset to the phones (I tried it on three different phones) I found that the microphone portion of the headset did not work.  And no the phones were not on mute.  And yes I did push the on button.  Strike Two.3.  The instruction booklet states that the product is covered under a limited warranty and that if the trouble-shooting section of their website does not answer my problem to follow the instructions on the support page.  However the support page is not to be found.  Does not exist  Strike Three.The idea of a handset that prevents the radiation that occurs with the use of cell and wireless phones is great.  And if your handset works this might be a great product. Otherwise . . .
0	First day I had issues because the touch sensitive volume bar would constantly detect touch against my skin even through clothing. This meant constantly the thing's volume was going up and down unless it was pinned to a work shirt's front pocket facing outwards (two layers of cloth seemed to prevent accidental input.The location of the rewind/play/stop/fastforward buttons their size and shape made it very hard to click the right one without actually looking at the device. I think I skipped a song or podcast more almost every single time I wanted to just pause (VERY annoying with podcasts or while in the middle of a cool song in Pandora.)I would had still rated the thing 3 stars if it was not because about 3 weeks ago the thing broke down. I don't know if its no longer charging or if the power button broke just that it does not power on anymore (I have many charges to test with none work and all were working for my multiple android devices and tablets.) It barely worked for 2 months before just dying on me.Seriously recommend you look elsewhere.
0	HI I used to like how cool the headset looks i was always wondering why does it get bad reviews I cannot understand sony I really hate their products and I havent had a single Sony Ericsson product last a year on me maybe the newer ones  but this brand is dead and shouls stay dead.DOES NOT WANT TO TURN ON 2 WEEKS LIGHT USAGE.(no nothing dead). just like my old SE K810i that failed in everything in the end screen broke itself how? who knows. Better stay with my wired one.
0	Worked great for about a week than totally crapped out. Will charge when plugged in and indicates such but after unplugging will not turn on no matter what i do.  Stay away from this one or at least get the updated version.
0	Worked for a few months but got to a point where it wouldn't shut down.
0	By all means I was not expecting much considering the item was under $100. However I did expect it to work once I activated it. So much for that since the screen will not come back on. Getting ready to box it up and send it back the same day I received it. Smh
0	I used them with my new Android phone and the sound level slowly went down and now it's totally gone from one side. The mic didn't even worked from the very beginning. They fit you just ok and comfort level was good.
0	I got these based on the reviews. They came with three different sizes. I must have very weird ears because I cooldnt keep any of then in very good.  Secondly when I could keep them in it sounded like I was underwater constant swish swish swish and thirdly they cut out a lot during a conversation.. I had to wiggle the cord a lot I think there was a break in the cord somewhere.. I had it plugged in firmly to my iPhone so that wasn't it.  I am sending them back.
0	I needed a right angled cable for my Samsung epic 4g. The right angle cable is perfect because it doesn't cover the earphone jack. Once plugged in (not to loose or to tight) it gives you the standard pop up screen asking whether you what to charge/tether and something else I can't remember. I'm an over the road driver so I use an android app for real-time weather radar and this cable allows me to mount my phone on my dash and not worry about the stress on my phone port. I bought the second one for my wifes Epic 4g.Update: 6 months later both cables no longer work does not charge nor transfer data as before had to revert back to the factory provided cable.
0	what I received didn't match the picture shown for this item picture shows wide side and they are actually very narrow. picture shows very black skin  what I receive is a clear smoke color.This is becoming a real problem on Amazon that they don't seem to care about( I have complained several times) and I am starting to buy lessonline as I can't trust what I will get is what what shown. For online shopping you only have the picture to go by and if you can trust that then the experience becomes a bad one. I know amazon will say you can ship it back and get a refund but for many items shipping it back and the time it would take to do is not worth it. Perhaps this is what Amazon and the sellers are counting on I stop shopping on Ebay for this reason.
0	OK so I bought a crystal clear case before this one and it was a little too hard. I wanted something to offer a little protection and make the Ipad easier to hold. Well this does neither. It makes it much more slippery think silicone baking sheet or a silpat. It fits so poorly and the sides are so weak if you accidentally grab it wrong on the side its going down. So while being cheap I thought it was worth a chance It wasn't. I will go back to my hard case least it fits.
0	I purchased this item based on many reviews.  I owned this item for about a year and i will not buy anything from this company again. The holder itself is ok. Its the vent clip and dash mount adhesive.  The clip was ok for about 3 month then broke off. One hot summer afternoon i got into the car and found dash mount on the floor  The adhesive simply came off due to heat.  VERY DISATISFIED.  I need to buy another one but not from AKRON....
0	Quite a let down.  The vent holder is horrible.  The windshield holder is ok but this thing is extremely bulky.  I cannot believe there are not better phone holders for the car.
0	The whole reason I purchased this model of car mount was because I wanted the ability to  mount it via the vent clips so I wouldn't have to permanently stick anything onto my dash which would 1. obstruct my vision of the road and 2. be a pain to remove - especially if I didn't end up liking the where I positioned it on my dash. It worked for about a week or so but on an extended road trip the vibration from the car ultimately made the vent clips &#34;weaken&#34; for lack of a better word and the clips to open which of course caused the whole thing to fall out of the vent. I thought I would just rubber binders to keep the clips closed but it was a pain in the rear to finagle them back onto the vent and it  ended up taking up so much space on the clip that it would no longer fully go onto the vent.Frustrated I ended up just attaching it to the section cup attachment and my phone (Samsung Note 3) is too heavy for it apparently or the suction cup is just poorly made but keeps coming unstuck after a day or 2. :(I would not recommend this product to anyone who has a heavy/bulky phone.
0	Do not get this...it will break on you in a heartbeat...I would NOT recommend this product.  It broke extremely quickly and the item is simply Cheap and not worth the purchase.
0	This is cheaply made. It broke after 1 week. Dont waste your money on this. You would be better off with something else.
0	Installed about two weeks ago took off and threw away today. I followed the instructions and took my time. Initially didn't look to bad. Kind of orange peel look and micro bubbles. All supposed to go away in a few days. I let the phone sit for 2 days after application before I used it. After 2 weeks the micro bubbles were still there and the screen side started coming loose in the corners. Also didn't like the rubbery feel of the screen. It also made the phone look really cheap. Ordered a scosche band edge and put it on afterwards. Keeps the screen from contacting surfaces where you lay your phone. I'll just need to be careful of the screen because these products a terrible.
