4	It charges all of our 2.0 usb devices like Galaxy Phones Tab notebooks and even some older phones. My only complaint is that the blue light is very bright at night so I have to angle it to avoid the glare. I like how long the cord is without putting any stress on my Galaxy S4
4	It charges pretty well.  I'm not sure if it's a rapid charger but it charges fast enough for what I need
4	I've owned quite a number of car chargers in my lifetime and have had minimal reliance on them.  This charger by far has been the best I've used.  Charges comparably as fast as wall chargers in my house for my Galaxy S3.
4	Perfect and works great! Still working after a lot of use. Seems to charge really fast! You can look down and see it's working by the blue light. At night it's no distraction either.
4	This is great it allows you to quickly replenish your cell battery while driving. I was abled to charge to 70 or more percent in just 30'ish minutes... Great product and good price.
4	I use this on my Nexus 4. It works and it is cheap. Do you need anything else? I think not.
4	I ordered this for my Droid X which I purchased about a week ago.  It arrived in the mail a few days later everything packaged neatly.Everything is pretty self-explanatory you just plug it into the cigarette lighter and into the phone.  It has a cool light ring near where you plug it into the lighter so you know it's working.A great value no need to spend all the $$$ at the Verizon Store (or any store for that matter).
4	This is by far the best charger i have owned.  I have used it for blackberrys droid x and have purchased multiple ones for each car that we have.  Don't buy any other one but this one..
4	Great for the price only complaint is that the whole center ring lights Up blue which is Very annoying at night.Edit was great when it worked now it's a no go. That's what I get for a eight dollar charger.
4	My favorite part of this charger is the big blue ring that lets me know it is properly attached to the lighter socket or my dual lighter sockets.  Other chargers have a tiny red light or a shaded red light that is hidden and many time it has slipped from the socket and thus my phones never charged.
4	It's a good charger it definitely does its job.  My only complaint (otherwise I'd have given 5 stars) is that it's a bit large with the unnecessary blue ring sticking out - this interferes with my cupholder.
4	This is my second charger of this type. The other one stopped working after a few years of being in the car. The charge is as fast as I have seen and the price is cheap so I ordered a replacement.
4	This is a good quality charger. The blue light matches my aftermarket interior lights so it looks pretty cool. I actually bought 2 of these for each car.
4	I bought the charger for my galaxy s2 phone and it works fine it charges the phone in less time than regular chargers I listened to reviews and bought the one from amazon itself not other sellers for authentication and it works fine even when I use the phone the battery is charging. Recommended.
4	It's cheap so I bought it. Just an extra charger for the car just in case. Works well. No issues yet.
4	There are obviously many good and positive reviews for this charger - I would believe them all.Note: I used the charger with a Galaxy Nexus phonePros:- bright blue light indicator - you always know when the phone is charging (something some of my previous chargers have not always been good at indicating particularly when they get rotated)- Fast charge time (not as fast as a home rapid charger but good speed)- cord clip the charger comes with a cord clip that does a fantastic job of providing enough play while preventing the cord from getting in the way. Easy to remove one end to allow an extended reach.- At first I did not like the underneath cord mount but it's utility is growing on me. This keeps the cord from getting in the way.- Price: competitive with generic chargers.Cons: the blue light is very bright at night but it is necessary to be visible during the daytime. (IMO this is not a big enough negative to remove a star)Extra Thoughts: I liked it some much I bought a second one for my wife (HTC Rezound)!
4	My one apprehension with this charger was its size. It looked large in pictures but the backlit clear window with the M logo looks so good I don't mind the size. Best of all is that the charger provides nearly a full amp (measured >950mA on several occasions) of charge. Very fast charger at a great price!Update: MicroUSB port wore out after almost two years. I can jiggle it around and get it to charge every now and then but for the most part it is finished.
4	This charger does the job and is a good value. Works fine with my HTC One. Would recommend and repurchase.
4	Super good especially for the price.  Some people complain about the glowing motorolla sign but I thought that was good so I can see that it is charging correctly.
4	I've bought a number of &#34;Budget&#34; car chargers in the past.  They meet the criteria of low cost but they usually fail on the important task of working&#34; every time.  This costs $2-$3 more than the cheapo models I've tried but it works everytime with every device and continues to work for more than a few months.I've used this in many different cars (some with notoriously troubled cig lighters like my buddy's BMW) and it always seems to work.  I like the &#34;lighted&#34; ring at the end that let's you know in all but the brightest light if it's working.  I also like that it put's out enough power to charge my phone while at the same time using the phone to stream music in my car.  Lastly I like that it works with all of the devices I've tried it with (Samsung S3 Droid 2 Samsung Mobile Hotspot and a few friends have charged their devices too).The first one I bought worked so well I went back and bought a couple more to keep in each of the family cars.  I may need to buy another one or two to keep in my suitcase / computer bag so I'll have one when I travel.  I believe I've had the first one for well over a year and still no problems with any of them.I wish everything was such a good value.
4	My Droid X tends to need a lot of charging and having this car charger handy is a life-saver.  It works great alone or with myMotorola Vehicle Dock for DROID X & Droid X2 with Rapid Car Charger (Motorola Retail Packaging). Good quality too!
4	Working without issue to charge Samsung Galaxy 3s. No issues thus far with two of these.Pleasant blue glow on the Motorola symbol but could be distracting while driving for some.
4	Motorola brand.  Cool blue to match civic console lights.  I like it and it hasn't failed me yet.  Get it to charge your devices today.
4	Do I need to say anything else? Save your time and effort buying cheap crap on ebay. This is the best deal you could get for 5 bucks!
4	great OEM Motorola charger that works great on my Samsung galaxy NOTE 2!!  wasn't 100% sure but i guess most MicroUSB plug chargers will work with others (you may want to dbl check output).  the blue LED isn't too bright nor bothersome.great car charger (and it's an OEM)!:)
4	This Vehicle Charger is a must  have.. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY faster than those generic charges you pay twice as much for. I ordered mine from Amazon LLC. be careful of the others in which may be selling variants of this Motorola charger.
4	Love this thing and I'm probably never going to buy another car charger as long as I live. Rapid and reliable. What more could you ask?
4	does the job. i bought this for my wife and she usually complains about these type items but i waited and not one peep so far and that's been over a month. awesome
4	I originally bought this for a Motorola phone and when I upgraded to a Samsung I decided to continue using it since the connector was the same. It worked perfectly. I've upgraded again and it continues to work. It is a rapid charger and I find that it does charge my phone more quickly than a regular charger. It has a sleek style and I like the blue light that glows when the charger is powered. I've bought these for my wife and two sons (and none of us have a Motorola phone). But what I love most is the PRICE (under $6 as of this review)!!! Verizon would charge me quadruple for a charger.[...]
4	and it seems to charge faster ive not timed anything but it seems faster i like the illumiated blue (M) built into the plug even if it is just for look  (ok its a power indicator) but its a flashy indicator. For the price i paid on amazon its a good item and Amazon has deffinately gotten better as of recently abou there shipping.. Im happy
4	Have been using it for some time and other than that it doesn't fit very well in my Honda's center console (it needs to be pushed in every once-in-a-while) I've never experienced an issue.
4	This charger is one of the fastest I have for my phone. Being a Micro B USB it will work with almost any smart phone. The spiral wound cord works well for the short distance in my car but still is long enough for the chasm of my old Ford Truck as well. The only drawback that I've come across is that bright blue LED that can light up the whole car at night. It's very distracting while driving and I strongly suggest rotating the charger so the light is away from the driver's eyes.
4	This charger works really well in fact it works perfectly with my Incredible. It arrived as an original Motorola charger and the company has wonderful customer service. Invest if you are looking.
4	Bought as a charger for my MIL's new phone. I went with this version since the cable is built-in and there could be no mix-ups with what cable to use and where/how to stick it since my MIL is not very tech-savvy. She loves it and it works very well on her phone. The blue LED is not too bright for night-driving yet bright enough to see in daytime so you know it's plugged in. My recommendation would be to get a USB car charger so you can use whatever cable you want and since you have two separate pieces if one fails you only have to replace that part not the whole thing. This however follows the K.I.S.S. principle and works very well. I would highly recommend.
4	does the job with a great price tag. with the other 1700+ reviews and most of them nearly 5 stars do you really have to look any further?
4	Even Motorola is no longer the major brand in the cellphone market their product is still worth to buy.  This charges has very pretty blue light and work very well to this day.
4	This charge was like 5 or 6 bucks. It was in perfect shape and gets the job done. Highly recommended!
4	Does exactly what its supposed to it charges things.  I have two of these and they work great. If I had to comment on any negatives I would say the led in the giant Motorola symbol is way to bright.
4	Having tried many 1 and 2 amp chargers from Scosche and been disappointed (my android used to discharge using navigation and Pandora) I decided to try this.It works!!!! Phone charges with everything on!
4	This power adapter is excellent. I use it for my cellphone and GPS. I even bought two more as a gift for my daughter and husband. Highly recommended.
4	I bought this charger for our LG Venice smart phone for Boost. Both ends plug in smoothly and the charger works well. We used the phone's GPS on a 10 hour drive to Georgia. We were able to keep the phone charged to 80% for the whole trip and kept the phone on to use the GPS.We also like the blue indicator light and the design of the charger that makes it easy to unplug from the car's outlet. This little gadget is quite the bargain.
4	Works perfectly! fits in well in my DroidX! has a well-lit end that you can see in the car. Only caution is that if your phone is in case protector then you may have trouble getting the charger all the way in depending on what kinda case you have.
4	I love this thing.  I haven't had much luck with wall chargers from Amazon but this charger is awesome!  charges my phone to 50% in about 3 mins.  Works well when you need a quick boost or to keep your phone charged.
4	I love this little adapter for my android phone. I love the cool blue light that lights up too. It charges my phone very efficiently. Couldn't beat the price either. Great product. And fast shipping as always.
4	It's a perfect car charger!  Cord is pretty heavy duty and never had any problems with charging anything with a micro usb!
4	I've almost lost count as to how many of these I've purchased already -- I normally keep two in each car to not only charge my HTC Sensation but my work Blackberry as well. I've purchased more to make sure I can plug them into rental cars (as I'm prone to forget things here and there) and keep my devices charged.It's a simple adapter with a glowing blue end - and does everything it has to!Make sure it's purchased from Amazon - too many other reviewers also complain about getting a knock-off product!
4	When I had to get a new phone I needed a different car charger. The store charged thirty five bucks so of course I said no. I knew Amazon would have it for cheaper and was I ever right. I paid a lot lot less with no shipping and handling. WHAT A DEAL!! Of course it works just as it should. I learned a long time ago to only buy Motorola accessories. The after-market companies products never seem to last. So if you're thinking about getting a car charger then I suggest getting this one. Even if you think you'll never need one for the price it's worth keeping one in the glove box for emergencies. (Do they still call them glove boxes?)
4	Clearly a well-made quality constructed charger - which is not something you can say for every aftermarket charger. I'm using it with a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works flawlessly.
4	The charger was a steal for the price I paid. It also lights a really cool blue once plugged into the vehicle cigratte lighter. The only fault is that it really doesn't rapid charge. The product was delivered on time and the transaction was smooth.
4	Have been using this  for 3 years now and it works great.  1st one last 3 years just bought a second one because i stepped on the connector.
4	Very nice i love it i take it every where i go and glad i bought it keep up the good work
4	This charger of course does it's job but it also looks great doing it.  When plugged into the cigarette lighter it lights up in a sky blue color that really glows at night.  I think it looks really cool and much more expensive than what I paid for it.  So far it has charged my phone quite well and almost as fast as the wall charger.  Would buy again and have recommended to friends.
4	This is second one I got for another car so I don't have to move it around.  The blue light works great because it tells you if it's been plugged in correctly (at least to the car battery).  This time I wish the cable is a little longer 'cause the outlet is further away.  If you need more than 24 inches you may want another choice because the coiled cable does not stretch well.
4	Good charger! I can't say it charges as fast as a home charger but it is still decent and enough to slowly charge even when using my phone as a gps and the screen on all the time. Some people may be annoyed by the blue light it doesn't bother me a bit.
4	Note that I purchased this charger directly from Amazon and not from one of the other shippers. After being pleased with the first one I tried to purchase 2 more but Amazon limited me to 1. I purchased the third charger from another shipper and I worry that it won't be authentic.I received this charger in a baggie containing a statement of Motorola warranty. On the underside of the charger the input/output electrical specifications were given in Spanish. So I think this product comes from a Spanish Motorola inventory. The electrical specifications clearly state an output current of 950mA at 4.75--5.25V. There is a plastic clip (visible in the picture) on onside of the coil that lets the coil fold in two. That helps keep cable management clean in the car.On my way to work this morning with my HTC Rezound smartphone initially charged to 90% I turned on navigation and left the screen on. The sun was out and so the phone became warm in its windshield mount. Nonetheless I arrived at work with the phone at 94% and starting to pulse its current draw to reduce incoming current. So the charger did its job nicely.So I am very happy with this charger. For under $6 it's a high-rate charger from a recognizable source.The low price and the fact that Amazon limits the number a single buyer can purchase makes me think that this charger will soon not be available for sale. Get it while you can. Nice unit (if you get the real version from Moto). Hopefully it lasts for a while.SIDE NOTE: If you are looking for a dual-output charger suitable for tablets I also have recently tried the Mediabridge High Output Dual USB Car Charger (3.1 Amp) and was pretty pleased with it. I didn't try it with tablets but it performed the same test as above with the same results (if not better) and so I'm pretty confident it really will deliver the 3.1A it promises if necessary (and certainly the 2.1A needed for a single tablet plugged in).
4	This was a great purchase. I highly recommend buying this car charger. Very fast shipment and it works great. It stay's in the car jack very well.
4	I bought this mostly because I like to listen to online radio in the car VIA my S3. I can listen to Pandora indefinitely in the car as this charger does a great job. It charges my phone to full while using it to listening to music while I drive. The charger has a soft blue light that tells you it has power. The connection to the phone clicks in securely and does not fall out under the weight of the cord.
4	This is the best.  Car. Charge by. Motorola. Tried. Several bought at tmobile and they don't last  very long..........................
4	This was my originall charger from like 6 years ago... since then I've had several both brand names and brand x chargers... I don't know what it is... but this charger charges faster than any other charger (even ones rated with the same high output).  I bought it again because it will charge almost as fast as the wall charger whereas even my samsung one seemed to only keep the batter yfrom going down.
4	This is a basic car charger. Works as it should no problem there at all. Plus it lights up blue which i really like. Not bad deal for the money.
4	Does what all these reviews have said. I use it on my motorola droid and it works great. Charges fast and has a nice pleasing glow to it. High quality!
4	Charges my phone while I drive. Cord is long enough to let phone rest in console.
4	very usefull adapter.  seems to be in tune with the charging system of my car in that it does not drain my battery excessively.
4	Charger works fast and without any problems that I can see. Great product! Both my wife's and my own car charger had died on us after a couple of years so I got two of these (both are official Motorola products)one for my wife's car and one for my own. I chose this model based on all of the positive reviews and the reviews were right on!
4	The best!! No other description needed. I have ordered seven of these. Five for myself and a couple for a friend. The only problem I've had is keeping them for myself. Borrowed one to a coworker and rather than return it he gave me a $10 bill instead. Another was stolen from my company vehicle. I keep one in every vehicle and one in my lunch box. Never had one fail or have had to wiggle the micro USB end to get it to work like all the el-cheapo ones I had before. For the price Amazon sells them you can order five of them and select Free Super Saver Shipping and it'll still be cheaper than going to a big box store or one of the carriers retail outlets where it'll cost you $30 for the same unit or anything comparable.
4	great price a great place of great place to do business with. That's it nothing else to say have a great summer
4	It looks great and functions as exactly as it should. No regrets with this purchase. I would buy this again.
4	Saw a charger at AT&T for $30 then saw this.  GET THIS ONE!  Save yourself money. Cool as it lights up too.  Use all the time.
4	Nothing compares for the price . If it fails throw it order another . Still ahead in $$$ compared to the pricey ones.
4	Nice sturdy construction. It charges my SGS3 as quickly as the plug-in home charger does. Even while I'm using my phone it will gain charge quickly! I'm very happy with this purchase!
4	I have had this charger for well over a year now and it is the best car charger I have had. Every other charger I have had has broke with in 3 months or less. This was a pleasant surprise. I have also owned several from my service provider and they broke almost instantly. I would highly recommend this item. Great value for the money.
4	I've ordered 10 of these things for my family and it's simply the best priced oem equivalent car charger out there.
4	Car chargers: one thing I really hate buying. I go into the cell phone store and they want a small fortune for one. If you purchase online you absolutely have no idea what you are getting. This charger is a diamond in the rough. It works great and charges my Droid 2 very quickly. It works so great I bought one for my wife. The blue light is a bit bright at night but nothing to take a star off. The light is low drawn power and it does not get hot at all so I just leave it plugged in all the time. Oh yeah it got here lightning quick too.
4	I've used a lot of very poor car chargers which were poorly made and broke quickly. This one surprised me. Very well made and the glowing Motorola logo is a cool touch.
4	I am using this device on my Samsung Fascinate:I liked my first one so much I ordered two more. One for each car and one to carry with me (I'm a professional driver and use lots of different vehicles).Fortunately the micro-USB interface is becoming quite common so this also charges my wifes phone and my bluetooth headset.As a bonus it clearly lights up to let you know when it is getting power.  This is very handy since not all vehicles give power when the vehicle is turned off.
4	Like my title says it's a car charger!  I like the blue light very cool!  But it does what it is supposed to.  No complaints.
4	it's a car charger. you can't get more basic than this. it's cheap. it's got a cool blue light. it works. 'nuff said. worth the purchase price. motorola makes fine gear.
4	For roughly the same price as the cheap chargers at Walmart I think this is a great buy. I use it for my Nexus 4 and it works perfectly fine. Charges quickly and the battery doesn't seem to be negatively impacted at all. I personally don't have an issue with the glowing blue light but others might especially when driving at night. I also like the coiled cord as it means I don't have a long cord hanging around my console. The charger itself feels high quality so it should last for quite some time. The only drawback I can see is that the charger is a bit longer than I would prefer but it's not a big deal. All in all it's a solid buy. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a sub $10 car charger.
4	Got this fit my wife's car. Do far it's worked great. No problems with it and it actually looks pottery cool when it's plugged in.
4	This is a Motorola product not a cheap Chinise special.  Well made and works perfect! Works on all brands not just Motorola.
4	Works great for my Android phone. Same color light as my car's dashboard. Works well and no issues. Worth the money.
4	Product is very well built best car charger is used been using other chargers but trashed them after using this product.elegant design and so premium.
4	Works great for my HTC Droid Incredible 2. I imagine it would work for any smartphone or gadget with a micro usb connection. This morning my phone was about 2/3 charged & this topped it off almost to full during my 10 minute commute. Impressive. It also has a compact atractive design and a cool blue light to let you know it's charging. The cord is not too short not too long and I like that it's coiled. Would be a great deal at twice the price.
4	This is a great product. I have several car chrgers and this one is my favorite. Especially the blue glow around the Motorola emblem. Ok I am weird but blue lights on anything make me happy.
4	I have used so many car chargers for micro usb devices.  Many cheap made in china chargers takes forever to charge the phone.  Some even do not fit well in socket and some I had to position the charger to charge the phone.  In some charger cord came off from base charger and or micro usb end.After I invested money in this it seems like solution of all problems.1. Durable cord which I believe that will be fine during cold winter.2. Durable connections to base charger and micro usb end.3. Cool blue lamp which indicates charger is well connected in power socket.4. No problem with connecting and charging any micro usb phone.I liked it so much that I ordered second one to replace it in my second car!
4	works great.. priced right I bought about 8 of them so i can just leave them were i need them.  long cord..  high quaility connectors that fit properly into phone..  only thing i dont like is the huge lighted logo its just too big and too bright.. but I fixed it with a sharpie..
4	This charger accomplishes what it aims to do (charge the phone) and looks pretty sweet doing so due to the blue lit center; however the charger piece sticks pretty far out of my cigarette lighter port and prevents me from putting drinks in the cup holder (2003 Honda Civic).With that being said do not let my 4 stars deter you from purchasing this product if you have ample space between your cigarette lighter and your cup holders
4	Works fine it's your standard OEM Motorola charger.  Bought it for an Android and Blackberry and it works for both .  That clear circle on the tip with the M logo is clear and lights up totally blue when plugged in which I find very cool!
4	I've purchased many (MANY) chargers over the years.  Most work some don't.  Motorola ALWAYS works.  Plus I trust it to deliver the right type of power to my devices.
4	Ir works great it looks neat just perfect. One reviewer didn't like the blue light that turns on when the device is in use - I actually think it looks great.
4	Overall this charger works great the MicroUSB fits well the cord is a perfect length and it's a high current charger so my Nexus One charges fast (and doesn't discharge while running the GPS).  I've purchased two of these now one for me (Nexus One) and one for my wife (HTC Aria).It lost 1 star because the plug part is _really long_ and the silly blue light.  It's actually quite bright and distracting at night I have to turn the thing sideways at just the right angle.  I could cover it if I needed to but turning it works.
4	I am very satisfied with the cost quality and timely delivery of this product. I like to have one in each vehicle and can afford it at this price.
4	On the plus side this charger is aesthetically pleasing to look at and does not look like a piece of junk stuck in the dash. I did expect a faster charging rate for my Motorola Bravo with this charger. For a rapid charger I have not found it to be very rapid in my environment. At least it will keep me going until I can get back to a socket while on the road and running low on charge.
4	It's only been a couple of months but it connects and charges perfect everytime for both my HTC EVO 3d and wifes EVO 4G. Considering buying a 2nd one because we have to share this one on long trips. Not a big deal but wish the cord was a little longer to reach back seat.
4	Thank goodness for whatever committee decided to standardize on the micro-usb connector for power on so many portable devices.  This power port adapter (power port formerly known as Princeoops I mean cigarette lighter) will charge both my phones and both my tablets.  I get a warm fuzzy feeling in knowing it is a Motorola device as I have had positive experiences with Motorola equipment.  To top it off it has a very cool blue light when it is charging.  So a free light show is included.  Nice charger at a very reasonable price.
4	Worked perfectly and fast on my Droid X.  The version I had from Verizon cost three times as much and didn't give me more than a 30% charge increase on a two hour drive.  This gave me 70% in about an hour and a half.
4	Google hasn't done a great job putting out accessories for its Nexus 4 phones.  Fortunately their approach of using a micro-USB cord means I have many choices for charging devices.  The awesome reviews on this product made me buy it without hesitation.  It came quickly and works like a charm.  I had read about the charging capacity and should have expected a quick recharge but it still surprised me.  The blue color looks neat in the dark too.  Win-win!
4	My favorite color is blue... but that is not why I bought this adapter.  Yes the Moto logo glows blue from the blue LED but I know that Moto makes quality chargers.  I buy Moto chargers no matter what brand of phone I use because I know that they will stand up to abuse. If you buy one buy several so that you can keep one in all of your cars in your briefcase your purse your backpack your desk drawer etc.  That way you are prepared no matter where you go.  Besides a coworker or friend will be whining one day about how their car charger died on them.  Imagine the smile when you hand over one of your prized Moto chargers and tell them to keep it.  Get them to buy you a cup of coffee or a can of your favorite soft drink.  :)
4	Good quality charger. It is made from a brittle plastic that breaks easily. It charges phone quickly. The center Motorola symbol glows blue so you know when you have it powered up. I have one in every car (3) I own and my truck.
4	This is my second charger like this (lost my first one... then found it the day this new replacement charger came in... figures).  Both have worked well with a Moto Droid X and Moto Droid Razr Maxx.  It charges just fine at about the same rate as the OEM stock charger so I assume it is around a 1A charger (probably just below 1A).  I don't care for the length of this thing; however it's worked better than other chargers I've had.
4	This USB charger really does work quicker than the one it replaced.  I'd bought a generic charger from Amazon some time ago and at some point it got crushed and broke apart.  The Motorola is just a bit bigger than most chargers but the glowy blue circle is easy to grip and doesn't get in the way of my gearshift which is actually a pretty important thing to know when you drive a stick.I've noticed it charges my Samsung Galaxy SIII fairly quickly--with it below 20% I might but close to the top in an hour or so.  The cord is long and the coiled nature even provides more stretch if you need it.
4	I serves the purpose but can be difficult to press into the charging slot of your car.  i recommend pressing the prongs down to make sure they fit.  Would not recommend for people who have trouble with grip.
4	I ordered this and was so surprised that it was so cheap and charged my EVO so fast.  My Pastor and his wife only had one charger so I gave him one and he loved it as well.  Of course I ordered a replacement for the one that I gave him because they work so great.
4	bought this charger to replace my 5 year old mini-usb charger from verizon. works well and the blue light up motorola insignia looks nice. you don't need to use this with motorola phones... you can use it with any phone that needs a mini-usb connection. the voltage might differ but it'll charge your phone. why pay $30-$40 in the store when you can buy it online at amazon for a much better price?
4	High quality charger appears to be genuine Motorola. Cool blue light. Plugs fit nice and firm. Cord is high quality as well. You should not expect OEM retail packaging though. These are coming in bulk (plastic bag) packaging. Can't complain one bit about that given the price. Why pay $20 for these in the store? Gotta love Amazon. Bought a case screen protector a car charger and an extra home charger for the price of one in-store charger!
4	I purchased this to charge my HTC EVO 3D when in the car. It works very well and is able to keep the unit powered and prevent the battery from draining when GPS is on and navigating. My previous car charger could not provide enough power to keep the battery from draining when using navigation. Could do without the blue light but not the end of the world.
4	Seems like I should not be excited about a charger but this one is great. The last charger I had just broke and it charged my S3 very slowly. This one feels solid and it chargers the phone almost as quick as a wall plug.  I like how it lights up too and that ring makes it easy to pull out. A good buy
4	The cheap car charger I bought from Ebay were causing electric leak and drain out car battery overnight also burn out the car fuse.After review all feedback about this charger I decide to give it a try so far it did not cause any more battery drain issue and work perfectly with my LG and HTC Thunderbold phone.
4	No problems. It charges my Motorola Droid without any problems. I would buy again. &#34;Six more words required.&#34; It's fine.
4	Very good product especially for its price! Looks real nice and charges real fast I'd defiantly but from you again
4	Great charger. Looks and works great for any phone using a micro usb charger. Charges phone pretty fast too. Id suggest it to anyone.
4	I use this for my Samsung Galaxy S3. It charges the phone very quickly.I like how it lights up blue when its plugged into my car correctly. The chord is quite long which is a nice bonus.Peace in the Middle East.
4	Its the same as the original car charger that comes with motorola phones. The cord is slightly annoying but works better than most car chargers so would definitely recommend
4	It works really well. Callers say I sound clear although they know they are on speaker even when the car is quiet.  I'm very happy with it.I like that if I forget to turn it on I can turn it on when my phone rings and it will answer the call after it powers up.I have a retractable usb cable connected to it all the time.  I have just under zero slack on the cable.  It's tucked behind the rear view mirror.  The cord is thin and barely noticeable.  Plus I can retract the cable away if I want a more elegant look with passengers in the car.I tried the music stream feature when I first got the unit and never tried it again. :-)  The sound isn't great so don't buy it for the music feature.
4	This is the 2nd bluetooth speakerphone that I've purchased for my car after also owning 4 bluetooth headsets. The headsets don't work for me. I previously owned a Parrot Minikit which worked reasonably well for over 3 years then suddenly died -- although it was working sound could be neither transmitted or heard through it's speaker. I purchased this unit after reading consistently positive reviews and got a killer price for an open box unit. Here's my thoughts: the sound quality is better than the Parrot on both ends. The Parrot has better volume with the built-in speaker but using the T505 over my car stereo is totally awesome. The battery life seems to be pretty good. I'm going right now on my 2nd week without a charge using it daily. Pairing is easy. The auto-pairing when powered off and on works quickly and without a hitch. The text-to-speech voice dialing which is really a function of the phone not the T505 is OK (I'm using an LG Env2). I usually dial out on the phone and receive calls using the T505. The control layout is pretty good and the indicator lights are actually useful. The manual is surprisingly well written. All in all I am pleased with this unit and would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality speakerphone for the car.
4	Wasn't sure what to expect with this but it works flawlessly and it is very easy to use as well as very portable.  Probably my only complaints are that you do have to read the manual very carefully to understand the various colors and blinks of the lights but once you know your way around it - the device just works.  Callers cannot tell you are on a bluetooth and you can hear the callers very clearly.  It has exceeded my expectations.  Plan to get another one for our second car now.
4	My wife is always very hard to shop for.For the holidays last year my wife 13 year old son and I all picked up new LG Dare's from Verizon and each an 8gb micro SD.  My wife and son love the music player aspect of the phone but the quality of the music is not great coming out of the phone itself.Come Valentine's day I was in the same boat again of not knowing what she would want.  I had already spent time on Verizon's web site thinking that I could find an accessory that she may want and stumbled across this.  After some time researching what this device was capable of - stereo bluetooth through your car stereo as well as utilizing the car stereo for mobile calls I thought that this would be not only cool but a safe way for my wife to talk on the phone while commuting.  A few searches later and I found a price that I could agree with and ordered.Upon receipt on the device I was impressed with the packaging and the prompt service of the vendor and couldn't wait for my wife to open it up.  When she did she was able to connect the phone to the device and start playing music through the stereo within minutes of getting to the car.  We also were able to figure out the answering a call and were pleasantly impressed with the quality of the call on both the receiving and sending ends.My qualm is that multiple devices can't be hooked up to it at once at least we haven't figured it out yet.  I understand the limitation but it would be neat if either of us could answer a call utilizing the car stereo when we travel together.I would like to pick up another one of these for me to have.
4	Just got this on 6/5/2011 - Great automotive Bluetooth FM transmitter for Music and Speaker Phone for my iPhone 3G. Charged it fully right out of the box and then started using it. My unit came with the car cigarette lighter charger and literature.  I used a standard mini-USB power charger that I had and that worked fine.  Car charger also works well. Sound quality is great for both phone calls and for music through the car stereo. Tonal quality is fine on the stock stereos in my cars. For a more critical listening test I set the FM transmitter for my Home Theater Surround System and the music sounds great on that also (good imaging and tonal quality). The unit appears to be durably constructed and should last.
4	I'm a grizzled veteran of the BT headset wars and I'm always changing to find the perfect headset.  This is the closest I've come so far.Here's the good:===========================* By far the best thing about it is the noise-cancelling feature. I'm on the road a lot and the max setting almost eliminates road and background noise on the other end...my daughter said she hated talking to me when I was on the road before I bought this headset. This is a MAJOR plus and the main reason I bought it to begin with. It simply works!* Volume is LOUD! In those noisy environments this is a plus and I usually have to turn it down to mid-range even in noisy areas.* Unlike some it is very comfortable to me for long periods of time and I wear mine for hours at a time. Lighweight and small...compared to my Motorola H700 it's heaven. I forget it's even on sometimes.* I love the quick disconnect reconnect feature using the volume up/down buttons.  I use it with two phones (Motorola V325 for work and Blackberry 8700c for personal) and this makes it a breeze to switch from one to the other without having to fumble through the phone menus. (If you use it with a Blackberry be sure to turn off the Echo Control setting in the BT menu for this headset.)* Clip for your shirt or pocket.* The price is very reasonable for a headset with these advanced features.So what kept it from being 5-stars?=====================================* Proprietary charger (why not mini-USB except to make more money?)* Slippery plastic ear hook though they do include extras.* Talk time is okay but not great. I can get maybe 4-5 hours out of it putting it squarely in the average range based on my experiences.But these are minor nitpicking complaints.  Overall I would recommend this to anyone who wants a small lightweight comfortable noise-reducing headset.
4	I have tried almost every brand of Bluetooth Headset on the market but have not found one that meets my requirements until now. The Blueant Z9 is extremely lightweight and small. This makes it very comfortable feels secure and does not flop around. The sound is loud enough that you do not have to increase the volume. The voice quality is clear and consistent. I have it paired with a Nokia 6555.Now for some details. The Jawbone is by far the best for handling noise cancellation. However the voice would sometimes be garbled or breakup. The Z9 does a good job on noise cancellation and the voice stays clear and does not breakup.There are three buttons. The function button handles most features. There are two volume buttons for up and down. The volume buttons also have functions such as holding down the volume up button for three seconds actives the redial feature. This may sound confusing but it really is not. You just need to read the instructions. The buttons are easy to press with little resistance.The Z9 has a large speaker so there was no need in the design for an ear bud that directs the sound into the ear. It also has two microphones that help improve voice quality for the person you are talking too.The noise cancellation defaults at minimum. In noisy environments simply click the function button. A voice tells you that it is set to maximum noise cancellation. That is really a cool feature because you do not have to figure out what the beeps mean.The range is as advertised. I walked away from my phone by about thirty feet and still had a clear connection. Therefore you do not have to place the headset on the same side or close to your phone.I looked at my phones paired devices and noticed I had firmware version 3.1. I went to the Blueant site and downloaded the instructions and installation program for firmware version 3.4. I could not get the installation to work so I called tech support. He told me that the instructions online were for Windows XP and I had Vista. He said that they have not posted the instructions for Vista online yet. He promptly emailed me the Vista instructions. They were detailed and precise. I upgraded the firmware within a few minutes without any problem.Helpful hint: To get the best sound qualities speak in a normal voice not too loud. In addition update the firmware to the latest version.I highly recommend you try this headset for yourself.Update: I have read that the ear hook is made of stiff plastic that cannot be bent. This is not entirely true. If you want a tighter and more secure fit then do the following. While holding the hook in the bent position you want hold a hot hairdryer about two inches from it for about five seconds. The hook will stay in that bent position. Just be careful not to bend it too far or the hairdryer is too hot or too close to the hook. I did this with my hook and it fits much better even with my glasses on.
4	Ok for the purpose of full disclosure the negatives first. The earpiece needs work - BlueAnt can take lessons from Plantronics there. The earpiece unthreaded itself and disappeared within the first week or so. Good news is that I called BlueAnt and they mailed me a replacement the same day. No charge :)More good news - I discovered that one of my old Jabra gelcaps fits really well and it's more comfortable to wear than the official earpiece.This headset is the only one I've owned (5th one) that my mother had no complaints about hearing me. The acid test for clarity is my mom - and the BlueAnt passed.It doesn't do well with wind noise but not a single bluetooth does. One thing I love about this headset is that its firmware is upgradeable. I've already done it (with a few hiccups but BlueAnt's technical support is superb).I was at the Seahawks game and talked with my wife on the headset - she could hear me clearly (although it was so noisy I had a difficult time hearing her). I switched it to voice isolation max while I was pulling some noisy toters over rough asphalt while speaking with a friend and was told that my voice was totally clear.Here's the clincher - shortly after I got the BlueAnt I was speaking with one of my consultants. I asked him if he could hear me OK because I was using a new bluetooth. He couldn't believe that I was using a headset asked me what I was using and ordered a BlueAnt immediately!
4	The BlueAnt Z9 is everything it claims to be. Its easy to use and is very clear on both ends of the conversation. This is the first headset I have owned both corded and cordless that sounds nearly as good as a land line. The battery life is amazing. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
4	This is the first BT ear piece I have had that actually works the way it should.  Very light fits in the ear well and after a couple of days I almost forgot I have it on.  Some people complain about the unusually long button hold to end a call but I have not had a problem with it.  Battery life is excellent.  Not as good in the wind as I had hoped but this is true of most BT ear pieces I have tried.  In the car works like a champ.Be sure you check the firmware version and upgrade to the latest.  The one I received was 2 releases behind.  This feature alone is worth the price!
4	Product works as advertised. Easy to use superb sound quality and a great buy to boot.
4	I am a tech-saavy first-time owner of a Bluetooth headset.So far the Z9 has been great.Pros:*Works with my cellphone's voice recognition so I press one button and say Call SoAndSo.  I *LOVE* this feature.*Easy re-pairing after On/Off cycle*Decent battery life (I use my cell phone ~6 times daily and it lasts 2 days)*Fits VERY SECURELY in my ear.Cons:*I've noticed a few times when the sound/mic stopped mid-call after about 30 mins.  Maybe I need a firmware update.*Other party can't hear me well with wind or background noise even with the Enhance voice feature. But I can't imagine that many other devices perform much better*Learning curve. There are 3 buttons and with them I can perform 20 functions.  There is 1 led light which represents 6 status indications.  It'll take some time before I know all of them but the basic ones are very easy to learn.
4	I'd used Blueant products for at least 3 years before I lost my device. I tried to wait it out in hopes to find it and I did... It had been ran over in a parking lot I knew right away that I would continue to used Blueant products because of my great experience in thepast. THIS PRODUCT IS VERY USER FRIENDLY AND GREAT FOR WORK.I even purchased one for a friend!Thanks!
4	I've been using a cellphone for a long time and have used lots of corded headsets with varying results.  I had a few bad experiences with Bluetooth early on and felt that it just wasn't ready for the prime time.  A friend got an older Jabra headset and it was terrible to talk on--static breaking up muddy speech--I basically REFUSED to talk to him while using it.So it was not without trepidation that I pulled trigger on this little fella.  I am impressed!  The highest praise I can give is to say: IT. JUST. WORKS.  You take it out charge it and pair it with your phone (Palm Centro no problem at all).  In seconds I was using it and it sounded GREAT.  Both my wife (an occasional Luddite) and good friend said that it was actually BETTER than when I was talking on the handset regularly.  What more can you say?Very comfortable to wear the buttons are easy and intuitive to press and it seems sturdy (in part because it is so light I dropped it but was not worried at all).  Yes it is a little confusing to know when to click a button and when to hold a button for 3 seconds and which combinations you need to press but for the basic functions it's pretty straightforward and only for fancier things do you need to memorize (or look up in the handy guide) the buttons to press.What about background noise?  It did a nice job on a windy Boston day and when you which to maximum voice isolation it does a remarkable job with cutting out background noise and music.In sum this is a remarkable headset.  It is small light affordable and really does the job.  With a 2 year warranty and upgradable firmware (mine came with 3.4 the newest available) I'd say it is a pretty sweet device and worth picking up.
4	This is easily the best bluetooth headset I've used. I use a cell phone in my home office all day and I need a headset that sounds very natural and as close to a land line sound as possible. This one delivers that with very clear sound on both ends.  It's also the lightest one I've used and it's very easy to wear it all day without discomfort. It also doesn't drop connections with the phone (a blackberry).  I've used a jawbone (sounds like it's a shortwave radio transmission) nokia bh-900 (clear but very uncomfortable for all day use) and a half dozen others in the last few years and the others don't come close.  I also like that it comes with additional ear loops but I doubt I'll need them since the earloop seems sturdier that the little wire loops most headsets come with and I won't be carrying it in my pocket due to discomfort.Buy this one you'll love it.
4	Bought these about 3 years ago for about $150.00 from Radio Shack so now the price is right.  No problems so far and small size is ideal.
4	Very lightweight good sound quality. Holds a charge pretty well. The sound isolation feature works pretty well... one setting or the other generally works unless I'm in the open in high wind.
4	This is a fantastic headset for use with a single device (phone laptop/Skype etc.).  It is better than all the others I tried both in fit and sound quality.If you have a high need for switching between multiple devices however be aware that the advertised on the fly switching between up to 3 devices does not really work very well.The major shortcoming is that you have to completely turn off the current device (or its bluetooth radio) before you can switch to another device.  This makes no sense at all since the Z9 has a button control for disconnecting from current device.Depending on your setup this can range from a nuisance to a major roadblock.  For example my setup is to use the Z9 with my laptop for Skype calls and my Blackberry for other calls.  I may switch back and forth regularly depending on who I am calling.If I want to switch from cell phone to laptop I have to complete turn off the cell phone bluetooth radio which means the Blackberry loses all of its blutooth connections (including bluetooth synching to PC and modem use).  If I want to switch from laptop to Blackberry I have to either turn off my entire laptop (it doesn't have a bluetooth radio off option) or remove the Z9 device from the bluetooth profile completely which means I have to reinstall it from scratch again the next time.There is a new version called the Z9i which claims to have better/more options for multiple devices.  I don't know if this limitation about having to turn off the current device has been fixed however.
4	They came on time and they come in handy. I bought them bundled with a Pack of 12pcs Dust Proof Dust Plug iPhone Speaker Plug Plugy - Black and they go well together I have connected a stylus on it to go with my tablet so my stylus is always with my tablet.
4	I got these for crafts but never used them.at least when I do I'll be looking good white these colors
4	I was nervous the cord would be cheap and break easily. I have not been able to break one of these yet.  However the metal ring is a different story. If you pull hard enough they will open up. I switched some of the rings out for tiny key chain rings.
4	Very handy item for when your stylus is not in and when your earphones are not in.  Keeps the dust away for sure.
4	This is a great item thumb drives now a days don't come with these straps anymore I needed plenty. So far no problems. Only time will tell how long these will last but so far so good.
4	I purchased a bunch of tiny 16GB USB flash drives to give away.  Since they are so small I was afraid that they may be easily lost or misplaced.  With that in mind I bought these straps to hold them down and possibly keep them in a key ring.  These little straps are easy to install and holds the USB flash drives tight.  For a pack of 10 they are quite affordable.
4	Very strong and durable cell phone straps. Have used them for our charms we got to put on our electronics to help us decipher whose toy was whose on our gaming party nights. Distributed them out to friends and neighbors and they have all withstood all types of abuse. Seller great with shipping seeing how far they had to travel. :)
4	I don't know when the person received their order who said that the product didn't have split rings but I received mine in Aug. 2013 and they did have split rings.  I've just received them so I don't know how they will hold up but they look the same as any other product of this type.  My only complaint is that they came from China and it took two weeks for delivery.
4	Less than a dollar for 10 of these. They are cheap but useful for attaching to small drives so they are easier to find. Can't go wrong for less than a buck including postage.
4	when you have plug adapters for smartphones it is better to have many plugs and straps for your charms so that changing them is just change the plug and it takes just one second. It is very practical
4	I purchased these to use with a micro-USB flash drive so I could easily pull it out of my machine.It works for that purpose but they are very small strings and the rings are very tiny.i'm not sure what else you would use it for -- I couldn't find any other uses for the 9 other pieces that came with the deal.Its ultra cheap and fit for purpose if you have something small with a very small diameter hole that you want to attach a small strap to.
4	These split ring straps worked perfectly for attaching my mini USB drive to my keychain. They probably wouldn't be strong enough to hold a cellphone or camera but they are literally perfect for holding a USB.
4	It took little while to receive them from supplier. When I got them probably with in a week time I found ten devices to use these. Its been several months and they seem to be holding up during regular use.
4	They will do for the little projects that I have to come for them and the length of the straps are perfect and the fact that its 10 for about $1 even better!
4	For the price I can't complain.  I've used some of these for my club cards ( you know... the discount cards for places like CVS Walgreens etc).
4	HAHAHA...LOL-OL-OL...there are 35 reviews of a $.84 bag of straps! well i am the 36th time-well-spent reviewer LOL! Sorry people and seriously who cares to know if these straps can hall a 4x8 trailer (haha)... You have 10 tries and if all fail just buy another bag of them! I also am buying a bunch of tiny usb's as gifts for xmas and ran into these with comments and spent 15 mins with it LOL! Merry xmas to all!
4	It took a little more than two weeks for these to come in. The rings are split and it looks exactly like the picture. The count also says ten but I got sixteen. (: The split rings are a little thin but they are good for their price.
4	product works well with my charms.  it is very durable as well.  the size is perfect for what i intend to us it for.
4	I have numerous amount of USB thumb drives which all have the little loop on them. However do to cost cutting they don't come with them any longer. So I decided to purchase some for myself. I have a USB drive that is thumb nail size. This one has the smallest loop of them all but with the help of a paperclip i was able to get the strap in. This allows me to remove the drive from my PC with little trouble. They are not too long about 2 inches so they are the perfect size The price for 10 wasn't much more than the price for 1 so it made sense and I have extra in case one breaks.Though the scheduled arrival date was a few weeks back from what I wanted but it did come within that time without an issue. All 10 appear to be in good shape and are not damaged upon arrival. They came in a small clear zip bag within a large shipping envelope.
4	I used this strap to connect the stylus to the dust plug and it works great! It was also a super price.
4	The material and craftsmanship while poor performs adequately well and is of a more than reasonable price. With a generic strap cheap split ring and cap much to my surprise that the lobster clasps just by themselves are worth the price. I recently just bought 10 lobster clasps for $4-ish and were of terrible quality. Just pulling on the lever would risk breaking the entire thing. For half the price I got much better set of clasps as well as the bonus of the straps I needed.Going by the picture and description I did not expect these clasps to come-with so I'm not only satisfied but just very may buy another 10.I used the straps to string charms to my PSP and 3DS.
4	These straps are exactly as I expected.  I don't know how some of the reviewers expected them to hold a cell phone.  They don't look like they are that big in the photo unless the photo has changed since their reviews.The cords are small perfect for the tiny electronic locator I put on my keychain.  They're also a good  size for the charms that go on cell phones or for small thumb drives.Another inconsistency: maybe different vendors provided different straps but the ones I received have split rings.  They look sturdy enough.  So far I have no complaints.This was a good value.  I'm impressed and would buy them again but that won't be for a long while.  I only needed one cord.  I now have ten.
4	They are great and very easy to use. I put them on my mini cork bottle charms. I wish the strings were a bit longer but they work just fine. I got it not too long after I ordered it. They were cheap too.
4	I bought these strap for the USB sticks so I won't lose them. Really tiny straps. I was expecting it to be a little bigger. Pretty happy with it.
4	Great all around lanyards for anything which needs to be keep close. I will be buying more for friends and family.
4	These are put together nice and tight so you don't have to worry about losing whateve charm you have on the end of it. Would recommend using these for your cell phone charms.
4	Whether you buy the ear-jack plugs or use the loop on whatever you're using this strap for it's def a good use to make charms to fit on your phone!
4	some USB flash drives.  I got this for my elago micro drive since it has a cut out for one but didn't come with a lanyard.
4	I use this not for cell phone  i use this for put some gadgets for camping and works great for me!
4	Work greats for my cell phone charms the only down fall is that the jump rings break easy would be five stars if they had split rings instead still worth money will order more
4	I love the callpod chargepod which is a round hub with 6 spokes of chargers sticking out of it. I have not found a single one my my rechargable electronics for which there is no callpod adapter. I felt that the default adapter's included with the callpod were not the best choice. So before purchasing a callpod make sure you count the cost of all of the spokes that you will purchase; they usually will cost you between seven and ten bucks apiece. But for me that is worth it. So this version of the callpod allowing you to purchase just the base and then purchase adapter's separately is the best route to go in my opinion.My life is a tangle of cords and the callpod chargepod works to fix that. I keep my six devices (usually two blackberries an ipod two bluetooth headsets and an Amazon Kindle) charging in a self-contained circle without cords going everywhere and without the use of a powerstrip. Then when I travel I can connect those same device to the car charger using the car power adapter. And in a hotel room I can charge all my devices (including any that charge via usb using the usb adapter) without bringing tons of cords. The callpod is an expensive yet for many worthwhile accessory for your portable electronics.
4	True this charger will charge multiple devices but...1. Individual cables are not labeled as to what device they are for.2. The charger lights do not go out when the device is charged.  I can see how you might overcharge some devices because there is no automatic circuit that detects when the battery is fully charged.  Such battery full circuits are almost always present in chargers made for specific devices.3. Unless you buy an adapter specifically for the iPod the USB adapter still requires an iPod charging cable which you may already have.I'm not saying that the Chargepod doesn't do what it's supposed to do but you should note these caveats.
4	Please see my review for this item under the link where it is sold as part of a starter pack which may make more sense for you to buy than just the unit alone(in which case you will have to buy separate adaptors for each gadget that you want to use) depending on your needs.
4	Although I didn't like my CallPod Dragon bluetooth headset I love this CallPod Charger.  I started running out of places to charge my multiple gadgets at night each one wanting is own outlet.  With this unit I charge two cell phones my bluetooth headset two Ipods and I still have room for expansion.  Best of all I only have to tie up a single outlet.My only complaint is that I would like to be able to turn off all the little LEDs for each connected device.  At night my bedroom ceiling glows blue due all those LEDs.
4	Paired flawlessly with my Chocolate.  Have used it almost 30 feet away from the phone without losing connection!  The earbud covers - you get two different ones (one set of one two of the other.)  The traditional round style have better sound but fill with sweat when working out. Literally fill - have to drain them every 15 minutes or so. The open style does not have this problem but has poorer sound quality and lets in more ambient noise.Yes you can only hear the phone calls in the left ear but that's the communication's standard.  If your phone transmitted it in stereo it would play in stereo.Basically make sure you know the phone/mp3 player/whatever the device is standard.  Don't blame the car if you buy the wrong seat covers. Don't blame the headset if you purchase it for the wrong device!It supports all current bluetooth standards. Does your device?
4	My ipod nano's wired headphones annoy me when I exercise so I wanted to find a wireless alternative. I was a little hesitant about buying these headphones and the ipod adaptor because of some negative reviews but after using them I was happy to find that I have had no problems. In fact these work great. The headphones fit comfortably in my ear and are easy to take on and off. The sound quality is better than my ipod headphones and is actually quite good. The touch sensitive controls for volume etc. take a little getting used to but with a little practice they are easy to operate.I am a runner and have used these headphones both on the treadmill in the gym as well as outdoors including very windy days. I have not experienced any loss of signal once the bluetooth connection has been established--and I have run literally hundreds of miles with this headset. It is a real pleasure to listen to my ipod without wires dangling all over me.Please note that the bluetooth connection between the headphones and the ipod does not take place instantly. Turn the headphones on and wait for the solid blue light to come on that indicates that the headphones are in bluetooth mode. Then (1) turn on the ipod (2) insert the adaptor (Note: inserting the adaptor before turning on the ipod did not permit a bluetooth connection to be established) (3) select the first song and (4) hit the play button on the ipod. There is usually a delay of 10-40 seconds before the headphones make a bluetooth connection with the ipod. Not a big deal. I just restart the song from the beginning.Making a bluetooth connection with my Samsung u-740 cell phone was a snap and answering calls on the headphones was easy. I had no problem with sound quality.Before purchasing these headphones and adaptor you should keep some things in mind.First in order to insert the adaptor into the opening on the bottom of the ipod either your ipod must be out of the case or you need a case that will give access. I use the latest Contour clear case which does not permit a completely snug fit(due to two small plastic tabs around the earphone hole; you can remove these if you want) but snug enough so that a bluetooth connection can be established and the adaptor is in tight enough so that I don't worry about it falling out and in fact it hasn't happened even when I run over rough terrain in the park. I bought an armband intended for the ipod shuffle and use the belt clip on my Contour case to clip my ipod and inserted adaptor to the armband when I run. Everything is nice and secure.Second if you wear glasses it works best to put the headphones on first and the glasses on second. The glasses won't fit quite as snugly as they normally do but for exercise it will be fine. I found that if I put my sunglasses on first the headphones did not fit as snugly in my ears with a resulting loss in sound. The same thing applies if you wear a headband or bandana--put the headphones on first.Third since the headphones are curved in the back if you wear anything with a collar that sticks up in the back the collar will push against the headphones which will come slightly out of their position in your ears. So wearing the headphones with a ski jacket won't work very well. With a thinner collar you will occasionally have to reposition the headphones as the collar pushes against them. Also if you wear a ski hat to run you will not be able to pull it down over your ears.Fourth because of the back of the neck design you will not be able to use these headphones comfortably to lay on your back (like on a blanket at the beach a couch in your den a chaise lounge by the pool) or to sit in a reclining position with your head back (like in a car or airplane).Fifth because the bluetooth adaptor goes into the socket that is used for charging there is no way to use the adaptor and charge your ipod at the same time as you can do using earbuds. Therefore for a long car or plane ride you are better off using your earbuds or some other headset.So don't throw away your ipod earbuds or over-the-ear headsets but do enjoy this unit in those situations where the limitations I described above don't matter.All in all I am very satisfied with this product. If you are looking for a wireless solution albeit not a perfect one this is it.Update Nov. 10 2008: I have now been using this product for one year and have been very satisfied with its performance. However I am now on my third pair.Shortly before Labor Day the battery did not seem to be holding a charge and I got a replacement set of headphones. I see from other reviews that other people have also had some battery issues though I have no idea how widespread that is.I started going to a new gym this fall and it tends to very humid where the treadmills are. A couple of nights ago I was drenched in sweat and so were the headphones. The volume control stopped working (it was stuck on the highest volume) and there was static coming out of one of the earbuds. Fortunately it was not too late to get another free replacement from the store where I purchased them.I note that all electronic items can be zapped by moisture unless they are specifically designed to be water resistant. It appears that these headphones are not. It never was an issue for me until I started running indoors at my new gym. Now that I know about the problem I will just wipe them periodically before the sweat really builds up.
4	when u r work out it is so nice.i have been use it for 3 years it is so nice that when u work out it is so fit
4	Bought this to replace the battery in my phone. Could get one from Motorola they don't sell them anymore. So it was great that I found this seller on amazon that still had them and the price was great too. Had the phone up and running within a few hours of receiving this battery.
4	Ordered for a Motorala Razor and perfomed well for the life of the product!Easy to use and replace when needed.
4	On paper this battery should give about 20% more time than the battery that came with my phone.  So far I've had the phone on 3+ days made some calls and the charge indicator still shows 4 bars. Needless to say I'm very happy and for about $5?  What a deal.Not sure why some people are having problems but the battery came with instructions and I did charge it for a full 8 hours before using it.Note: The battery seems a tad thicker but the door closes fine.  Just needs a bit of a push.
4	I obtained a BZ60 for a V3m because this is a slim battery. Same voltage but higher current rating than the battery which came with the phone (780mAh). Yes I can get the battery door closed.First charge cycle: battery didn't seem to last as long as expected. Second charge cycle: much better. By the third charge cycle I'm anticipating it outperforming the battery it replaced. I'm just making sure for the first few charges it gets a chance to completely drain before I'm re-charging it.Update: I'm finding the battery doesn't really last much longer than the one it replaces. If I take a few calls the battery life falls off pretty quickly. I do have a MicroSD card installed in the phone which is about 1/3rd full of personal music. I didn't think the SD card would take much power to retain it's contents. Oh well... The price is good.
4	This is the actual Motorola battery and now that I've had it for a while it seems to work exactly like the same expensive one you buy at a retailer.  The vendor shipped this quick packed it well and I'm impressed and pleased that I was able to get the right battery for my phone without paying half the price of the phone to get it.
4	i use this headset on my msi wind and i have tried many bt headsets. it turns out that most of them fall under the wireless store mantra. sell crap for more. but this headset sounds good plus you can step on it drop it loan it do a drunk friend and then have it fall out of a car and it still works. its a great product. just buy it and then you wont have to buy crap.
4	Great for working in the yard or exercise.  These guys are compact & lightweight.  Comfort is good though it decreases slightly on  extended use.  The earphones stay centered on your ears.  Phone call quality is excellent for both parties.  The controls are easy to use & well designed.The only negative was that the bass response was not as strong as I had hoped for but they sound good & work great.  For the price they can't be beat & they are quite handy on a cold windy day.
4	This headset works great on my Nokia 6300b cell phone. I bought it primarily to listen to music on my mobile phone without wires. The sound quality is great here with good bass.Pairing was simple. Just press the control button on the Cardo S-2 for about 7 seconds till you get alternating red and blue flashing lights and then go to your cell phone and add a new bluetooth device (make sure its in discoverable mode) with the 4 digit 0000 passcode. Since my Nokia also supports the AVRCP profile I'm able to control all the functions of the music player through pressing different parts of the Cardo S-2 headset. Moreover the headset is very comfortable to wear which is quite important.To get the stereo headset to work I first press the control button on the S-2 for about 3 seconds till I see blue flashing lights. Then I go to the bluetooth section on my cell phone and connect it to the Cardo S-2. Now I can open the music player and listen to beautiful music.This headset comes with a hidden microphone. I've used it for voice conversations with my Nokia and it performs quite well. What's most impressive is that it easily switches from stereo to regular voice calling  seamlessly. I hear everyone well and they hear me well too.I paired the Cardo S-2 with my Fujitsu laptop running XP Professional SP1 with the Widcomm software version 4.1 and couldn't get it to work with Realplayer or Windows Media Player at all. I then tried version 5.1 but the result was not much better:  just a few sporadic sounds came out. However when I paired it with the BlueSoleil software version 1.64 I got these headphones to work on my laptop. The music quality was good (but not as good as on my Nokia) but there were breaks once in a while in the music which I never had with my Nokia 6300b. However when I tried the software version 3.2 (Bluesoleil) the sound quality of the music was perfect with no gaps. The only remaining problem I had was that MSN Messenger and Yahoo Instant Messenger did not recognize the microphone on my Cardo S-2 (like my Nokia does). When I emailed Cardo's tech support and told them about this problem I got this abstract robotic response blaming Microsoft's drivers. But I remedied that by buying the tiny $5 Labtec Mic 333 and plugging it into the microphone jack of my laptop's sound card.I bought the Cardo S2 to use primarily with my Nokia so I am very happy with it. With my Nokia 6300b the Cardo S-2 deserves 5 stars. With my Fujitsu laptop I only give it 4 stars because I could not get the Cardo S2 microphone to work with Yahoo Instant Messenger or MSN Messenger.
4	these headphones are perfect for working out bike riding and anything else that you may do actively.  no wires means no interrupting when performing outdoor activities.  Just remember you need a2dp software for your phone to get the full effect of these headphones.
4	This item I purchased is better than I thought. I had a few others but this one does it all thank you.
4	Great price for these items and they look good; just like the picture.  They are leather and should hold up well with every day use.  Thanks.
4	This case has been wonderful! It was tight at first because I have a plastic case around my phone to protect the phone in case I drop it.  After a week or so the case has loosened up just right. I like the opening at the bottom because it allows me to push the phone out easier. I love the extra pocket too. If I don't want to take my purse I can slip in a credit card and my driver's license and they are under the flap and the pocket has snaps for extra security. The clip is REALLY tight too so it won't slip off of anything unless you take it off. I would buy it again! The service was wonderful too!
4	I bough this for my hubby he does construction and it really works for him. And not expensive nice and cool.
4	It didn't fit the phone I had bought it for but it fit my other phone my LG. Its nice black leather with a magnet closer that actually works. It was fast delivery. Would like to find a bigger one to fit my Fascinate just like it.
4	This case is so great I bought another one.  The main reason I bought this case is the two ways to attach to a belt.  I never trusted just the clip-on style and wanted belt loops.  This fit the bill on that.  What I also can do is slip the end of my headset thru the hole between the flap and the main body and then pull until the earpieces are against the body and then wrap the cord around the bottom where they join together and snap it closed.  I also have a folded up micro fiber cleaning cloth cash and a fold up stand slipped into the card slot.  That main body of the case holds my iPhone (which has an added snap-on case) securely neither too tight nor too loose.  I highly recommend this product and in fact ordered a second.  Such quality was very unexpected with such a low price.
4	I like this case a lot plus is very convenience specially is you don't wanna carry any purse you just put the credit card and the phone and go that's all you need :) and for the price it can't get not better than that thank you U guys have a bless day!
4	Its about time I found a case that will accept a shell case on the 3gs phone now. It has nice ports where you can pop you phone right out with your finger nice loop belt options and card slots.
4	This iPhone made cord will work with ANY standard 3.5mm jack.  This means not only will it work with your iPhone but will also with your Touch Nano Classic and what not.  This means this cord will work with any of the current audio devices you have that have a standard 3.5mm jack.  The only difference between the input jack on the iPhone and any other MP3 player is that the iPhone jack is deeper more recessed in than normal.  Cord is well constructed and very sturdy.  I use it in my Camry and the sound is excellent.
4	I purchased this auxiliary cable from Belkin because it works with my case. There is space between the contact and the head of the wire. Many cheap cables do no have this space making it impossible to fully plug in the cable without removing the phone case.Pros:Works with my case onSturdy wire (its not wimpy so it doesn't tangle easily)Looks pretty niceCons:Kinda pricy for a wire but you get what you pay forBy the way I have a Nexus 4 with a Diztronic case
4	Perfect for those cases that is hard to fit..like Otterbox and Speck! After I saw how well it fit I ordered another one!
4	i bought this at least 6 years ago & despite all of my abuse it still works flawlessly. there are much cheaper cables out there but this will probably outlast all of them.
4	I was looking for a AUX stereo cable for my iPhone 3G - this is long enough and sound is good.  People in the back of my sedan are able to hold my iphone while is connected.  Great cable
4	There is no need to get the Belkin iPhone audio adapter if you get this cable - it is already iPhone ready. I have a car that has an audio input jack for .mp3 players including iPod. With this cable I have no problem and need no adapter to hear the music on my iPhone and when I get an incoming call the music dims to silence and I can answer via my bluetooth headset or just pick up the phone.While it might make sense for home stereo use who needs 6 feet of this cable for use in your car? There is so much extra cable it's silly. I have a 'panic bar' above the glove box so I have wound the extra length of cable here... to keep it from hanging low where a passenger could accidentally yank it w/ their foot potentially damaging the audio jack cable or the iPhone itself.I suppose the length of cable is supposed to make you feel better for having spent this much on a cable. The ends are nice quality and pretty sturdy and the thick cable is nicely insulated less likely to have interference from crimping.My less than perfect rating is that there should be an option for shorter lengths - or at least it should come with a winding system.
4	I mainly got this to connect the iPhone to the receiver in the car. It looks pretty because it is white and matches the iphone well.  The not-so-desirable about it is that the length of the wire is a bit long when use in car.
4	This charger stopped working properly soon after the first iOS4 update.  I was getting a popup message Charging is not supported with this accessory.  You can fix this by installing a Cydia app named NoAccessorySplash iOS4 and it will fix the problem but this is a Cydia app.  You do not have a Jailbroken phone if you do not know what Cydia is.
4	I'm always a little skeptical buying these low dollar charging cables for iPhones because they tend to have problems. I have not had any problems with either of the two that I bought. The charging works correctly every time. I've had them for a couple months now and one of them unhooked at the plug-in port and came loose. I simply had to reconnect it and snap it back shot. Nothing broke and it still works perfectly fine. That's the only reason I gave it a 4/5.
4	Portable charger for iphone when you are away from your computer.  I bought this for my iphone 3G and it works perfectly.  It is a great inexpensive charger.  Does exactly what it say it will and is convienently one piece so you dont have to worry about losing other parts.
4	I'm not sure what to make of all of the negative reviews on this thing - it works fine for me in charging an iPod as well as my wife's iPad (I know the Kindle enthusiast has an iPad in the family - don't tell anyone).  There realy isn't too much you can say in a review for a product like this - it either works as advertised or it does not and in this case it does.  For this price it certainly beats purchasing an Apple-branded charger!
4	I had this item for a while before it finally went on me but it was do to wear and tear. It does just what it's made for packs nicely and it makes you look tech savvy.
4	I bought this about 4 or 5 months ago from Amazon (BargainCell) for less than a dollar +plus shipping; followed the instructions - cleaned the iphone wiped it clean with the given cloth and applied the screen. Screen goes in very nicely and no air bubbles. It has been more than four months and the screen still has no air bubbles and is protecting the screen very well.Another advantage is that this screen smudges MUCH less compared to the original iphone screen and so it doesn't look that bad. (still you need to clean the surface with moist paper or something once in a week or so).A great buy!
4	I ordered this for my Xbox 360 slim and it worked just as expected. Haven't had any issues with it. Shipping was quick and it was super easy to get working.
4	It gives you the capability to use a wireless headset with sound in unison with an hdmi cable causing no problems with my Xbox

4	Not only is this sticky pad great to keep things from sliding but you can trim it to fit an area or 'shelf' on the dash.
4	This pad is really good it works for the porpuse that is described obvisly of you put something really big or something too round it is going to fall with any movement of the car but for the phone glases coints some small papers etc. it works and is really easy to remove and replace in any part of the car board. Highly recomendable.Note: It also looks nice in black car boards.
4	Nice sticky pad to keep my phone and glasses from sliding across the dash when I turn. How many time have i done that when i take them off to look for a paper or phone charger when driving. Its a bad habit but so is reaching for the glasses across the car and still be driving but no more.
4	I put this sticky pad on top of a cup holder cover i have on my Honda Accord 2010. I tend to put ipods or my cellphone there and whenever the car moves it slides out and falls to the car's floor. Using this sticky pad it prevents that for me.It is easy to remove if you decide to get rid of it altogether. You don't have to stick it permanently on any part of your car.Things that don't bother me about it but should be noted.It doesn't stay on the cover that well.Its like it could fall off if there was enough dust between it and the cover.Just like any other sticky thingie this thing can easily collect dust. It looks like you can just wash it off though. I haven't tried.Update:Yep you can just pull it off wash it dry it properly (overnight) and put it back where it was.I bought a 2nd one so that I can put stuff on the dashboard now. So I can use the cupholder.
2	Item was purchased for spouse.  Was not what he really wanted but the item does work for the most part.
4	I always have triable keeping my phone from moving when in my sports car. I like to keep my phone close to my hands and this sticky pad allows me to do exactly that even when I make a sharp turn. The phone alway stays in place. If it gets a bit dusty you can wash it and is as good as new again.
4	Works as advertised.  It's a tacky pad that is non-adhesive and keeps stuff from sliding around on the dashboard.  Problem with the iPhone (4S) is that the back is a flat panel of Gorilla Glass and does not lift easily off the Sticky Pad.  Instead it tends to lift the Sticky Pad off the dashboard by sticking itself to the back of the iPhone.  I'm sure the problem would be solved by using an iPhone cover but then if I did I wouldn't need the Sticky Pad at all.
4	I did take off a star in the rating because products like these are marketed in a slightly exaggerated way.There's nothing &#34;sticky&#34; about the product.  The pad is made of a specific material that is able to hold the objects in place while you're driving.  It's not perfect but for the simple task of holding a cellphone sunglasses loose change perhaps your EZ-Pass it will do the trick.I place a camcorder there to film road trips and for the most part it stays put.  Like any other product of this type if you off-road drive over unpaved roads or you intentionally drive abnormally the contents of the pad may not stay put.Summary:  Just drive normally and you won't have a problem.
4	She used to keep her cell in the side door pocket and was always missing calls & messages but problem solved.Has never fallen off.
4	I bought a similar one @ a local store & was surprised how well it held my phone my sons phone & iPod.  I pd almost $6 & it is 1/2 the size of this one.  I needed another one & it looked bigger. Wow!! It's bigger I have a. Portable fan even on one of these!!  I loved it so much I bought another one. WARNING.... This has NOTHING to do w/ the product itself BUT if u use this for your phone iPod & it's HOT outside & u have this on ur dashboard... DO NOT put your phone or iPod on it!! My phone over heated!!!! Thank goodness it ok my phone.... But u live & learn. I also keep loose change on it... Glasses... Small toys stay too!!!!  Enjoy !!
4	Like so many other reviewers I had this Think Outside Stowaway collecting dust as I had bought it for an older phone.  I was actually looking on Amazon for a foldable keyboard and came across this and these reviews.  So I found my Stowaway (quicker than I thought I might!) did not load the software that came with it (as the instructions tell you to do) but just decided to see if it would sync with my Playbook.  First of course I had to put 2 AAA batteries in it and VOILA it worked!!!  I am a happy camper!!!  As another reviewer said it is surprising that some other manufacturer hasn't continued this concept in folding keyboards.
4	I just paired this with my Hisense Sero Pro and it works great. I've tried many portable keyboards but none with this build quality and keyboard comfort. Truly feels like a real keyboard that folds up small. The stand holds my 7 inch tablet well. No more lugging around my laptop. This is all I need.
4	I bought this keyboard when it was first released back in 2005 took it out today to test it with the idea of selling it. But after installing it on my current device (Verizon XV6800 running Windows Mobile 6.1) I decided I liked it too much to sell. I forgot how much I liked this keyboard. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of two annoyances:1. The numbers are accessible only through function keys - a bit of a pain. I would have preferred another row of keys. It wouldn't have added that much size or weight.2. When the keyboard is open it's supported in the middle by what becomes the case and the ends extend on either side like wings. If you are a slow typist this is fine. But I'm a fast typist and I tend to hit the the keys pretty hard so the keyboard tips from side to side when I type. Really irritating. I fixed this by making two little supports from stacked cardboard glued together. I stick these under the wings and that solves the problem.Here's where I got the latest driver released for the device (it's no longer supported by iGO):[...]This driver is for Windows Mobile 5 but it works on my Mobile 6.1 device. :)You MUST install the driver in MAIN MEMORY - not a storage card. If you install it on a storage card it won't work.After I installed the driver the configuration utility suggested that I upgrade the keyboard's firmware. I thought this wouldn't work since the keyboard is no longer supported by iGO but to my surprise it did - my firmware was updated from 1.1 to 1.2.The previous reviewer said he had to use the pointing stick to send email. That's because he didn't know the keyboard shortcut for Send: Alt-S.The keyboard folds up very small and compact and it's very light-weight - not a big deal to carry it around along with my SmartPhone. No more picking at the tiny on-screen keyboard when I want to send email from my phone!
4	Great sturdy design in every aspect. After pairing it features flawless instant connection to your device every time you open it. A keeper for long its quality shows it'll last for ages.I just wish iGO would start working on supporting Windows Mobile 6. It does perform as a keyboard should and it does carry out it's core functionality; but I can't find the drivers for my device or any other WM6 device for that manner. I am currently using similar ones which though do allow the device to work don't allow all function keys to carry their purpose or softkey support to be accurate.
4	I have infrared (IR) keyboards to use with my Palm Treo 650 and Palm TX. They don't work very well at least not for me. I had major problems with lag: characters I typed simply didn't make it to the screen.Taking a chance I bought the Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard . . . and I am very very impressed.Set-up is very quick and Stowaway's set-up software is simple to use. Reading the short user's manual (not the brief Quick Start) is a must. The learning curve isn't steep but because the keyboard is intended as a universal device tweaks have to be made for using it with Palm or Pocket PC devices.Once set up the keyboard performs superbly well. Every key I struck showed up immediately onscreen. I have large hands and I was concerned that I would encounter many typos because of my large fingers. I needn't have worried. The keys have a firm touch and the spacing is wide enough to keep typos to a miniumum. Because of the immediate feedback provided by Bluetooth I felt no tendency to go back and retype because the character didn't show up. I had no idea that the IR keyboard with its lag was causing me to do that so much.Others have commented about instability because the ends of the keyboard are essentially unsupported. At first this struck me as a design flaw but within a few minutes this is easily compensated for. I had little difficulty with my keystrokes causing the keyboard to rock.Some have also complained about devices slipping off the minimal stand provided. I had no problems with the Treo 650 or Palm TX.Finally a number of people have complained that there is no fifth row for entry of numbers. You have to use a function key + number combination or you can set the keyboard to number lock. If you have to enter a lot of numeric data the complaints are justified. On the other hand for people like me who have limited need for numeric entry it is an inconvenience but not a major one. I'm happy to trade a fifth row for numerics for the small size of the unit.Construction of the unit is typical for many of today's products. It's plastic with some metal but overall it does not feel like it is built like a tank. On the other hand it doesn't feel overy flimsy either. Time and use will tell how well the unit stands up.Overall this unit makes it eminently possible to use handheld devices like the Treo 650 and Palm TX for serious typing. I was surprised to find that I could type almost as rapidly on this keyboard as I can on a full-sized unit. The Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard is a very slick piece of work and well worth the cost for anyone who wants to use their smartphone or PDA for typing more than a few words.
4	Once you get a keyboard for your pda / smart phone you won't go back. This keyboard communicates via bluetooth and does a great job at turning your small device into a productive tool you won't want to be without. I use this keyboard with my Palm TX and it does a fabulous job during meetings - it's small (smaller than a notebook) VERY portable and reliable. the entire keyboard as well as my Palm PDA fits into the pant pocket of my cargo pants / shorts. You really can't get much more portable than that.To use you invoke a 3-button key combination to help it initiate contact with your device. Once connected you'll be off and running. My Palm TX will only stay on at 1-3 minute intervals so the only thing I don't like about this combination is that I have to keep hitting a key once in a while so my Palm doesn't shut off. This of course is a design flaw of the TX and not reflective of the keyboard.
4	This keyboard fills my left pocket and my Ultra mobile PC phone fills my right pocket.  This keyboard allows me to type at normal speed on a device I can keep in my pocket and I was astonished to see that it would have even worked for text messaging on my older phone the Nokia N-Gage.  If you have any HTC phone or any phone that supports bluetooth or this keyboard or even a PDA I highly recommend this product although it is costly.  Pair it with anything that can run TextMaker Office for WindowsMobile and you have a meeting powerhouse in your pocket that can tackle the best college note taking in a much more mobile manner than a laptop since you don't need to take it out of a bag plug it in and otherwise waste time.  I also suggest pairing it with the mouse by the same company for the same purpose.
4	I have an older PDA (Dell Axim X50) and this keyboard works great! The connection is Bluetooth and was easy to set up.  It is compact when folded up and very light yet feels fairly sturdy and responsive when typing.
4	The iGO bluetooth keyboard works great. The only complaint is the extreme left and right tips a little when typing.
4	For the money this is a great item and a must have for mobile road warriors. I am using the iGo keyboard with a Blackberry Curve (8300).Like others have said there is a nasty sticker that covers both the outside cover and the keys that may never completely come off. When peeling it off the keys it feels like the keys will rip off their fragile posts.Also as is common with Bluetooth getting the two devices to communicate with one another can be tricky. I haven't used it a lot yet so maybe I haven't figured out the right combination of button presses. But I hate when things don't simply work.The keyboard is fairly solid and certainly easy to type on especially if you're accustomed to typing on a laptop. The keys are marked with several shortcut functions to launch tasks or apps.This is a great item for anyone who wants a lightweight substitute for traveling with a laptop. While sitting in a hotel room checking e-mail this is all you need.
4	I purchased this keyboard so that I could start doing some serious word processing on my Treo 650 and I've been absolutely pleased!First off the keyboard does not come with the Treo 650 driver --- you must DOWNLOAD THIS DRIVER OFF OF THINK OUTSIDE'S websiteHowever downloading the driver is easy and from there you can sync it to your Treo or email it in an attachment to itOnce the drive is installed the keyboard is flawless!My biggest complaint about BlueTooth keyboards is that they lag as you type ---- but this is not the case with the Stowaway --- every key I pressed showed up INSTANTLY upon my Treo 650So far it has worked terrificly with my address book calendar and email (VersaMail)In addition the keyboard folds together well and is EXTREMELY thin and portable ---- I don't know if you could carry it in a pocket - but a backpack briefcase etc will not feel any extra weight with this productlastly - these keyboards are small --- I wish the delete key was bigger (as I often make typos) but nonetheless I'm very happy and certainly typing on this quicker than the phone's keyboardhighly recommended!HAPPY TYPING! HAPPY BUYING!
4	Originally created for use with Palm devices the iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard for PDAs and Handhelds is still among the best folding nearly full-sized Bluetooth keyboards available. Its metal case and relatively simple folding mechanism result in a durable product that has given me years of reliable service. The keyboard feels great; the throw of the keys is nice and tactile feedback is on a par with many laptop keyboards. My fingers are none too slim and they easily fit on to this keyboard. Like many of us these days I'm a touch typist and I find using this keyboard as comfortable as any I might find particularly on most laptop computers. I've owned a couple of these - not because they wear out (I still own and use the first one I purchased nearly a decade ago) - but because I find it's useful to have one at my bedside and another in my gear bag.Powered by AAA batteries makes it easy to operate. There's no proprietary power source or charging system required. It sips power too; I find it lasts and lasts on a pair of NiMH rechargeable batteries.Pairing with a phone or other device is very simple. However my Symbian phones do not handle this as they should any authorized peripheral. I have to manually connect; I cannot just turn the keyboard on and start to type in order to get the keyboard and phone to connect. I suspect this a deficiency with the Symbian OS and not with the keyboard.The folding stand is very useful and fits a variety of devices of roughly phone-size in either a portrait or landscape configuration.Even without its zippered case this keyboard travels very nicely and has a durable aluminum shell.Why didn't I give this a perfect 5-star rating? The keypad is available I think only with the functions of the old Palm OS mapped on to the keys. It doesn't undermine the use of the keyboard with other operating systems but can sometimes be distracting that the keys are printed with functions either not available on your phone's operating system or the keys cannot actually perform that function.I find it very unfortunate that most so-called smart phones do not support mapping special functions on to Bluetooth keyboards. Admittedly this is not a shortcoming of the keyboard itself. Phone manufacturers are simply more interested in equipping their systems with eye-candy and games rather than the kinds of productivity enhancements which might make their devices more useful to those of us who try to rely upon them to aid is in our work and home lives.It is astonishing to me that this keyboard isn't more popular and being emulated by other manufacturers. It would be terrific if it were to ship with software that could enable iOS Android and Symbian devices to map functions to its keys.I highly recommend this keyboard if you are looking for a durable reliable and comfortable folding Bluetooth keyboard for your handheld device.
4	It is so funny watching text fly into my T-Mobile SDA smartphone (aka iMate SP5m or HTC Tornado) using the Stowaway keyboard. This keyboard is all class: just like a laptop keyboard with the same spring to the keys quality durability and lovely looks to boot.Entering numbers is get-used-to'able however symbols such as () and & or % can be a major pain due to the fact that a) you have to use custom key commands using ctrl fn1 and fn2 buttons and b) if you are an experienced typer you already know the motion for & or * or () and you'll find yourself doing them! (meaning you are incorrect on this keyboard)That said entry is obviously very fast and natural as this is a proper keyboard just with some multi-purposed keys requiring key combos.The only solution is to FORCE yourself through it and just do it. You will get used to it just like you got used to fast touch-typing.Anyhow this thing is a gem for hammering out quick SMS text messages etc. I mean no more click-click-click clack-clack click-click-click-click clack-clack to type out a single four-letter word. Nothing feels quite like that lol!This thing will fit EASILY in a purse and will fit in a men's pant pocket. I wear shorts pants etc. and it fits fine.The keyboard clicks are quite silent. I use this in class to quicly type out extensive class notes as I can type far faster (and more legibly) than I can hand-write.The case is durable sandblasted aluminum (like my old minidisc player) and the detachable device stand is sweet! I use it all the time to put my phone on one of those little chair-mounted desks in class and type in my lap. Sweet!Anyhow is this thing essential? I mean I kinda hate not having a notebook around when in say a statistics class with graphs and stuff...you can't draw graphs with this thing very well. However for text-based notes in a college setting this thing is well worth it. A smartphone as above and a keyboard and you have one of THE major functions of a laptop but without having to carry a laptop. Just the phone you'd have anyways and this flat little thing.NOTE: if you have troubles reconnecting this thing use the bluetooth connect on your phone first then use the special driver provided by Think Outside to finish the connection. Two part process.In all I am a college student and I wish I did not have to pay over $80 for this unit (why can't they make it for $30?) but in the end this thing is slightly sweeter than it's price so it's worth it.
0	I struggled with trying to get this thing to work with my Blackberry 8700g for some time.  I even selected and downloaded a driver that was listed for Blackberry devices on the product web site.  After a lot of frustration I finally got my Blackberry to pair with the keyboard but it would still not recognize it when I tried to get it to link to it.  I contacted iGo product support and they informed me that: Unfortunately we do not have a driver for that device currently.  So I ended up wasting a lot of time on this keyboard that is supposedly for Blackberry and other PDA/Handhelds.By the way the carton itself does not state that it works with Blackberry devices only with Smartphones.  A fairly obscure barcode sticker on the back does indicate in small letters that it also works for Blackberry.  In my case though back it goes which really is a shame because I like the quality of the item otherwise and I am sure I could have made good use of it.  In the mean time I guess I'll keep looking.Lastly I also agree with the other reviewer who vented about the stupid sticker they place on the unit.  It is glued to the keyboard and to the front surface and is quite a pain to remove.
4	I bought this to work with a Palm T3 years ago. They never produced good Palm drivers so it was pretty much worthless. It's been sitting in a drawer for five years and some of the keys stick but they can be prised up with the corner of a credit card. The keyboard syncs cleanly with an iPad 2 and if you can tolerate the way it rocks back and forth as you type it works fine.
4	It always worries me when devices like this are still being sold at retail while third party sellers are able to sell them for under what wholesale would seem to be for the stated retail price. Usually this reflects a liquidation by the manufacturer. But sometimes that allows you to try a gadget that you otherwise might not be able to afford. And if you need the gadget for its originally designed purpose it may well be just what you want despite being obsolescent. It is pure speculation on my part but I believe that the market need now requires F1-F12 keys and this device does not have them.I've considered PDA keyboards before but they always impressed me as flimsy junk not possibly able to stand up to the rigors of travel or even more than occasional use. This one is different - I believe that if I put it in its little paddded bag it could go into my black bag and come out after 6 trips two weeka later in the same shape ready to go when I needed it.  The aluminum construction seems as solid as it poaaibly can for a folding device.When I look at the support forums for the device on the manufacturer's web site I see that people are asking about support for portable windows devices.  This keyboard has no traditional windows function keys (originally F1-F10 now (and for many years) F1-F12) [Sidebar: Why 12?  Because that is how many the IBM 3270 a special purpose mainframe terminal used by the designers had] and without those you probably can't use it effectively with windows. I paired it with my laptop and I was able to use it as a keyboard without special drivers.  Probably with a great free program called anyhotkey I could get it to simulate the sending of pfks using extra non-momentary shifts but why?  A wireless or wired full sized keyboard is what you need on a system like this.I had no trouble getting used to left (blue) function shifting for numbers and right (green) function shifting for top line punctuation although I wish the silk screening had been against an ivory background and not the gunmetal grey one.  While it might be possible for a driver to use multiple shifts to simulate F1-F12 what then about shifted keys? If the shift to get F4 includes a chord with the alt key how would you then type alt-F4? The only possible way I could see was if this was something that you got by pushing both blue and green shifts and the top line but if you then accidentally hit cntl you'd put the keyboard into pairing mode.So I believe that they are as I write this available at a great price for their intended market - Palm PDAs Some Smartphones and such. But not having function keys limits this keyboard's future specifically Windows Mobile devices that can be used with a full Bluetooth keyboard won't be fully functional when you use this device as a keyboard.One other thing that I did was to try it with my PS3.  Works great and the PS3 does not use F1-F12 so this is probably the perfect occasional use keyboard for the PS3 - you can text with it or type addresses if you are surfing or use it for naming things without having to have a full sized keyboard wired to the PS3 (or a full sized bluetooth keyboard taking up space). Nothing special I just paired it and then typed the number the PS3 gave me on its screen.My main use for this is as a keyboard formy Palm T|X. I downloaded the drivers and synced the T|X.  I then went through setting up a secure connection. The only thing that I do not like (and I am not sure what to do about it) is that whenever I want to use the keyboard I can't just open it up and start using it. I have to open it go to applications start the keyboard application go into bluetooth configuration tell it to connect dismiss the warning that the keyboard has to be paired in the device list and then do the cntl-greenFN-blueFN chord to make the keyboard discoverable. Then it connects and the keyboard works and I can change to another application and the keyboard still works.This needs to be done often enough that I made an input area icon (the touchscreen areas that allow you to immediately bring up an application) start the keyboard app.I believe that this is an issue with the way the Palm OS works. Other systems don't seem to need this manual restart of the drivers.Once that is done so long as the palm does not need to be reset the keyboard will work as soon as it comes on - so long as you do not use another bluetooth device. According to the release notes the Palm Bluetooth support can only talk to one device at a time. If the keyboard is unused it will power down after a couple minutes. But when you touch a key it will resume communications immediately without going through the menu. No it is not a full sized keyboard and there are some compromises but it has a really good feel even compared to many full sized keyboards I own.When one opens the keyboard the first thing to do is to extend the palmtop support. The little arm that the palmtop rests on is spring loaded and pops past a stop - if you like it at that first stop be careful to block the rest with your thumb. There is a release on one side to open the keyboard a release on the top that holds the keyboard open and which needs to be released when you want to close it. Just go slow.There is a single feedback light.  Off? Keyboard is not connected. Fast blink? Keyboard is ready to connect. Slow blink? Keyboard is connected. Red? Low battery.Simple easy to use and works well. This is not a PC keyboard and it is not a heavy stationary keyboard. For what it is sold for it is best of breed.
4	I received the item in a timely manor but the best thing about this product was the outstanding response I received by the seller. It was an excellent purchase experience and excellent customer service.  I would buy from this seller again.  I was unable to make the item work with my blackberry 8310 and the seller provided me the opportunity to return it for a full refund however my life got busy and the time alloted to return it expired but that's my fault and not the seller.
4	Use it for my Nokia N95-3 and it works very well.A bit bulky since its not really pocketable but fits in any bags for easy transport.Great for using it on airplanes since it is small and will not take up the entire table.Some keys are very touchy since I noticed that the E button will press twice.All in all a very nice product!
2	I have the version designed and manufactured for Dell by Think Outside Inc.  It is the same as this product but the keys are black.  The keyboard works great.  The keyboard folds up flat and is about 4x6 and it is thin.  It folds out to a full size keyboard when opened the keyboard latches so it won't fold up when you are typing and the keys have a great feel.  Loading the software to my Axim x30 and configuring the keyboard went smoothly and although I am somewhat comfortable with technology  I am not a techie by any measure.  The bluetooth is great and there is no need to carry cables and wires and this option has worked well for me for the past two years.The only problem I have is with the stand.  The stand is made with very flimsy plastic; although the manual says that it is detachable I would recommend extreme caution. After two years of extremely careful treatment my stand broke.I don't know if Think Outside Inc. will sell me this plastic part (I plan to contact them) but Dell does not stock or sell this part even though it is detachable; it does not take a genius to see that this part will not wear well.  After being transferred to four departments and then told to call their parts store the fifth Dell customer service representative told me to either purchase a new keyboard for $99.00 or carry my cradle around.  This seems silly and wasteful.If you work from one location and can use your cradle to hold your Pocket PC this is not an issue.  But if like me you purchased this for travel and portability and do not take your cradle with you this is a problem.So this is a great product with the above exception.  As a consumer I hope that manufacturers begin to learn that when you purchase something like this you expect quality.  It should not only work well but hold up under normal use and parts should be made available and easy to find.-Feb. 21 2006Update:  I contacted Think Outside Inc. through their website.  They sent me two replacement stands free of charge.  The customer service department was nice and I got the stands within three business days.  Great customer service!-Feb. 24 2006Another Update:  I am still using the keyboard and it still works great and my replacement stand is holding up and I still have the extra they sent me.  I would purchase this again and I wish sellers like Dell knew to direct customers who experienced the problem I did to Think Outside for replacement parts.  They had excellent customer service unlike Dell (they wanted me to purchase another keyboard).-Sept. 15 2006
4	Great ideal for a product works perfectly and as advertised.  I just think its another item for the bag with the laptop when you are traveling.
4	Works great with my Moto Q.  Typing sound is annoying but easily turned off.I also caution that you should probably store the batteries uninstalled.  I put a brand new set of Duracells in it and they were dead a month later with almost no use (Just sitting in my briefcase)  I discovered this at the start of a 5 hour flight and fortunately was able to cannibalize a set from my MP3 player.  This only happened once so I can't say for sure that the keyboard sucked them dry.What really annoyed me was the Fold and unfold sticker which had some sort of industrial adhesive.  What a stupid thing to use.  It took me 25 minutes with cleaning solvent to get that darn thing off.  Also the black vinyl zippered pouch stinks like some toxic chemical.  If not for those two things I'd rate it 5 stars
4	Long battery life connects quickly to phone. Phone callers can't even tell I am on a BT headset no complaints of inablility to hear my voice will on a call. It is not for people with wide necks does not stretch much. Can slide back when active and the earphones are not in your ears. Otherwise light controls are easy to reach and distiguish. I have the similar LG HBS730 but prefer these due to the ease of finding the buttons you want but prefer the flexible neck of the LGs.
2	I have had an LG-700 for a few years and I love it.  But I get complaints from people about the microphone picking up extraneous noises when I am on the phone in a supermarket or working in the kitchen so when it started to wear out I tried this one.  Well....this does have pretty good sound BUT the rigid frame for the yoke is a problem for this guy with a 17.5 neck.  And the location of the on/off switch is annoying (on the back).  Plus whereas the LG-700 has 6 buttons this has 4 and the buttons are sorely missed for all of the needed functions of such a headset.  I often get the Equalization changed message when I am trying to get Siri to pop up...very annoying!  On the plus side it does seem to connect to my iPhone quickly and the signal seems pretty stable.All in all it is nice...but misses in a few ways.****************Update:  After 3 weeks I returned this to Amazon.  The fit was just too annoying.  Thank you Amazon for your great return policies!
4	Pros:1) Excellent call clarity and loudness both ways2) Excellent for listening to music3) Fits snugly and stays put around your neck while exercising (unlike the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730)4) Feels much better than theLG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 when in contact with your skinCons:1) Connectivity is not as good as with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 e.g. it does not connect to 2 devices as once and you have to first disconnect it from the device it's currently connected to before it connects to a new device. The LG does not have this annoying problem.2) The power button is located all the way in the back and it's awkward and difficult to power on or off  unlike theLG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7303) Does not vibrate when you receive a call4) Does not have easily accessible buttons like the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7305) Does not look as good as the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7306) Does not announce the battery level like the LG7) The battery life is good but subpar to the LGOverall this Bluetooth Headset offers excellent sound quality (as good as you get with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730) but overall it's very poorly and unintuitively designed compared with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 and does not have as good seamless and versatile connectivityI've had both for about a month and the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 is clearly the better headset overall.I will be returning this one mainly because I'm tired of the problematic connectivity and the very unintuitive design.
4	I bought these to replace my LG headset which kept dropping audio during phone calls.  The sound quality is very good.  It has a longer range than the LG. Overall very pleased.  The software that runs the headset is not as advanced as the LG it doesn't announce the battery level and it can only be connected to one device at a time.  When it announces it is connected if two of your devices have bluetooth on at the same time you don't know which one it is connected to because it does not identify the unit it is connected to.Overall though I like them a lot.  The sound quality is very important to me and I wear them a lot when I am listening to programs on netflix and for my day-to-day phone use.
4	I have been a fan of the LG HBS series since the amazingHBS-700and also own theHBS-730and the newHBS-800.With the SF500 Motorola has clearly taken a more than close look at the HBS series and attempted to improve on it. Here's how I find these two compare:- Battery life: Moto wins. This thing keeps on going and lasts even longer than the already amazing HBS-730. Too bad the remaining battery life estimator is so inaccurate (it reports 4 hours remaining on a full charge when it's much closer to 10)- Convenience and durability: Moto wins again. The Buds sit tight around your neck and don't bounce. The cords are not as fragile on the LGs and the magnets holding the earbuds are much stronger on the Moto Buds. Unlike the HBS-730 and 800 the Buds do not report their power level to the Bluetooth host (the iPhone shows a little bar next to the bluetooth icon indicating the battery status when you use the LG headphones). That's funny since the older SF600 have the feature.- Ergonomy: LG wins big time. The button layout and functionality are intuitive and logical on the LG and completely convoluted and inconvenient on the Buds; on the Buds the same button is used for FF (one press) or REW (two presses); also the power button on the LG is a sliding switch whereas the Buds use an electronic switch which makes it much more difficult to find out if your headset is on or off.- Sound quality: I would rate the Buds somewhere between the 700 and the 730; mostly they lack bass and presence.- Range: excellent but the outlandish 150ft range advertised is only available when connected to a Bluetooth Class 1 device and these are rare -- only featured on a few Motorola phones as far as I could tell. When connected to a Class 2 device (which most devices are) the range is 33ft like all other devices; I think Motorola is a little disingenuous when advertising this extended range.In conclusion... They're not bad and if the LG series didn't exist they would deserve 5 stars. However considering they're a blatant rip-off of a successful concept it's disappointing that Motorola improved on some of the flaws of the HBS series (mostly the cord durability and the magnet strength) but failed to pick up on the ergonomy (button layout power switch).Which one should you pick? in my opinion the cheapest one you can find unless you need to connect to two devices in which case the Moto Buds or the HBS-800 are a must; and if you easily get irritated and confused by complicated controls stay away from the Buds.Recommended but they're not the LG HBS-series killer that Motorola probably designed them to be.
4	It is not the greatest  The sounds works fine on most calls.  it is not very good on call overseas.  people don't hear very well.  However I am mostly satisfied with it.
4	Excellent sound quality and easy to pair. Looked just as the ad said and the shipping was right on the money.
4	I'm using mine with the Jabra A210 non-bluetooth phone adapter and it works fine. I've used it in the office on my cellphone (handsfree allows me to type and talk with no wires) I use it in the car and it gives me great movement without wires. Very small clips around the ear and you don't even realize its there. Very pleased with this unit. I charge it overnight and it works all day from 530am till 11pm constantly receiving calls. I've had this for a about a week and I'll leave it on this weekend to see just how long it will last before running out of gas. I'm pleased with the quality of the Microphone and Earpiece. Can't believe just how well the mic works. I can shout and whisper and the volume is constant. This is my first bluetooth earpiece and I'm happy with it ! Some calls have slight distortion but since other calls are crystal clear I have to believe its the cellphone connection and not the earpiece.
4	This headset works fine. It fits perfectly over the ear. Volume isgreat! connects quickly. No echooo. Maybe all the nay sayers need abetter cell phone. I've tried three bluetooth devices and the HS820 isfar superior to the rest.
4	I bought this headset for probably the same reason most people did the price. For 30 bucks and from a reliable company you can't go wrong. I got what I paid for. The sound quality and the mic quality are both decent enough at least for someone who isn't obsessive about how crystal clear the reception is. It has a tendency to drop the connection sometimes for no apparent reason annoying at times but not very common.About a month after use it stopped working for no explicit reason. I sent it back and got a replacement from Motorola. However only a month or so after that I seemed to have misplaced it and had pretty much thought it was lost.Today about a month and a half later I found it in my dryer. Apparently it had been in the pocket of one of my jeans that I hadn't washed for a while and it went through a whole wash and dry cycle. Happy that I found it but I all but gave up on it to work again. I gave it a shot anyway and lo and behold it did start charging. So after an hour I tried pairing it with my phone and voila IT STILL WORKS! I was stunned. Not only that a bluetooth headset could go through that abuse and still function like new but a headset that seems relatively cheap and outdated!So based on my first experience it was a 2 but any piece of electronic equipment that can survive a wash and dry HAS to get two more stars in my book. Reliable and saved me from shelling out more money for a more expensive replacement. It gets the job done.
4	I always thought it was obnoxious to leave your headset on all the time but now i know why people do it. One you forget you have it on and two it's kind of a pain in the neck to setup. This particular product is pretty good it pairs up well with my RAZR after saying yes to no less than three questions and works very well. The only complaint I have is it could be louder but it serves my purpose.
4	I love this headset.  It's light has good voice quality louder earpiece volume than the phone itself (Mot V710) and the battery outlasts the phone.  A previous reviewer mentioned having to carry 2 chargers.  Motorola makes a Y adapter so you can charge both your phone and headset from 1 charger.  I think I paid under $10 for it but don't quote me.  I love the headset but when I'm in an airport it picks up the background noise as loudly as my voice.  If it was noise canceling it would have gotten 5 stars.  One last note: My phone doesn't ring when connected to the headset so you must have the headset on to know you have an incoming call.  This is a complaint about the phone though not the headset.Update 03-05-2005I just bought an HS-810 because I keep getting complaints of background noise being louder than my voice.  I like it better but the 820 does have better incoming sound quality.  But all in all I like the 810 much better.  The flip open design is especially nice.  Search for the HS810 to see my complete review.Update 07-21-2005My Motorola V710 went in the dunk a few months ago so I had to buy a new one.  The new software allows the phone to ring even when the headset is connected.  Much better.
4	I got this as a Christmas present for my brother and he absoultely loves it. When talking to him it sounds very clear and there is no static. It is a much better than my Jabra headset which cost nearly twice the price.
4	At first I was a bit leary about buying one of these because I had heard that they were never loud enough unless you were in a very quiet place. NOT TRUE! I have to say I've had to turn down the volume on this before! Now don't take that out of context but this is a great product. I live in Texas and drive a loud truck and I've been able to use this product driving down the road! I would definitely recommend this product. A great purchase for the money.
4	This is a great cable for me !!I love using it in my car.I connect it to my smartphone to listen to my radio app while I am traveling out of town.Once I lose  range of my favorite  radio station I plug it in and  continue listening  to my favorite radio station thru the app. .Great deal !
0	Don't purchase these if you plan to use in your car. The side walls are too thin and if this lays next to any 12 power source my Sirus Radio in my case you'll get the electrical whine as the cars rpm's increase and decrease. You get what you pay for.
4	It does what it's supposed to.  Hook up my cell phone to my car so I can listen to my mp3.  I'm not a audio geek/master so I don't know if it's a good decibel or crisp bass or tremble but songs seems to play well.
0	Received it plugged it in didn't work. Tried jostling the cable and plug around couldn't get it to work. Can't recommend it.
4	I bought one for my dad to use occasionally and tested it for a couple songs and had no issues like others have had maybe I'm not using it as long. It is cheaper feeling than my more expensive ones. I will update this if things change.
4	We bought this item to replace a broken 3.5 mm cable we use to connect our FM modulator to our iPhone 4s.  We needed something with a thin piece of rubber over the plug so that it didn't catch on the after-market case on our iPhones.  this product worked great and the price was excellent.
0	Bought this as a line-in cable for my in-dash stereo from my cell phone. The cable does not work. I only get sound out of one side of the stereo when it's fully plugged in. In order to hear stereo i need to hold cable out to before the spring click. Unfortunately this doesn't suit my needs for the car.
4	The price was good and the cable works great. It seems to be well made. There isn't much else to say about this product.
4	This is a basic cable.  It works and it is cheap.  There is not much else you can say about it.
4	The concept of the phone is terrific.  I have to use a 2-way pager for work and instead of carting around a cell phone and bulky pager I now just have this one small item.  And while I didn't think I'd really use it the Bluetooth functionality has definitely sold me.  I can use it not only for a wireless headset but to connect to the internet and to transfer sound files back and forth as well.The software of the phone seems to be a bit buggy still unfortunately.  When I lock the keypad I still sometimes hear tones when the keypad is pressed and the display lights up.  The menus are sometimes slow to respond delaying as much as 2 full seconds (doesn't sound like much but it can be irritating).Overall I'd buy the phone again without hesitation but I'm an early adopter.  If you're willing to put up with the occassional buggy behavior I'd definitely recommend this phone.
4	I really enjoy this device--being able to check email and blogs and send IMs while out and about is really nice. However it's kinda huge compared to a regular cellphone and I found that to be a bit of a drag. My service agreement seemed kind of pricey  and the coverage was poor (I couldn't get a signal in my own kitchen and I live in the middle of a big city not out in the country) and in the end I've shelved this phone for a smaller one with a cheaper monthly fee.
4	I started out with the sidekick color switched for a short time to the Blackberry 7100t and then came back to the sidekick II. I So love this phone. There is no other phone on the market that compares in many areas.Pro's -Super easy to use.Best messaging out therebest screen out therecrazy good data servicegood downloads for ringtones games and appsGreat signal (I was in rural Kentucky and still got a signal)Very reliableBest Data/Voice plan with T-mobile -- I have been with T-mobile for 5 years or so and have tried other services during that time. No other service has provided any better phone signal or features for a lower or even a competitive price.Con'sIn order for service to remain good you have to periodically reset the phone. Dont know why but when I do that it fixes any reception problems. T-Mobile techs said this was a good idea.That's it everything else is normal and great about this phone.Unless you need corporate email dont bother with the blackberry. It was the worst phone I have ever used.
4	I've had my SKII fo a little over a month now and find it a good fit for my needs.  I am a business user not a Snoop Dog groupie and this is a VERY cool device.Coverage in my area (Austin TX is good)and while I have not yet traveled away from the IH-35 corridor I had good voice and data coverage all the way to the TX/OK stateline (as far north as I went). For $20/month all you can eat data this is a screaming deal.  I don't find the web surfing that useful (speed is about like a 28kbps dial-up connection) but for email it is superior to the Blackberry 957 I used a number of years ago.  The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger's servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident but if that's a concern limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth no resident memory for email pictures etc no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry) intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email. The web and other stuff are OK but TMO data network will have to get faster and more WAP coded websites for content that is relevent for that to be a big reason to buy/use this device.I purchased through Danger's website total cost $0 after $200 instant discount and $100 in rebates. Worth a year's contract with TMO in my book.  Paying $49/mo for 3000 regional anytime minuets and $20/mo for all you can eat data (email text messaging etc etc EVERYTHING DATA included).I would recommend this to anyone that really needs email and occaisional web service in addition to phone service.  Not the smallest/best coolest phone but the best convergent communication device on the market right now IMHO.
4	Pro's:Very easy to use.Qwerty keyboardOTA (Over The Air) software upgrades that add usability to it once or twice a year.Full buddy list loading for AIM and YIM.Synchs to both Windows and Mac computers.Large clear screen.Allow for export of web bookmarks.Use up to three Pop3 or Imap4 email addresses with it.Con'sNo external memory.limited camera memory.no Bluetooth.no spell checker for the emailNo Microsoft Exchange email support so no corporate email unless it is a Pop3 or allows you to login from the web.Overall an excellent device.
4	I give it five stars - despite some technical problems:You can send and receive vcfs in e-mail attachments - but you can't always file them when you receive them. They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually.  This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory and otherwise are formatted correctly they will get taken. But some applications for example evolution that great Linux e-mail application does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename so the sidekick will not file evolution's vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).Rather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard's formatting the sidekick uses the filename. This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface so be careful.You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs but you can't click on them. You can't click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself then click on the URLs out of the mail where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say With a regular browser why would I care about a WAP browser? - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site).  So you can't browse them at all from the phone.That is about it.  Most of the rest is great. I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site and in openoffice I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express and then imported.  Oh yes I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file just like Outlook had and poof in about a minute a couple hundred phone numbers addresses and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.  I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using but that didn't work.I've resisted all the games (I want MINESWEEPER - yes I know it is lame).  I might have to drop $4 for solitare.I did drop $10 for the terminal program and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device. I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode by port. I can ssh securely to my server. There are lots of disconnects mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes but a program available in Linux called screen allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them see their output get status and all that stuff. I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.Someone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal it took eight on the tiny terminal. In many ways emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode but they both work.One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only sorry.To echo the comments about the AIM client which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client which drops and reconnects all the time is probably worthwhile.The documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed. But many buttons are graphical and unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text or if there is none [IMAGE] the button completely goes away which means that you can't access what the button points to. This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.Occasionally web sites are mis-represented - on eBay for example there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there (which seems the right place) searches don't work.Despite all these niggling problems and t-mobile's hapless tech support I am still giving this device five stars. The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.The difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.I did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh browse at all much less pull up mapquest maps.
4	The Sidekick 2 has a better form factor than the competitors such as Treo 600/610 and Blackberry offerings. It has a better more comfortable keyboard. It's more like a mini computer than a phone which I like. It can fully multitask unlike Palm. You can download a webpage check email and chat on AIM all at the same time unlike  on the Palm which will interrupt the process if you leave the application. Further the Sidekick II has both AIM and Yahoo! Messenger.I like the built in camera and I find I don't miss having a Palm at all especially now that you can use Intellisync with the Sidekick 2 to sync all your contact/calendar information with your desktop computer. I never really liked stylus input on the Palm anyway and again the keyboard on the Sidekick is a lot better. The Blackberry units are nice however I still find the Sidekick more cool easier to use and it has better instant messaging capabilities.My only slight complaint is that the Sidekick 2 does not have a replaceble battery. I would much prefer to be able to swap out the battery.
4	I have used a lot of screen protectors for my iphone and this one is the best. I'm happy to finally have a clear screen cover that works. For the past two years I wouldn't even try them using only the anti-glare covers. Then I would get tired of the anti-glare covers because in my opinion they detracted from the attractiveness of the screen.This cover looks great; you have to look real close to even realize there is a cover on there (wasn't the case with previous clear covers I had used). Boxwave sent me cleaning supplies with the two covers - that made it very easy to apply without getting any dust caught in between. And finally finger prints do not show up as readily as they do when there is no cover.Nice screen cover. Highly recommended.
4	The order was delivered on time and the clear touch is nice fit for my Galaxy S4. I ordered the anti glare version and it is easy to apply w/o any air bubbles. The protector works nice on the sun light. Also no finger prints or marks visible. Would definitely recommencement.
4	Absolutely love this screen protector. It came on time and the product was just as expected. I love how it comes equipped with everything you need to install it. A wetnap dry nap cleaning cloth and the flattening clip you use to even out the protector once its on. It looked very professional and my Galaxy S4 Screen looks SUPER vibrant and clean. You can not even tell that theres a screen protector. I would recommend this screen protector to anyone because the value surpasses the price. Afforable and efficient.
4	I've been a loyal BoxWave customer for years. The quality price value and dust free installation are unbeatable. These shields do a great job at protecting ALL of my electronics and also hold up well to scratches so that I don't need to even replace them. Could not be happier.
4	Just recived my screen protectors and there amazing. They came packaged very well. They come with a very thivk cleaning cloth and some wet and dry cleaning wipes. Once I put on protector on it was really clear no problems at all great feeling to the protector it was cut really well. Will defenetly buy more when I need them wont be using another protector but boxwave.. very satisfied (:
4	Oh my crystal clear... stands up to its name. ..absolutely easy directions to follow... No lint. . my screen looks like it has no protector on it. I am very careful with my device so I do not know how it will handle items scratching the screen or fingerprints..I received it quickly and I didn't have to pay for shipping plus because I bought one item received this packet for free. It comes with two screen protectors. If you follow the directions you should not need the other. I have purchased others and followed the directions and still end up with lint underneath... YES I would recommend this item. ..It is a must have for your phone. ..
4	I'm a lover of all gadgets and always have to get the coolest cell phone out there at the time.  This phone has been really great over the past 14+ months that I've owned it (I have the blue version).  I've not had ONE problem with it doing anything it shouldn't do (i.e. randomly powering off antenna problems etc).  I cannot say that for every cell phone I've ever owned.  LG makes a great cell phone and within their different models I think this one is the best I've seen so far.  My brother has this exact model and loves it too.The phone has a beautiful color screen easy to navigate menus a nice camera and video function and OUTSTANDING battery life.  The only complaint I will echo is that it would be nice at times to have a speakerphone.  Other than that this cell phone is the best I've found - including several other LG models that friends and family own.
4	I had it over 3 years and it was working great. Battery lasts very long. Phone is very durable and solid.
4	Ok so I used to have a Motorola T720 (one of the worst phones made) and a Motorola Timeport 8767 (One of the best phones ever made).  I needed a new phone and ventured into the local Verizon Wireless store.  I happen upon the LG VX7000 and think...this thing is huge!  I don't need a camera in my phone...but then I pick it up and play around with it.  It's pretty comfortable to hold.  The screen is nice bright and clear.  I wind up purchasing one from VZW online and when the phone arrives I put it to the test.This phone so far for me has been terrific! The phone itself is a tad larger than my last T720 but not by much...the main LCD is a nice bright TFT screen.  Included are some wallpapers 3 real pics(A Sunset scene an island scene and a group of people scene) a Verizon Logo wallpaper and a few doodle type cartoony pics.  You can change the settings for the display easily as the UI for this LG is much better than my old Moto.  The front LCD is nice enough...you can also set a wallpaper here or use a pic taken from the camera to use as a picture ID when that person calls.Ringtones...kinda forgettable (I am beginning to think cell phone providers tell phone makers to make some pretty useless ringers so you download decent ones).  You can however record your own which sound surprisingly good with the internal mic as well as download them from Verizon's Get It Now Brew service.  You can also use MP3's as ringtones through a little trick.  One think I like...this phone is loud!!  I can hear it ringing in a crowded shopping mall even.  The vibrate feature works well enough and can be activated quickly (though this requires you to flip open the phone).The camera is located where the hinge of the flip would be and rotates so you can snap a pic of yourself without contorting your face and arms to face the lens.  You can also change some pic settings like black and white and sepia tones etc.  The camera is quite decent for a VGA cell phone camera.  There is a flash though this is rather useless except for close up pics.  The camera also lets you take 15 sec video clips which you can save and email to your friends.  While I figured I'd never use this feature I have twice already.  The advantages of having the camera/video in something you always carry is quite nice...it's fine for candid moments and though your friends might know you have a camera phone they won't probably guess you're video recording them. :DThe call quality is niceloud and clear...much better than my old cell phone. Battery life for me has been approx. 5 days with light usage and charges in a little over 2 hrs.  Mind you the old blue versions of this phone had a charging plug near the data port...the new black face ones charge straight through the data port.The holster that came with mine (the black vx7000) was great...solid and not cheapy like some phones are.  Notice that the face of the phone flashes colored led's near the flash when you receieve a call or are making one...some like it some don't.I like the phone and it's size is deceptive. Tonight I showed it to a friend and she said that thing is huge!..then we compared it to her Panasonic camera phone and she noticed...hers was bigger lol.  This is one of Verizon's best cell phones right now...highly recommended.
4	GuysI have used several of my friends bluetooth headsets (motorolas and jabras) and had decided I didn't want one.  Then I found the Mobile Freedom and read the reviews.  I know Logitech and have used a lot of their stuff with good results so I tried it.  IT DOES EVERYTHING YOU HAVE READ!!  It's quiet in the wind it's battery lasts for days for me it's easy to use easy to pair and the sound quality is awesome!!  Nobody could ever tell I was using a headset.  It takes a bit to get used to the ear clip but once you do there are no problems.  It may be a bit heavier and larger than some but then those little tiny ones that look so chic also have TERRIBLE reviews and TERRIBLE performance!!  Try it out you won't regret it.
2	I get significant transmission static with this headset with my I-mate Sp3i unless I point the phone directly at the headset from a few feed away. It has static if I put the phone in my shirt pocket! Since I haven't done a baseline test of the phone with other bluetooth headsets I can't say if it is the headset or the phone but either way if you buy one of these and have the same problem make sure and return it within the return period.Another problem is the plastic ear holder (the part that holds the headset to your ear). This is a bad design and honestly there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear. The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so. Avoid this headset if you want wear a headset for extended periods of time.A final note: The wind blocking technology works well but at the expense of a high quality sound transmission to your recipent. I've asked a few of my techno-geek-friends when I'm talking to them with the headset and they all say that the sound quality seems to be missing a full dynamic range.Good luck!
4	I bought the Logitech after reading numerous reviews on various brands.  I use the device with a Motorola V551 phone (Cingular).  It works geat!  It charges very quickly and the charger folds up in a compact fashion when not in use (the electrical prongs fold up into a recess in the charger). The unit holds a charge for a long time.  I left it in a drawer for a month pulled it out and it was still ready to go!I use the device a couple of times a month on business when driving etc.  The windscreen is outstanding and cuts out noise even when driving with the window open.  some people complain about the ear piece.  It seems fine to me and you can adjust it easily but keep in mind any headset is an annoyance when you first wear one.  Then it becomes second nature.the sound is great the phone detects the device quickly its fairly comfortable. All it all it performs just like a device twice its price
4	I have a Motorola Razr phone and I absolutely hate it because it has low hearing volume and bad reception resulting in missed calls.  I was seriously planning on returning/selling it until I got this Freedom headset!It makes a huge difference!  Very lightweight and comfortable!  No problems with range or battery life.  A little bulky though.  Just got it the other day and a must buy especially at $40 with $10 rebate = $30!!
4	Its the only bluetooth headset I've used so I don't have anything to compare it with.  Has made my ipaq 6315 much more usable as a phone.  Sound quality is good some people say I sound far away I'm experimenting with the gain on the ipaq we'll see if that helps.  It was a little tight for me at first (big ears) I was able to bend the part that goes around the ear a little and its much better now.  Great battery life.Would be nice to have an external ringer on it so I could hear it ringing or vibrate if I were away from the phone.  Good range 15-30'.
4	i had bought the motorola HS820 before this one for $80. i have a motorola V505 from at&t.; the motorola worked pretty well but i thought $80 for a bluetooth headset was way too much. i returned the motorola and picked up the logitech instead and for 1/2 the cost i was just as happy.it fits a little awkwardly on my ear but so did the motorola so i am thinking my ears are the problem. call clarity and voice recognition is good. battery life is good. weight on ear is good. overall i am pretty impressed!i wish there was some way to adjust the tightness of the earpiece as it feels kind of loose on my ear. would also be nice if the on button wasn't so small that you covered it up with your finger when you turned it on making it hard to see the flashing blue light.whenever i use my microwave it makes the bluetooth connection drop. just warning ya'. ;)
4	I've been using this headset for a few months and couldn't be more pleased with the battery life. It recently had no problems keeping up with a four hour Skype session!It is also capable of pairing with multiple devices so you can for instance use it with your computer at home and your cell phone on the road without having to redo the pairing every time something cheap brand-X headsets don't do.Logitech was kind enough to supply a very tiny charger perfect if you take your headset on the road. For those international trips no problem: it can handle 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz (translation for the technologically challenged: you can use it anywhere in the world just get a cheap prong adapter)On the negative side it's possible to jam the connector into the headset the wrong way if you're not careful. Of course the battery won't charge up and the light won't go on a dead giveaway. It caused no damage to my headset but the connector design could be better.I found this headset very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The volume is loud and the sound quality is very clear. People on the other side liked the sound quality as well.There are a few negative points that cost this otherwise excellent headset a star:* after 10 minutes of inactivity it goes to low-power mode sleep. When the phone it is paired with rings it may take up to 5 rings for it to wake up and start ringing. If you press the answer button before the headset starts ringing you will lose the call. If you want to answer right away you can always answer on the phone but if you do so pressing the answer button on the headset will not transfer the call to the headset like it did on my Sony Ericsson HBH headset but hang up. To transfer the call to the headset use the appropriate menu on the phone instead.* The ring on the headset is an irritating non-modifiable melody. It would be nice to have a few options!* The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks don't forget that this is a very capable well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price one of the best out there. If you can live with the looks it's a super deal.
0	the behind the ear thing just broke...I baby my stuff and treat it VERY lightly and this piece of junk just fell apart!!!Very dissapointed!!!I should have made my additions to this review long ago but Logitech cam through for me on this headset in a huge way! They immediately sent me a replacement of the headset but not just a replacement an $85 replacement! Then told me to keep the broken one which I was able to fix with some Krazy Glue!Really incredible customer support...I will never hesitate to buy something branded with the Logitech name!BTW 5 stars on the earpiece itself once it was repaired with the glue.
2	I'm a great believer in spending as little as possible on glitzbells and whistles and generally go for performance and practicality. Sound quality and features are fine for the price.  But the unit is quite difficult to wear -- the boom is wide and boxy; the weight is unbalanced as well.  I could not get a comfortable fit.  My ear is well within normal range of size and shape but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here.  If you don't care about medium to long term fit and comfort or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear you may be happy with this headset.  I wasn't and am returning it.  I'm going to give the Cardo Scala a try;  if it's no good I'll probably go with a Jabra and spend a bit more money.
4	I've had this for about a year.  It works great.  Great call quality no static.  Battery life is real good.  The only bad part is this looks like a part of a males anatomy and I don't really want that on my head.  Otherwise great buy.
4	Let me say a few things:Buy THIS device.  Here are the reasons:- 7-8 Hours talk time- True 30 feet range- Wind filter for clear talking- Small and comfortable doesn't intrude your ear- Crazy price huge quality- Warranty and reliability of Logitech!I've used a Sony Ericsson and Jabra BT200 and I would say the Jabra is much better than Sony Ericsson but the Logitech blows them both away.  It's faster to put on the Logitech and the range is much better.  The microphone is clear and crisp and the speaker volume is loud and sufficient.For me I used a Jabra A210 bluetooth adapter for a Sprint Sanyo 8100 phone w/2.5mm headset jack.  It gave me BT on my phone so I could use this headset.  The auto-answer and hang up depends on your phone whether it would normally do so with a headset or not.  Works great for me!If you are considering a headset get this one.  It's what bluetooth technology should be like.  It's so great that Amazon sold out...  nice.  It was $39.99 (where did they all go???)
4	I was a bit skeptical when I saw the price and read some reviews but I thought hey its Logitech it must be good.  I was right this headset is very comfortable compared to another headset I just bought.  The ear speaker is loud even to the point that I don't have to have it on the highest setting.  The mic was the thing I was worried about though so I called my friend's cell phone and talked to myself and I was pleasantly surprised with the sound volume and clarity.  Also I haven't had any complaints from other friends I've talked to with the headset.  It has been my experience that Logitech makes the best wireless devices for the buck and they didn't let me down with this one (second Logitech wireless devices in two month; I also bought their xbox controller which is definitely also worth the buy.)
0	The sound quality was excellent but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering poor mechanical engineering.I loved it when it wasn't broken.  Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech.
4	I have used it now for 2 weeks with a RAZR V3 and I am satisfied it works as advertised. It was very easy to pair the headset with the phone. The sound is good even in noisy environments. The headset is light confortable and fits well.My only complaint is about the smart button used to turn on/off answer dial and pair. The button is also a LED indicator. The LED flashes diferently (different colors intervals) for various modes but it is difficult to see the LED while pushing and holding the button. After a few days I got used to it and now I know how long to hold the button down to switch on/off pair or use voice dial.At $42 it is a good deal.
4	very cheap excellent value. the problem with most is their uselessness when confronted by windy conditions- this does a much better job than most. v simple instructinos though it lacks the ability to switch easily between headset & phone & back.nevertheless at $35 or under brilliant value.
2	Pros:- Price- Ease of pairing- Sound quality (yours and theirs)- Battery lifeCons- Painful for an extended time (10 mins)- Hard to tell if on or off
4	I bought the Logitech Mobile Freedom Headset (980228-0403) for use with VoIP on my HP zt3000 Windows XP SP2 notebook. I wanted to use a wireless headset and VoIP to make international calls mostly from hotel rooms. This headset did not work out of the box for my situation. The Logitech support website was great. It said to upgrade the notebook's bluetooth software. The HP site was also excellent. I downloaded bluetooth and many other newer drivers. Once installed the headset immediately worked as docuemented. The other newer drivers solved all the weird hibernation problems I've been experiencing too. I'm using Skype for VoIP service. Skype setup has an option for using the bluetooth headset for Skype only otherwise the normal audio devices are used. All in all installation was a bit of upgrade work but competently supported. I now have a VoIP connected wireless headset that allows me mobile freedom. Due to my usage I have no comment on the audio quality or useability with mobile phones. The device apparently will not work with the majority of PocketPCs due to a lack of bluetooth software. Thus I only gave it 4 stars. However HP does sell stereo headphones (no microphone) for most IPaq models.Update: 15-March-2005 Am able to pair with Axim x50v PocketPc. Has considerable static. Skype and other apps nearly unusable. Continues to work with XP well. Suggest Plantronics MX100I Stereo Headset for using Skype on a PPC.
4	Got this headset to replace my Jabra (which was incompatable with my Nokia 3650). Fit and comfort is extremely subjective but I found the Jabra to be far more comfortable (I would actually forget I was wearing it); that said this unit is not uncomfortable (until after a couple hours) just not nearly AS comfortable or securely fitting.Very few complaints as far as performance. It was easy to pair with my phone my wife's Motorola V3 and even my laptop. Sound quality is clear for both parties (recipients occasionally complained of a pinging noise with the Jabra) and the noise reduction actually works to eliminate wind noise. Battery life is excellent. The single function can be a little aggrevating (especially when trying to turn it off as you have to hold it down for a long time). The only weird and very rare quirk is occassionally calls will be interrupted with a strange sound that sounds like someone dropping a manhole cover as it spins on pavement - very strange very annoying and fortunately very rare.Overall performance is top notch comfort is acceptable and value is difficult to beat.
4	I have been using this for a month.PROS:It is a good value.  It works really well and it lasts a very long time on a charge.  The WindStop feature works very well.  People have been able to hear me very well while driving and even while playing volleyball.  It stays on the ear well but is not uncomfortable.CONS:The unit looks okay but is less attractive than some of the other high-tech units on the market.  3 of my co-workers have commented that it looks like I am wearing a phallic symbol on my ear which is really not the look I would like to achieve.
4	Because I spent a lot of time on the phone I am very particular about BT headsets.  I have tried every brand of BT headset you can imagine I mean EVERY brand.  I was so frustrated to a point I was ready to go back to wired headset until I ran into this little guy.  This is by far the best one hands down.  My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola.  I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance.  I don't understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month.  Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise.  Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset you end up with wind noise car noise AC noise every kind of noise but your voice.  In additional the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to get off your crappy Jabra BT headset or take me off your Motorola BT headset.  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it's a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem the sound quality is amazing by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit but it's really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out there is a correct way to wear this and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can't speak for all but I personally don't wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it's behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.  I am sure customers that raved about Jabra would rank this unit out of this world!
4	Good reception. It fits OK on my ear but not perfectly. It seems sturdy. Price was better than most. The wind doesn't bother it much either.
4	We bought the Plantronics HL10 Handset Lifter to go with ourPlantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headsetand have been very pleased with both devices. Using the handset lifter give you the ability to answer calls directly from the wireless headset which is good if you spend a lot of time away from the physical phone to which the headset unit is connected.Setup was amazingly easy just following the directions allowed us to get this installed in just a few minutes on our very inexpensive no-name speaker phone.Like our Plantronics Headset this has passed the test of time and I would buy a new one if it failed today.Highly Recommended!CFH
4	This device allows me to answer incoming calls on my NEC phone while I roam the office with my Plantronics wireless headset in place. This headset already has enough wireless range to cover half the floor in my building so the ability to answer the phone at such a distance is extremely useful in a bunch of situations. A couple of key features:When a call comes in either Intercom or from an external line there is a chime in my ear that alerts me to the call. I can then press the single button on the headset and the receiver is lifted allowing me to receive the call.When the call is done I press the single button again and the receiver hangs up.It's about as simple as conceivably possible.The install instructions were however less than perfect. To get this to work properly I have to unplug the phone base from the handset and in to the Plantronics unit. The handset is then plugged in to the Plantronics unit. This was not explicitly stated in the install instructions. It took 10-15 minutes to figure out the trick. Once that was worked out however everything has been perfect.The only thing that I cannot easily do is pick up parked calls as there is no function to select a line. I can live with that shortcoming.
4	First of all I must start out by saying that I am a little surprised that this little mechanical device is even necessary with all of the technological advances out there these days.  The HL-10 is kind of a throw back to the seventies in terms of its jerry rigging function.  Having said this...  Plantronics builds quality stuff and I am sure that there is a good reason for it.  The device does exactly what it is supposed to do once you adjust it for your individual phone.  I was a little concern that it would fit my phone but they include plenty of adjustment options to take care of any setup.  I am using it with a Plantronics CS351N  headset - which I love for it professional wireless function.  I tested the HL-10 by picking up/hanging up the headset 10 times in sucession and the lifter raised and lowered the receiver successfully each time.  That was good enough for me.  Definitely worth the $ if you own a wireless headset and you roam around the house/office while talking on the phone.
2	There isn't much to say here.  For the phone system I have this was needed to enable the remote functions of the  Plantronics-CS540 Convertible Wireless Headset.  It could be more aesthetically-pleasing but as I'm sure it's designed for a wide variety of phones that need a remote lifter I suppose you can't complain.Mounting the unit can be tricky.  You need to be certain it will work properly before you use the sticky tape to mount it in place.  So you wind up holding it with one hand while working your headset to activate/deactivate it several times to be sure you've found the right spot for it.Comes with a special headset adapter for phones with shapes that offset the lifter bar.
4	Charger works greatand charges your phone really quick! I love that it lights up too so you know when it's plugged in!
4	Walk into your local Wireless store and you will find this on the shelf for 3-4 times the price on Amazon! This product is a genuine Motorola accessory easily identifiable by the cable tag and M logo. Not only does the product look nice with a glowing blue LED but it works very quickly and had no issue being detected by my phone. Buy this now one for your car your spouse's car and a backup!
4	Ive gone through so many car chargers this is the best one and its sooooo fast.
4	I have purchased many car charges for my phones - and this is the only one that hasn't broken. I love that the blue light shows you when it's working - no guessing! Great gadget for very little money!
4	Great spare charger for my motorcycle. Fits in the spare compartment to keep my phone charged while I'm riding. Like the lit up area to show that it's plugged in.
4	I got this to help charge a tablet keyboard but was excited to find it worked to charge all sorts of items that accepted the mini USB.
4	My Nexus 5 recognizes this charger as an AC source. As a result it can charge at the maximum rate possible. Works great when using my phone for navigation and BT audio streaming.
4	this is the first and only car charger I have found that can keep up with my galaxy s 3 while I am using GPS and playing music
4	Rather than wait a month for Verizon to send a welcome kit; I needed a charger ASAP.  The charger was a Motorola charger that was half the price of the one at the local cellphone store and it was the brandname charger. It works well has a bright large indicator light when it is plugged in.  A further surprise it also fits my car hands free so I can charge one or the other with the same charger.  Good deal and quality
4	Got this charger for my mom for a Christmas stocking stuffer and she loves it.  The design is nice it seems well-made and doesn't feel like flimsy plastic.  For the price you can't beat a buy like this.  (Why did I spend $35 for my own charger again?)
4	I luv this charger.  The blue light helps u see it's charging in aux jack.  Fits my Motorola ATRX perfectly even with Otterbox defender case on it
4	I've been using this thing to charge my Nokia and Samsung Galaxy Note 2 devices....it charges them very quick....Love it.
4	Had no issues loved this charger worked great and lasted a beating I gave it and charged my phone quicker then regular chargers
4	First I like the blue glow this charger puts off. (Others have expressed disdain).Second it charges my phone extremely fast. And really that's the important thing eh?I highly recommend this to anybody requiring an inexpensive yet useful car charger for their phone.
4	The charger works well.  When it is plugged in and drawing power the disc turns blue.  Nice little feature.
4	I have ordered cheap chinese rip off chargers and figured I should actually spend some money to get a real charge. This one actually works well and charges my phone when I use the GPS. Other chargers I have had the phone still loses power!
4	Buy this before supplies runs out because this is a very good value. The light is very appealing and it functions very efficiently. I have purchased two of these.
4	This car Charger does what its suppose to and charges my Galaxy s 3 just fine The Light it gives off is great and the price is low so I recommend to all.
4	The blue illumination is cool. Matches the interior lighting of my infiniti well. It charges the latest micro USB phones fairly quickly. I docked one star bc the giant blue illuminating M can be slightly obtrusive. But I guess thats a small price to pay for decent effect. Overall I highly recommend this charger for style quickness and price!
4	Arrived 2 days earlier than stated ETA packaged nicely charger is one of the nicer units I've seen for any phone. Works as described great product.
4	The cord is long and the blue light is okay but this does charge my phone fast for being just a car charger
4	When I first bought my phone I didn't buy a car charger - didn't think I'd need it. Unfortunately I went to work one day only to discover I only had a 30% charge. I had to leave my phone off unless I needed to make a call. My wife ordered me this charger the same day - it fits both the phone and my car. I might never need it but it's nice to know that I have it if I need it.
4	This is my second Motorola charger and I hope it works as well as my first which I had for almost 3 years. There isn't much to say that has not been said about it already and I charge anything with a usb port through it without any problems.
4	Not much to say that hasn't been said already. This is pretty much the best car charger on the market! I've got 2 and they look really nice are built well and work great. They definitely put my Verizon AT&T; and Sprint branded chargers to shame which have a difficult time charging with the screen on and GPS running. With the P518 I can have the phone blazing with everything imaginable running and it still charges. At a 1 amp charge capacity it's fast too. Not like charge your phone from dead to full in 10 minutes fast but faster than all the others I've tried.The only downside (if you can even call it a downside) is the blue light is a bit bright at night. Not like staring into the sun bright but still somewhat bright. I actually love how it looks so it's of no hindrance to me. Also it sticks out a bit further than most chargers so if your lighter receptacle is in a tight place you may want to consider this. But I personally haven't run into any vehicles where it was a problem.Definitely recommended.
4	Great quality. Much better and sturdier than the other after market ones I have purchased in the past. Definitely worth the two extra dollars!
4	Well designed.  High power (1.0 Amp) so it can recharge your phone more quickly. Fits my car's cigarette lighter plug snugly and stays in.  The bright blue light is a bit much but I'm getting used to it.  Cord could be longer.  Fits any phone that needs a micro-USB charger cable.  High quality construction.  Buy this -- you won't regret it.Warning: some phones like the Galaxy S3 won't charge well if the supplied amperage is not at least 1.0 Amps.  Often the amperage is not specified in the listings -- buyer beware.
4	Yep like this item - ended up getting a second one.  Like the LED and the fact that it's a name brand. Works great.
4	This is a great fast charger by Motorola. It's increasingly trickier to determine if something sold on Amazon or elsewhere is genuine product or not. OEM isn't sufficient anymore and most of the non brand name stuff is junk. Be sure to buy by Motorola (or whatever your brand is - but Motorola will work for most) and these are now half a ten spot on Amazon and lots more in the store.My one complaint and reason for dinging a star is that the cord is way too short for use in most vehicles. It's fine for a non smart phone sitting in the console or a cup holder - but it's far too short for smart phone use with the phone positioned on or near the dashboard. I've been unable to find a micro-micro usb extension so I may switch to an power adapter with a socket and just use a long regular usb cable.
4	Worked well and I love the blue light as it lets me know it is actually plugged in and working.
4	I have a Galaxy Nexus and my wife has a Samsung Droid Charge phone and we use this as our charger of choice in both of our cars.  I've bought several different type of generic knock off chargers in the past.  Some that did work but broke easily and some that were so poorly made that they wouldn't charge my phone at all.  This Motorola made charger does a great job of charging my phone.  Even if I am streaming music via Bluetooth to my car and using my phone as a GPS the charger is still able to overcome the power drain and keep the battery charging.  If I had to make one nitpick its the bright blue logo that is lit up while its plugged in.  Its not overpoweringly bright but its unnecessary in my opinion.  Despite this I still think this is the best value for a cell phone charger out there.  Highly recommended!
4	I bought 3 of these for an EVO 4g and a Win 7 phone. My Evo uses juice like no other and using all the tricks in the world still doesnt get me to 1 pm when streaming Rhapsody at work. So at lunch I can leave my Evo plugged in and it charges it pretty quick. It probably takes about 30-45 min to fully charge my Evo from 5% battery left using juicedefender which in self is little miracle app.
4	I'm amazed on how fast this would charge my phone. I thought it was a gimmick on the rapid charge but its not. I can leave my girl's house at 15% battery by the time I'm home it has 80% charge. We live about 35 miles apart. ***Update when I bought this I was using it for my old Motorola Photon 4G phone now I own a Samsung Galaxy S3 it's rapid charge not effective as it was with the Photon but it still does the job. I still like the feature of the blue light that glows once you plug it in to the 9V lighter port. Would be nice to have an indicator to show full charge/charging mode. Hopefully it'll be a nice addition to newer chargers.
4	I searched and searched for an affordable car charger for my new Samsung Galaxy S3 and then I stumbled on this one. I read the reviews to see if anyone tried it with an S3 and I saw quite a few positive reviews. I bought it for less than $5 and gave it a try. It worked great and charged my phone pretty quickly even while using GPS and streaming music. I think that this device puts out about 950 mah which is adequate for most phones. One of the reasons it works so well is because my phone detects it as an AC charger allowing for a better and faster charge. Plus this device looks nice and lights up blue when plugged in. I would definitely recommend it. I actually just bought a second one because I like it so much.
4	Price is right.  Works fine and is durable.  The thumb handle may be the key.  Easy in....easy out and stays in place.  Great for my Android
4	Just what we needed and the cost was perfect!  My husband took it with him to his job and uses it there.
4	I am using this vehicle charger in a work provided Astro van. I purchased this after my upgrade to a Samsung Galaxy SII. I originally bought cheap cig lighter to USB adapters but one of them popped a fuse on the Astro. I threw it away and bought this higher quality device. When it is receiving power from the car the round end where the cable attaches to glows a soft blue color. The cord has a built in simple management system. the two ends of coiled area snap together. It bundles the cord a little and helps to keep it out of the way not by a lot but a little and every little bit helps in a car. The power output is lower than wall charger provided by Samsung but adequate. After the cheap adapter blew a fuse I decided not to put something in the work van that could damage the van further and I believe this is a quality product.
4	I'm using this with my Galaxy S3 and it works great plus it's the fastest car charger I've ever owned.
4	Works exactly as expected. No hassles and no need to fiddle around with the charger. The charger fits easily into the socket.
4	This is probably the BEST car charger on the market. If you are in the market for a good car charger this is the one.
4	I bought this to replace a Verizon brand charger. I have a HTC phone and this works great. I can actually use the navigation on 4G and it will still charge. My last charger would only slow down the battery drain if I used navigation or 4G services but it would still drain on long trips. This charger also feels very sturdy and build quality is superb.
4	Works great with my GS3 looks from the future and the cable is awesome. Great way to take your smartphone to the next level.
4	This was a great buy!  The cord is longer than others I have seen which is convenient.  The blue light is neat but doesn't mean anything.  It does not turn color or turn off when the phone is fully charged.  It just indicates that the charger is inserted into the lighter correctly.
4	The price is unbelievable for a genuine Motorola product.  Works great!  I always make sure that when buying things like this they are legit and not fakes as others have said make sure you buy from Amazon.
4	Seems to be working well so far. Used it for a few days and haven't had any problems. I will update if anything changes.
4	I have a Saab and a lot of chargers don't work play nice with the lighter.This charger had no problem. From my vendor the product was authentic.
4	This charger was purchased with the expectation that it would charge my phone fast. It has met my expectation I forgot to charge my phone before going to bed. The next morning I got in the car plugged in my phone using this charger by the time I reached my my destination 20 mins away from my home my phone was more than half way charged that more than met my expectations. I would consider using this seller again. Item arrived in the condition and at the time time described.
4	would recommed this item for anyone that drives for a living and needs to comminicate while driving.  Keeps the bluetooth ear bug charged for use daily.
4	Brought this to go in our second car so we wouldn't have to carry the one we had from car to car works very well
4	I like the cool blue Motorola accent that lights up when it is plugged in. It charge's my phone quicklywhich is a nice. I also like the extra long cord or there is a plastic clip to make it shorternice.
4	this charger works just prefect for my Note 2!!!!! i had looked into the New Trent Arcadia Rapiduo and the New trent (1pc) car chargers i was reading mixed reviews some said that the chargers worked good but you had to purchase a different usb cable for charging so that the voltage would be at 2.0 which is what the Note 2 needs so i realized my husband owned to of these motorola chargers after reading great reviews saying that it worked perfect on their Notes i quickly when to my car and tried them out and they work perfectly!!! go to your phone settings and then go to battery and while its charging the phone should say AC which means its charging at a 2.0v if it says USB then it too low for the Note2 anyway it worked great!! and was charging at the proper voltage. anyway im super happy no need to worry about purchasing extra usb cables or anything like that and oh yeah they had the holograms meaning they are legit motorola products not the knock offs beware of that!
4	I've had a lot of trouble finding a charger that will do anything but hold the battery steady on my AT&T; Captivate (a Samsung Galaxy S phone) while being used for GPS and with the screen on.. and finally this one does it. It also does not present itself as a real USB device (many chargers show up as a connected computer) which is great.Only downside for me is the fixed cord (can't substitute cords for other devices) but for the cost of this it's well worth one per car.
4	This charger does charge fast and the quality is excellent for the price.  The coil cord is nice and it never gets twisted.  One thing I did experienced was that if you have it plugged in the wrong angle it falls off time to time.
4	Good cheap car charger that looks good as well. Most chargers I seen were either to high or to cheaply made this one is a good pick.
4	This is the original product not a fake imitation. I bought two one for each car.With this being an OEM product I don't have to worry about this unit ruining my phone or Bluetooth.
4	Very quick delivery.... looks great when plugged in and charging...exceptionally fast in it s ability to charge. I would suggest that you get this one while they last. It would be a good deal at twice the price.
4	This is only a 1 amp charger and does work very well.  And you know it looks cool with the light up Motorola logo.....really cool.But be forewarned it will NOT fast charge a Galaxy Note 2......it will charge faster than a standard USB charge........but not as fast as a 2 amp charger.  And if you are using your Note 2 as a GPS it will barely maintain the current charge.  If used normally it will charge but just not real fast.
4	It lights up blue when it's charging and it's a super rapid charge.  Fits all my Android phones perfectly - reaches full charge in about 35 minutes.  Great buy!
4	I got it for my cell and it's been working fine for years now. This cable has outlasted 5 cellphones and 4 cars. Not bad.
4	Great for the price.No problems as some others have stated. Worked for over a year now no sign of a decline in performance.My phone can be navigating on a phone call (or streaming music) and this keeps the battery even or even building (Samsung Galaxy S4).Great buy I'd buy one for a friend if needed!
4	Good quality. I like the blue light that lights up when you plug it in that way you know that it is charging.
4	Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate ChargerMotorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate ChargerGreat charger on the car
4	good price and works great for my samsung galaxy s4 also has a nice blue light indicator love it :D
4	Not much to say but it does what it's needs to do and it's cheat and it looks good! Will buy again.
4	I have had no issues with this charger.  I had one just like this that was issued with my work BB so I had no hesitation in picking up another one for my personal phone.  From all I can tell this is the real deal and not a counterfeit.  Works great!
4	I never realized how much the amperage output of a charger mattered until I got this and my S4's oem charger.It's only 1amp but that's a LOT better than the average car charger. It's not a miracle worker but it definitely pumps juice back into just about any smart device you might have at a great rate.Now if i could just find more legit OEM Samsung chargers with the 2amp output :)
4	I bought this originally for my Sprint Evo 3D.  It does exactly what it should and feels like a quality product.  I originally bought an el cheapo cigarette lighter charger online and it fell apart after 5 months of light use.  This one feels much more sturdy than any I have ever owned.  Also at night gives a cool blue effect from the lighted up part.  It's not really bright so it won't affect your driving/blind you at night.  The cable is very long so you don't have to worry about it being too short.  Great product.  I recently purchased the Sprint Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works perfectly with it.
4	I bought this to replace the one I bought from Verizon several yrs ago. It is great just like the other one I had.
4	Purchased this charger with no problems yet.  After a second purchase for my son whom does a lot of traveling
4	I was looking for a car charger that wasn't cheap but didn't break the bank either. You can forget getting that anywhere retail. So I searched on trusty Amazon.I know from past experiences of myself and others...that a bad car phone charger can ruin your phone...so I was hesitant with all the cheap no name knock offs.Then I saw this one. A true blue Motorola brand charger! Plus at the time of purchase(5/25/11) it was sold and shipped from Amazon. As of today(6/7/11) it is not sold or shipped by Amazon.When I ordered it it arrived on time and I tried it right away. It works perfectly. Plus I like the nifty blue logo when it's plugged in. I've seen a couple of reviews saying they received a knock off version when they ordered from the seller I did. Mine was the real thing. It has the Motorola original product sticker...plus you could tell it was well made.I highly recommend this item.
4	I have ordered 4 of these now.  One for each car and two as gifts.  They work great and do what they should.  No issues on my end.  I have had mine for well over a year now.  Just picked up one for my mother because ours work so well.  Don't pay retail at the cell phone store.  Buy this and save some cash.
4	It does what it is supposed to do but it is really bright during night hours and a bit distracting.
4	Its cheap and it works thats the most important thing. I've had mine for two years now and its still working and it looks pretty good.
4	I use this in my vehicle almost every day and it is a fine charger.It is very stylish as it has a Moto logo with a backlight that turns on when you connect it people always ask about it when they see it and they like it.I use it to charge my good old Atrix 4G and it has a small problem. If you connect it when your battery is under 15% the low batt warning on the phone starts going crazy and you will see as if the charger is connected and disconnected many times. It is annoying but the phone charges anyway so i live with it.I am not sure if this is a phone or charger problem.
4	Charges phone up quickly. Don't always have time to wait for a regular charge time.  I appreciate  having the product.
4	There's not much to say about this charger other than it works and works well!  The little plastic piece on the lighter plug lights up in a cool blue glow.  Remember to unplug it when you get out of your car so a thief isn't enticed by the glow and breaks out your window.
4	I bought this for my Samsung Epic 4G (the 1st gen Galaxy S not the new Epic 4G Touch) since the genuine Sprint charger I bought would not charge properly. It feels nice and sturdy and I have it plugged into a socket hidden inside my center console so the light doesn't bother me. It works great charging my Epic 4G. If it goes low enough again I might buy a spare.Update 1-2-2012:After 5 months of nearly daily usage in my car I'm happy to stay it's still running great. I bought a spare which I keep in my trunk for the day this one eventually dies but since that hasn't happened I'm very happy and will definitely stick with this model for as long as I have micro-usb phones.Update 5-14-2012:Still working great! I haven't had any problems that I can remember.
4	I purchased this to go with my Nexus S after I had gone through three Samsung OEM chargers before it.  The Samsung OEM charger is junk.  The connector always broke and would fit loosely in the micro USB port on the phone.  This Motorola charger also charges the phone quicker.  So if you're debating between the two go with this one.
4	Like the fact that it's the correct brand and milliamps to charge my smart phone. It charges fast and the blue LED light design looks neat.
4	Very impressed with it is exactly what I would have had to pay $40 for on the website. its not a knock off it is the real Motorola. Well worth the money. It charges the phone very fast in about an hour.
4	I got this about a day after i ordered it loved the fast service. I tried it and it works great i love the blue light its so pretty & it charges my droid pro faster than the charger i use in the house! It fits great in my '07 honda civic & my '00 camry would definitely recommend this to anyone!
4	I'm not entirely certain of the rapid rate of which the product claims to have but it does charge my phone at a reasonable rate
4	I needed to replace one of my car chargers because it was wearing out. I bought this to try it out and liked it so much I bought enough for my other vehicles. Hard to beat for the price. The only downside is the blue LED is kind of bright.
4	I got this to replace the one I lost(actually I think when I was getting my car washed it walked out) but..This one was a good price and a nice replacement it was better then the one that I lost/stolen.. Get it!  At this price you can't go wrong..
4	I love this thing it charges my Evo where others have failed. The light is not super bright at night either so it's not blinding.
4	I use this to charge my phone while I use it as a gps. It works as intended and it is stylish on top of that.
4	I searched long and hard to find a quality charger for my phone. I have numerous vehicles and it is a drag trying to remember to take the charger from one car to another. So I decided to get one for each car. This proved more difficult than I thought. There are more cheap charges out there than good ones. So buyer beware but this is a good one. The only flaw is that It doesn't charge as rapidly as the original but other than that it works great.
4	This is very well built unit but it would be perfect if it had another slot for another USB where two people could charge at the same time. With that said it is one of the best built unit I have purchased from Amazon and I would give it 8 stars if it had a second USB plug.
4	Charges quickly build quality is good and it has a cool blue light that adds a nice glow to the car interior.  This is a much better value than the other cheap chargers on Amazon and Ebay.  Buy one for each car and a few as gifts. :-)
4	I have had this product for at least 3 months.My cell several times alerted for chargingnearly dead and I charged it for 15 minutesand the battery would be on half or 3/4charged. Very Fast!!!! Awesome.....
4	I like the power of this charger. It does charge quickly and my phone can be use as soon as I plug it in. Great quality.
4	Although the style is cool with a blue light up and is very cheap... the plug into the phone became wobbly within my HTC Incredible so the phone only recognized it some of the time.  However since it's so cheap I replaced it with another.
4	I needed a car charger. I bought this one. Works fine it charges my phone like its supposed to. The blue LED light is fancy. Shipping was fast
4	The best car charger I've ever purchased its a rapid charger and ill most likely order more. I recommend you get this charger.
4	I needed a bungie style micro-usb to 12-v car adapter. This fit the bill perfectly and even has a status light when charging. Great product high quality.
4	It is a very rapid charger compared to the others out there.  It was a very good pruchase for the price.
4	Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate Charger works great and has a good wire length for smart phone uses. I can setup my smart phone for GPS using charger power source with plenty of wire. Reaches to either side of the cab for co-pilot use. A great OEM charger at a great price.
4	My folks just got new cell phones and needed a micro usb charger for their car.  This unit is solid and nice light with good price.
4	This is a very sturdy charger and I use it all the time with no problem.  The top of the charger lights up when the car is on but because it is a closed compartment the light doesn't affect my driving or distract me.
4	Good price for this adapter.  I have one already provided by my company but got another one for my daughter to charge up her phone and another daughter has one in her car.  They are very reliable.
4	Lasted almost a year (so far).It's the most durable charger I've purchased. The ends haven't degraded noticeably still providing a reliable charge.
4	I love this speed charger!!! It looks really classy in a new vehicle and it charges my Galaxy phone super quick.
4	Got this for my Sprint HTC Evo and has worked great the handful of times I've used it so far.  Not sure how long it would take it to charge it to full but the connector fits great and it seems to hold a steady charge even when using Google Navigation which is all I really got it for.
4	this charger i use all the time to charge my phone not even that but my nexus 7 !as you know nexus 7 needs to have alot of battery charging power to charge a powerful device
4	It doesn't charge very much at all while running Google Navigation on my Galaxy S3. It will keep up and charge about 4% an hour.  I have a cheapo Luxmo charger that charges 10% an hour while running Navigation.  But this charger is only rated 950mah and does work so it stays in my wife's car.I did receive what appears to be a genuine Motorola product otherwise I would give it 3 stars.  I don't think this thing is really 950mah. I have a 500mah Blackberry charger and it works the same as this one.  Find the cheap Luxmo 1 amp charger.  It really is 1 amp.
4	Amazon sent me the Spanish version in a plastic bag (instead of Motorola packaging) but the specs are the same and the item seems to work fine so far (I've had limited use to date though)for both my Samsung Epic 4G and HTC EVO 4G.
4	Nice reasonably compact sturdy fast charges and a long cord. The durability and performance have been fine.The only thing I don't like is that the logo is pretty bright. I have to turn the adapter so that I don't get distracted by the light at night and even then there's a significant blue glow on my instrument panel.
4	Let's face it every time you get a new cell phone you have to buy a new car charger. So why should you pay top dollar when you know you'll only get enough use out of it until your next upgrade generally two years at the most? But if you spend a few minutes doing your research you'll find this car charger for your Droid Incredible. It's perfect! It has the Motorola branding and the price is about one-fifth what you'd pay at the Verizon store or in a Best Buy.It charges your Incredible pretty quickly. I recently was at 2% battery life. I hooked this charger up went and did my 35 minute workout at the gym. When I returned to my car the battery was at a 94% charge. Not bad.The Incredible is a great smart phone. But all of you owners also know that it really sucks up the battery so it's pretty important that you have a car charger readily available. I highly recommend this one. Not only does it do the job very well the price is right. You will definitely get your money's worth.
4	I needed a new car charger and for $5 and free shipping why not try it. Very sleek charger. I've seen chargers that cost 3 times as much not looks this nice. I love the blue light that illuminates when it's plugged in. It takes the guesswork out for me so I KNOW without a doubt my phone is charging. The length of the charger is more than sufficient. It fits all phones with micro SD connections.As I stated in my review title Buy it you won't regret it!
4	Bought for a Samsung Android phone and works great!  No problems with this charger came in original packaging and the blue Motorola logo that illuminates is cool!  Good price too!
4	not much to say about a car charger but it does its job when my phone died charges it pretty quickly
4	This is one of the best car chargers I have had.  Seems to be built well and love the way it lights up when it has a connection in the plug/outlet
4	the Motorola power adapter charges my droid with the 1800mah battery in 30 min... the light does sometimes get annoying when night driving but its worth it
4	Great product - keeps the Droid X2 charged. Doesn't overheat and looks pretty cool with the blue LED. Also great price....you'd expect to pay $30 for something similar inside the store.
4	I have used this on 3 different phones and it has worked great!!!!  I have owned this for about 2 years now and no complains so far...
4	i bought this over two yrs ago. it worked for me. not much else to say. it was a fair price and a good fit.
4	this screen protector work great just i change them every 3 months thats why i purches more in one package
4	Don't know what other reviewers are seeing. I opened the package cleaned the iphone surface with a moist paper towel first then with a dry napkin (my simple way of cleaning the surface) then cleaned with the cleaning cloth supplied (it all took less than a minute) and applied the screen protector. It went on cleanly with very little bubbles that I could remove with the supplied applicator (a small plastic tool to remove the bubbles).BargainCell promptly shipped them on ordering and I got it in 3 days. More than a week now and so far the screen is holding up well.Update: Two months later and it is still ok - no bubbles and it is sticking to the surface correctly. Great product for a very good price (even the high cost of shipping is worth it) compared to similar products being sold in Fry's for $10 or more.
4	Screen protectors work and can be a bother to put on but once they get there without bubbles they work great.
4	The price was so great I bought 3 so I can replace them whenever I want to.
4	I received this card when I purchased an unlocked phone. Considering I travel a ton this was a nice freebie.Pros:- First of all I have to say that the instructions are very simple to follow. All of my questions were answered by the time I finished reading the two-pager. There is even a great troubleshooting portion at the end.- The rates are about $0.05 per minute cheaper than AT&T; but ultimately it will depend on which countries you visit.- I love the fact that I now have an International Number for whenever I travel. I just pop the SIM card into my Quad-Band phone and I'm all set!- The card was free with purchase of mySony Ericsson W580i Grey Phone (Unlocked).Cons:- None that I can think of.Helpful tips:- The phone number you are assigned is from the UK. It will start with county code 44. If people are going to call you from the US they need to dial 011 44 and then the unique number Mobal assigns you.- Mobal provides a SIM PIN if you wish to lock you phone. It's not required but it will prevent unwanted use if you happen to lose your phone.- The worldwide emergency number is 112. Works just like 911 in the states.- You have to go to special SIM activations site (Amazon wont let me post the actual URL) to activate the SIM card. Once there you need to enter in your SIM card serial number and the phone number that Mobal assigns you. These numbers are all found in the upper-right hand portion of the instruction sheet. This site is also where you register and enter your credit card information.
4	Great SIM card and great customer service from Amazon. I lost this phone during shipment and Amazon was kind enough to replace it. Thank you Amazon! God bless.
4	This SIM is an excellent product to have with you and your unlocked Quad band GSM phone when you travel abroad.The coverage is extensive ( 170+ countries ) no fees no surcharges no minimum charges no taxes no line maintenance fees.Just keep it and use it when you need to. Great as a back-up to another card or for emergency use.The rates are high for most countries so use should be for emergencies or short calls only. If you want to talk a lot use a phone card and a pay phone or buy a local SIM. But for emergency or occasional use you cannot beat it. It is also a good value if you are traveling to the UK as all incoming calls there are free on your cell with this SIM ( UK only ).I would not leave the country without it.
4	I have been using this card for several years. I frequently travel internationally and need short-term access to international roaming which my old cell provider did not offer and my new one charges a monthly fee for. I put this in my phone when I am out of the country and it has been very useful. When I expect high use or an extended stay I buy a separate sim card from a local provider in the country but for occasional use I use this. The per-minute usage charges are very high but if you consider the cost of a sim card for each country this plan is still a good idea for low use. I have also used it for backup when my pre-paid sim card unexpectedly ran out of funds on my last trip ($%^ kids!).I have had good reception; it has worked wherever there was any cell reception.Make sure your phone has a sim card is unlocked and that the frequency will work where you are headed. I always buy unlocked quad-band phones and have had no trouble in Europe Asia Africa S America & N America.
4	We used a Mobal Sat phone when traveling around the world a couple of years back.  Mobal has absolutely _wonderful_ customer service.  Our initial research had shown that we'd be in places without GSM coverage.  Our friends with a UK phone proved us otherwise -- who knew out back in the Masai Mara a GSM phone would work?  The peace of mind was great though.Now when this Mobal SIM card was offered up for free with my N95 purchase I jumped on it.  How could I pass up a free phone number free incoming SMS virtually everywhere and a card that doesn't charge any fees at all?  With this SIM card around I don't have to think about it.  I can just pop it in and go.  No need to learn a new number no need to find out what SIM card actually has good rates etc.Compare this to a buddy who picked up a SIM card to be in France for a month.  The card itself was cheap (maybe $20 -- although that's $10 more than this one).  However the fine print and extra fees ended up making the whole ordeal cost about $1500 for just a couple of hours of use.  This car in France? Only $150 to call back to the US - and no fussing around. If you'd just roamed with AT&T;: $155 plus fees. And back at the Masai Mara for two hours? AT&T;: $478 Mobal: $234.  No guarantees that a local prepaid SIM wouldn't charge huge rates for international calling either.If that still sounds expensive just remember that there are no other fees and it's your phone number.  Additionally remember that you'll not be yacking on the phone like you do back home (you're traveling -- see the sites!)  Even my 2 hour example is excessive for us; we rarely talk more than a couple of minutes when really traveling to get away.This card is highly recommended especially if you can get it bundled.
4	Can't complain. OEM battery. Holds charge. The phone is old but oh well getting some extra life out of it for almost nothing.
4	The battery can last for a week when in standby mode.For normal useit's 3 to 4 days.Still I think how long it can be used depends on how you use it.The time you charge it for first use is important.Alsokeep it from charging to long.That will shorten its life.
4	I had an old Motorola Razor cell phone but it would not charge.  I tried this battery because the price was right and it was an exact replacement for the battery in the phone.  The battery works just fine and holds a charge well.  I thought it might be old battery left around and not work that well but it is brand new and works.  What more can I say.
4	Looking for an OEM replacement...this is it. Works just as good as the orginal battery maybe even better because it is newer than the one that came with your phone
4	I shopped around a bit before deciding on this product. I knew i wasn't taking a chancenot with Amazon guaranty and all so i bought it and it works great
4	This is the original equipment OEM battery for Razors and other vintage motorola phones.  works great charges quickly terrrific price.
4	I am satisfied with this purchase at this price. I searched in few local stores and they told me i wont get it. They told me to buy new phone. I gave a try online and I found this. I m still using my old phone with this new battery. I recommend u to buy this.
4	I used this battery to replace the original one on my old Motorola Krzr. After the replacement it has had a much longer battery life and does not require constant charging like it previously did which is very nice.
4	Great deal for the money. So far seams to last a lot longer compared to the one that came with phone.
4	How does one review a battery?  I charged it up and it worked. It is still working to this very day.  I like OEM products particularly when it comes to batteries.
4	I bought this for my brother.  He says it is working like it should.  It was delivered a day early was very happy about that!  I think it was a great price.
4	I picked this up from the seller SF Planet.  The battery came in just a plastic sleeve but is definitely a new Nokia OEM battery with the official hologram.  Great performance for the few weeks I've had it.
4	Shipped immediately arrived quickly works as advertised. Even under heavy use I cannot tell any difference between this one and the one that came with my phone.
4	Feb 2011: 8-month heavy usage updateContinues to work flawlessly phone holds charge through an hour of conversations an hour of streamed music and an hour of GPS usage daily. I have a charger in the car but never drop below half in a day's worth of heavy use so I usually just charge overnight (or in the car the next morning!)Original Review unchanged (June 2010):After reasonably heavy use over 15-16 months my Nokia 6650 started behaving erratically rebooting spontaneously and indicating low battery seconds after being put into use! This prompted me me to start planning a phone upgrade. Being ineligible for a contract extension upgrade meant that I would be looking for a new phone unlocked at a rather substantial cost. I decided to give this reasonably priced retail Nokia BL-4L battery a whirl first based on the reviews and was thrilled when it gave my phone a new lease of life!Standby and usage times (with 3G browsing music streaming etc for 1-2 hours GPS with Nokia Maps or Google Maps for at least 45 minutes per day and 60-90 minutes of phone conversations) are back to their impressive original levels. The battery indicator is barely a bar or two down (from 7) by evening and I only bother to charge it about 3 to 4 times a week! On those weekends when I barely use the phone it loses a bar of indicated charge if that over a day and a half.Perfectly packaged promptly shipped - well done A1 Accessories!
4	Works great nice and cheap built well.  Doesn't charge my E71 but I think thats a phone issue.
4	I was a little skeptical if this was an OEM cord as it did not come in the usual Nokia plastic box but it appears that way.  Most importantly it works just fine: connects the N8 to my PC & charges it.The clip is very handy in keeping the cord tidy.
4	I recently bought a juice pack for my iPhone 4 and it takes the micro A USB cord. They are not too common and the cord furnished with the battery pack is extremely short. The Nokia CA-101 was a better length and it was in the PRIME area.Pros:Syncs with iTunes on the iMacGreat companion in the carSolid construction; not cheaply madeCons:Cord will slip out of the juice pack battery with no-noticeNever have enoughStrong and long enough to use in case of a zombie attackhighly recommend
4	Excellent product. Works perfect and the price is one of the lowest in the market and the quality is just like the original.
4	I own two sets. Works for Dta Transfer PDANet an probably for whatever you need... Awesome buy. Works on mb511 too! I will buy another if the next phone I buy is compatible.
4	work as promise. on my nokia e 63 past Nokia C3-01 past and not my nokia e5. great product have being using it for more than a year
4	Not much to say other than this is a genuine Nokia cable that works with my N810 internet tablet. It's the same as what comes with the N810 and works as expected. Great price too!
4	After losing my cable I decided to order two one as a replacement and the other as a spare. The cheap price enabled me to do that. It arrived on time and if possible exceeds the performance of the original. Love it!
4	Got burned bad with a generic a while back. Make it a point to get good cables. The price on this cable is fantastic considering the fact that it is Nokia OEM. I've never had one of these to fail.  Well built and a good balance between being too thin and too thick.
4	Got it quickly. New condition. I would do business again. It does not come with thecharging cord. I had it with my original equipment.
4	Be aware this product does not include the USB or mini USB cables needed to charge the device.  However if you've already got 'em its a great buy.
4	Bought this to charge a spare battery I bought for my Blackberry 8350.  My cell phone comes with a MICRO USB plug for charging and syncing.  I wanted to eliminate a cable during travel.This unit operates off a MINI USB plug.  This means I cannot operate it from my cell phone's charger which is what I anticipated when I bought the unit.  However read on.The MINI USB input is the typical one you find on a camera card reader or older phone.  So it's easy to pick one up or find one laying around the house.The GOOD thing is there is a USB output.  Therefore I can charge both my extra battery AND my phone from one USB outlet.  I use a MINI usb cable to this unit.  Then I use the MICRO USB sync cable that came from my phone to go from the output of this charger to my phone.  I'll add a picture to show how I use it.The LED light is moderately useful.  OTHER chargers have a clear transition from charging (blinking orange color) to finished (not blinking green).  THIS CHARGER glows solid yellow while charging and SLOWLY goes to a solid green color at full charge.  I never feel you've charged the whole way and I wonder whether I'm really seeing yellow or green because the color is very similar.I almost want to discount one star because of these issues but for the price this device has excellent utility and fits my needs.Note: I tried charging both the battery and my phone at the same time off my PC USB and I got an error on my phone that there is not enough power to charge the battery.  Using an external charger worked fine there is enough juice coming from a wall unit.
4	I like this charger because is very fast and its use is easier than other that I proved ago!! Thanks
4	When the charging port for my Blackberry 8320 stopped working i decided to purchase this external charger along with another brand. This one quickly became my baby!1. It charges fairly quickly2. The indicator light is great.3. You can charge from the computer wall charger etc.It is just perfect!
4	I've only had these headphones for a few days but that has been enough time to really put them through their paces.With my cell phone (HTC/AT&T; Tilt) the experience has been flawless.  There were no issues pairing and the sound quality was really really good.  The difference between a $30 wired headphone plugged in versus the Voyager is quite minimal.I have worn the headset around the house and my office while my phone was plugged into the PC charging and syncing.  That was a very good experience.  I also tried the same while I cut the grass.  That was a great experience as I usually have wires that get trapped etc.The ear buds themselves seem to make this product for me.  If you do not like bud earphones you will hate this product.  Being a big fan of bud earphones I find that these lock out even more noise than normal.  (They passed the spouse/kids test)  This was a bonus when I cut the grass.  I didn't have to raise the volume very much to hear my music and block the sound of the mower.My experience connecting to the MSI Starkey on my PC was not even near satisfactory.  For some reason I hear the mic even when it should be muted.  This didn't happen with my Plantronics 510 headset.  That makes these virtually unusable with my PC -- or at least the experience is unpleasant enough that I would leave my headset disconnected most of the time.Overall I am really pleased with the quality of the Voyager.
4	This unit is great. Very clear. Long battery life. Be advised that it requires the source to have A2DP protocol otherwise you can't use it for stereo. I bought this for my wifes G1 turns out that the G1 does not support the A2DP protocol. It is still great a great bluetooth headset.
4	I love the new plantronics voyager 855. It pairs great with my Nokia N82. My only gripes are that the call/talk button can be difficult to press and the audio quality is good but not great. For audiophiles the 855 wont cut it. But I think I can safely say that no BT headset has great audio. If fidelity is what you want you favorite headphones are better suited for the job but if you want to walk around town make calls and listen to tunes this headset is awesome. It has great audio isolation and decent sound quality.
4	I like the stereo bluetooth from Plantronics. I would like it better if they could increase the battery life. I like the stereo cordless listening from my iPhone PC iMac or any other bluetooth. I like the small size and light weight. I get a couple hours of listening and then have to recharge. It is still worth it.
4	I've had a lot of bluetooth headsets over the years and this one currently ranks as my all time favorite. It is not perfect but it does many things well.  A summary:Pros:-paired very easily-call quality coming in and going out is excellent and works well with voice dialing (and voice commands on my iPhone).- great for listening to podcasts just using the single headset (without extra earpiece) since they are already monaural.- good for listening to music with the second earpiece attached.-controls my phone and ipod functions very well. I can pause and resume what I was listening to on my  iphone anytime.cons:-Sometimes misses a second of music (doesn't happen with calls at all).- Stereo sound quality is good but not fantastic.  Since I listen mostly to podcasts and audiobooks it doesn't make any difference and when I listen to music it is good enough for me.- the connector for charging is micro usb.  My first 855 had a problem with the connector loosening so it would reliably charge. Plantronic promptly replaced it. I hope that was a fluke or they have improved that part of the build.Overall really like this headset and its versatility.
4	The Plantronics Voyager 855 is the best gadget I own.I do not listen to music over bluetooth--bluetooth is simply too lo-fi. It is mega-compressed and distorts your music no matter what fancy headset you get.However it is absolutely wonderful for podcasts of AM talk radio. I listen to that stuff all the time--and now I can do it in any environment. Best of all in this type of application you can remove the stereo earbud and you have a single-ear bluetooth cellphone headset that can also receive A2DP signals from your phone--the only mono device I'm aware of that can do this.The only time I attach the stereo bud is when I'm mowing my lawn and want the extra sound insulation. I use the triple-flange Etymotic eargels for it. It's a fight to get them attached but the great sound insulation that results is an absolute wonder. Makes the noise of the mower nearly disappear and lets me enjoy my favorite talk show at the time of my choosing while getting actual noisy work done.If you like to listen to talk but don't want to bother those around you who may not prefer it this is an elegant solution. They just think you're a geek with a bluetooth on the side of your head and you don't have to tell them you're listening to Rush if they don't want to know.And when a call comes through I don't need to jam this thing further into my ear with the call button to answer it. I just extend the little mic boom and it connects. Others mention that this action can pull the thing out of your ear. But with the Ety eargel it has a good snug fit that stays secure.My favorite sports podcast sounds better on this headset than it does on my car even with its expensive Bose system. Same for every other radio show I download to my blackjack. How nice it is to hear a 3-hour show in just over an hour and a half with no commercials and over my bluetooth to boot.As you may expect I charge my 855 when I'm not using it. I've only had it run out of juice once and that was after a very long session of listening at relatively high volume with the stereo bud in. It charges up fast and goes for a longer time than it ought to. If you want to listen to podcasts on your mobile this is the best piece of hardware out there to do just that.I couldn't get any of the included eargels to fit with this device but with my weird-shaped head that's no surprise. the Ety plugs are a lifesaver and you can buy them in bulk from Etymotic so you can have a supply of clean ones. You are after all sticking it in your ear.I love this product. It does more than I hoped it would and enhances my life far beyond its low cost (got mine for $35). If you have an mp3-enabled phone with lots of memory (like a Q or Blackjack with a good-capacity MicroSD card) and you like talk radio get one of these and prepare for a great experience. You'll find yourself leaving the iPod and headphones at home because they're just too much of a hassle and this stuff works great.Love the functionality this item gives to products and services I already had.
4	I've been using my headset for four months now and have loved it.  I typically use it for listening to podcasts and audio books while I'm working and for that purpose it works wonderfully.  I've heard the sound quality isn't so great for music but to be honest my hearing isn't sharp enough to tell where it's lacking.My only complaints are with actual phone calls.  I've heard from people I've called that it picks up a lot more wind and background noise that my old Voyager 510 did.  There also seems to be a bit of a delay (less than 1/4th of a second) between when I start speaking and when the mic starts picking me up.  It's fine if I take the time to speak clearly but tends miss short one word replies completely.
4	The 855 package contains the headset itself an earhook with secondary earbud attached a worldwide charger a neckband and a little pouch containing additional ear inserts of different sizes as well as two plain earhooks (without stereo earbud wire).Even as a standalone mobile phone headset the 855 is a spectacular value. It's small sounds great and the sliding boom mike picks up your voice very well. Sliding the boom open when a call comes in automatically picks up the call and sliding it close ends the call.The headset also features an action button mute button and a volume control. Each action is signaled by a corresponding chime.Plantronics switched from their proprietary connector to a standard micro USB (the same as on the Kindle 2). The bundled neckband cleverly features a micro USB plug so you can easily attach the headset when not in use.If you want to use your headset in stereo mode (your device must support stereo bluetooth of course like most stereo telephones iPhone 3.0 etc...) simply attach the earloop accessory and use the second earbud. Note that the stereo device does not have to be the same device as your phone: you could pair the 855 with your phone as a headset and with your iPod Touch (with 3.0 OS) as BT headphones. If you're listening to music and a call comes in you will hear the ring. Extend the boom to pick up the call the music will pause and resume when you close the boom to hang up. How awesome is that?This headset is close to perfect and I found very few flaws with it:- Second earbud is fragile and cumbersome. It would be nice to have a better way to carry it maybe something that would attach to the neckband.- Previous track/next track control is combined with volume+/volume- button and requires a long press on those keys. Skipping tracks takes 3 seconds that's way too much.These are extremely minor gripes considering the excellent performance of this great headset and its remarkably low price. Considering it comes with Plantronics's spectacular customer service there really is no reason to look anywhere else for a stereo bluetooth headset. This one is a winner.
4	This is a unique product.  It is a Bluetooth earpiece; it is a set of stereo Bluetooth earbuds.  It is one or the other depending on the ear clip being used.  The earpiece is designed to go into the right ear.  There is a standalone ear clip that allows the earpiece to function as a standalone unit.  The other ear clip is wired to an earbud that goes into the left ear and allows the unit to perform as stereo headphones.  Everything can be take apart and it will all fit into a pouch small enough to comfortably pocket.  The wire between the earpieces is sufficiently long to fit any head comfortably and is cloth covered.  There are multiple sets of earplugs so you can get a good fit to your ear.Either way you have a decent-sounding (a little thin on the low end though) headset that is suitable for most any situation.  The mic mini-boom does extend out if you need it closer to your mouth but the mic is plenty sensitive (almost TOO sensitive as it can pick up a fair bit of ambient noise at times).  All the controls are on the right earpiece.  The only drawback is that the volume rocker pulls double-duty as the track forward/backward selector (you have to hold it down to engage this function and sometimes I was unsuccessful in doing so).The fact that this is uniquely convertible is quite handy but it does have a few limitations:- It is not very loud.  It depends on the phone being used with it and with some phones you may find yourself plugging your left ear so you can hear the conversation.  Note though that using the left earpiece will help with this.- The charging port is a MicroUSB rather than the MiniUSB that is found on most headsets.  There is a charger included but if you want to use a regular home or car charger you will have to buy an adapter ($5~8).- When the battery is low it will beep at you every 10 seconds or so which gets annoying quickly.- I haven't had problems with the ear clips but they do not look terribly sturdy.If I could I'd honestly give the product a 3.5-star rating but I will round it up to 4 just because this is a handy package to have.
4	My Samsung SCH I760 easily links up with this device.  This revolutionary headset has attributed to me setting aside my mp3 player.  While the sound quality is good but not great the functionality to discreetly listen to music while on my break and being able to talk handsfree has easily made this bluetooth stereo headset a winner with me.
4	I've used the Voyager 855 for about 15 hours and I am pleased with the purchase. I use it with an Iphone 3G while working out. For me having the headphone cables out of the picture is worth the drop in music quality. I get some pauses in the music if I don't turn off the WiFi on the Iphone. I get the impression the phone gets too busy to keep the music playing. The noise cancellation is not very good on the out-bound portion of phone calls but I don't use the phone that much while working out. (No one wants to hear that much heavy breathing.) For the price it is a great buy.
4	This thing rocks and they give you a lot of accesories with it. Definitly the best recommendation ever...
4	purchased from a store through price mistakethe headset is closed type earbud almost completely blocks out outside noiseon the first initial trial found sound from both ears is strange and soon realized one side speaker is reversed and disassemble the extended earbud and re-solder after that sound is 99% perfect from both ears as other poster said the main unit should be put on right to get correct stereomicroUSB charging just adds ease of operation I even don't need included AC adapter because I have several microUSB cable can charge right from computera2dp operation is OK but prev/next operation is kinda hassleand I see another problem there's no small silicone flan fortunately you can buy Sony and it fits (I use med size though)it comes with 2 extra earhook to let it stay over the ear without falling off and a lanyardpro:complete sound isolationmicroUSB chargingexcellent sound for both voice and musiccon:AVRCP is kinda hasslelacking small size silicone earflansconclusion the current price is a good deal if you need wireless headphones to use under noisy environment (like in the train) this is a good choice due to sound isolation
4	You can really stream music to just the main ear piece. The other earphone is optional if you want total immersion in what you are listening to. If you are at work and don't want anyone to know you are listening to music then don't use the extra earphone. Awesome product!!
4	This headset gives me exactly what I was looking for. I listen to a ton of podcasts and now I don't have to have wires running all over my body any longer. I don't need stereo - but I've got it if I want it. This product gives me what I need and the power consumption is reasonable too -both on my iPhone and the device itself. The audio does cut in and out once in a while but I think it's because of interference from other wireless devices.
4	I can't say enough nice things about this device. My only desire is for a standardized user-changeable battery so that I won't have to buy another headset when this battery gives out. And come to think of it a bigger and more robust storage-bag would've been nice too. Stereo function works well for all but serious audiophiles.
4	You can't really compare this headset with any other headset because as far as I know there isn't another headset like it. With this headset you can use it as stereo or unplug the wire and hang it on one ear like a standard headset. It is A2DP or whatever those letters are that mean it controls your phone from the headset if your phone has those features.
4	This came with four different size ear buds none of which fit my ear canal. I had to spend a lot of extra money on custom ear molds but now I am very happy. With the custom ear molds they stay in place perfectly even while running. They are light small and deliver decent sound and it's great with the cell phone. The noise reduction wile I am talking on the cell phone works better than any other ear piece that I have ever used.
4	I liked it it was useful and good quality while listening to music just did not like much when using it to answering the phone.
4	Since I originally reviewed this product the price has actually gone... up? If you can buy this stereo BT set for $40 and under snap it up. Otherwise pass on it.I was a little skeptical about buying a stereo Bluetooth for such a bargain but this is a nice headset. Mind you it's not perfect but the sound is reasonably good. It you are expecting the sound quality of Shure headphones your expectations are not realistic. However this headphones do offer fairly accurate mid-range response fair bass and decent highs. I use them with my iPhone 3G S and have found that the jazz setting for the EQ produces the best results. The attachment for the 2nd ear' works great and is very unobtrusive. I think it would be hard to beat this product for any stereo Bluetooth under $75.
4	When I decided to buy a headset my number one concern was that it worked with the Iphone 3GS.  The Voyager fits the bill and has great features. The best feature of the Voyager 855 is the wrap around earbud feature which gives you true stereo sound.  Th wrap around cord and earbud are detachable from the headset by pulling out the adapter and over the ear clip.  There are four sizes of earbuds included which is a plus.  Once you get used to pushing the earbud in - the ambient noise just disappears.  Pairing is easy and I have paired with both Iphone and MacBook Pro with no difficulty.  There is a slide-out feature to the headset which is really beneficial when there is any wind. My friends say they my voice is much clearer when using the slide out feature.Overall this is a great product.  I do find I have to push the bud in the ear at times but I think that is more due to me trying to determine what is the best size earbud.  The only downfall is the distant between iphone and headset is WAY less than advertised.  When I get around 10 feet from my iphone I start dropping signal if I turn my head wrong or go around a corner.  I usually keep my iphone in my pocket or on the counter or desk where I am working so it isn't much of a problem for me.  I bought this as a goldbox value and I have not been disappointed.  Great product!
4	Installation was pretty easy.  Has simple to connect power and ground connections.  RCA's plugged right into my stereo.  Couldn't use phone control lead as my head unit only has a TEL MUTE function;  it needed to use the signal to switch to AUX.  No problem I do 99% of my listening from media from my phone.A bigger problem was the velcro fastening.  The car side velcro's glue was of such poor quality that it wouldn't stick well enough to stay on when separating the two velcro strips.  The unit side wasn't any better.  The fastening between the two strips was stronger than the strip itself on the unit side!  I pulled on the car side velcro and the unit side came apart.  Absolute rubbish.  Use a razor to remove the remains and used contact cement to glue the unit to dash.  Contact cement is applied to both sides allowed to cure for 10-15 minutes then bonds instantly when the two touch.  Bond is like glue on doublesided tape but a bit stronger.Another serious problem was a super bright LED on the unit.  It is bright enough to leave trails on your vision and endanger everybody during night driving.  Clearly nobody at clarion had a functioning brain cell when that LED was spec'd.  Maybe it can be dimmed?  I put black tape over it.Unit works well.  Took call and it muted the a2dp and switched over.  For some reason the call was entirely on the right channel.  Person I talked to said I sounded like I was in a tunnel but conversion was completely intelligible.Unit gets attention of my phone every time I enter car and connects without hassle.  I have a dash mount for the phone so I don't need any kind of display other than the phone's.Would have given 5 stars but took off a point for the  superbright LED.
4	Works well with droid X.  I use it mainly for streaming music and not for talking via bluetooth.  I have a clarion dxz785usb headunit.  This little device works fine for what it does.  It seems to make the low end too loud but that may be a setting on my phone I have to look.  As far as sound quality I haven't gotten to try any 320 kbs songs to play on the phone yet over bluetooth seeing as I just got it and hooked it up a few hours ago.Overall:It only took about 20-30 minutes to completely route the wire pull the radio and wire into my existing setup.It looks pretty nice.The led is pretty bright in the daytime. I plan on putting a small piece of electrical tape over 50-75% of the light portion so I can see that it is connected but not be blinded.It is nice and small maybe 1.5x1.5 inches.The next buttons do not change the song on my phone may just be my phone but either way I didn't expect them too.
4	I loved this bluetooth I still own it and would purchase it again with no problem. Made really well great job.
4	**Using this with the iPhone 3G**  This is my second Plantronics headset and I'm very impressed.  I did get a cheaper headset inbetween the two and it wouldn't even pair with my iPhone.  So I went back with what worked.  It paired easily and has been doing well.  The one thing that I have a problem with is the distance.  They say I can go up to 10 meters away and still not have a problem.  I'm sure that distance is padded a bit but I have problems if I even go upstairs.Even if I'm in the kitchen and I go into the living room (same floor) it gets very very fuzzy.  I would put the distance to where I can talk clearly at about 15 feet... which is about half of what they boast.  The volume on the side could use some work.  I can hear just fine and regular volume is just fine but if they have a way for you to adjust it then I need to hear a noticeable difference between the lowest setting and the highest setting.Other than that I'm very happy with my wireless headset and would definately get another Plantronics headset.  Oh I also like the design.  Not a big fan of the other headset that make you look like a telemarketer!
4	I'm comparing this with a Motorola H300.  Currently it is hooked to a Nokia from T-Mobile.1. It is much lighter and fits much better than the H300.  It seems more secure - the rubber earbud does not block the ear canal (on purpose for driving - you need to be able to hear around you) but it provides a stabilizing point.  The Motorola system is just to hang on the hook - one point of stability plus gravity. The Jabra has like a two point of stability deal plus gravity.2. The hook is easy to switch around so that it goes on the left side.3. It fits well even though I have glasses on.4. It supports all the basics: voice dialing (who knew this phone supported that - but it only works approximately when things are very quiet. Speaking a short sentence is amusing - it brings up a ton of things) answering hand free hanging up and switching a call to and from the earpiece.5. It practices serial monogamy. It can pair with one device at a time and the same single button that hangs up or answers the phone with a momentary press and redials with a double tap and goes into voice dial mode with a 2 second press when you start by being on hook and switches the call to the handset with a 2 second press when you are off hook and switches the call from the handset back to the headset with a three second press and turns the earpiece off with a 4 second press with an even longer press goes into discovery mode (for about 120 seconds).  When you read about how many things the single button can do with different length presses you might begin to wonder will I accidentally turn off the headset trying to voice dial?Yes you will - unless you carefully listen for the beep and release the button when you hear the beep. So far the disconnections have been amusing and have only happened when I was distracted.6. People have said that there are only four volume positions. What the earpiece has is a button that transmits volume up and volume down to the phone. It gets back a message that says ok or end of limit.  My phone has eight volume steps and when I adjust the volume the adjustment steps appear on a slider on the faceplate. I also suspect that on the phone is where the volume adjustment is happening.  So how many volume steps you have is based on what your phone can do not on what the headset can do. (I'm a little hard of hearing in a quiet room I find that six of eight is about right in a more noisy area seven of eight).7. Voice dialing is a joke. It brings up almost random numbers that only rarely even sound like what I said. I think that the failure is in the phone and that this is something that they added to make regulators happy and that it is tested with five radically different sounding names. But that is not the headsets fault.
4	Plantronics makes the best bluetooth headsets you can get for the cost. No contest. I have made the mistake of purchasing Jawbone Sennheiser BlueParrot Motorolla Blue Trek and god only knows which others. Plantronics is the only brand I've purchased more than 1 of. While many of these brands cost well over 4 to 5 times what this one does none of them can compare on battery life consistency of connection or all around value. This headset does take some getting used to as the rubber boot on it slightly penetrates your ear but after a few days you will forget you are wearing it. The only headset I've found that was easier to hear was the sennheiser but it likes to stop communicating with your phone til you re-pair it and costs about 6 times what this does.Background noise suppression is stereotypical if there's noise the person on the other end will most likely hear some translation of it. The mic is not as sensitive as those found in the Jawbone so doing something productive like washing dishes won't blow out the eardrum of whoever you are speaking with but they will hear some level of noise(the Jawbone is brutally painful for that!). I think this is the 5th or maybe 6th plantronics I've bought and I'm sure it won't be the last.On a side note the battery under constant daily use should last you approximately 500 charges or 1.5 years avg.  This is typical for any and all bluetooth headsets. At a cost of less than $20 that means this unit will cost you barely $1 per month as opposed to $10-15 per month for some of the designer headsets!
4	These are not high quality but for the price you can't beat them.  I've bought many of these and they last quite a bit.
4	I have been using this charger for over one year.  I use it to charge a bluetooth earpiece and an external battery for the iPhone.  I has worked well for me.
4	4 stars because the quality is fairly cheesy... but hey at a buck who can agrue?  I got a few of them since they were a dollar and they still work well.  2 months in.
4	this product works great and does what I need it to do and still to this day works just fine and I have had it a little over a year.!
4	does the job what is for no heating issues but the built is not super quality neither did i expect that. happy for the amount i paid. looks good too.
4	I like that it retracts and stays right at the length that you want it to.  I would suggest it to others.
4	My friend had purchased one for me over 2 month ago. Works great charges great looks great.I'm really thankful...
4	I needed one of these to connect one new camera to the computer.On this specific cable everything is done right including the price. It is USB 2.0 certified meaning that it supports data transfer rates of up to 480Mbps and if your device accepts a Micro-B plug this is the cable to get. Maybe the 2-meter length (6+ ft.) is a little bit too much but it does not bother me a lot and there may come a time when a cable this long may come in handy.I am awarding this item 5 stars for price quality and especially for the very good presentation on Amazon's page.______________________________________________Notes:Anyone in the market for a USB cable should be very careful because there are at least 6 kinds of USB connectors. If you are buying a cable that connects 'something' to your computer or laptop the computer end of the cable will always be a USB-A or 'Type A' connector. At the other end you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.If your device (phone PDA camera) is a 'new' one and it's using USB chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.My advice: before ordering any cable make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need. This Amazon listing and most Cables Unlimited listings are most helpful because the Amazon page gives you a visual of what the connectors look like. Whenever in doubt do some more research.
4	#1 SellerRAPID SERVICE!!I had a problem with this produce but dealer was more then a champion to have customer satisfaction.I Strongly recommend this Dealer!!WAY TO GO Thank You!!
4	I bought this for usage with my Palm Pre.  It is a perfect fit for the Palm Pre and let's me charge the phone from my computer.
4	I wanted to connect my Palm Pre to our PC but didn't want to use the charger cable that it came with. This cable works perfectly with the Palm Pre not only for exchanging data with applications like iTunes but also with our car charger. If you need a charger or data USB cable for a Palm Pre this will do the job.
4	I have had two cell phones but was not happy with either of them. So for weeks I researched cell phones. I read reviews and even downloaded manuals to see what the various phones would do and not do. I finally decided to try the ATT Tilt.Battery life: Several reviewers complained about short battery life. So this was my first test. On day one I turned up the brightness and set the backlight to stay on longer. Then I played with it by going to every program and application. I also went to all the settings and played around getting them how I wanted. I also placed a few brief calls. Then I spent a while online using WiFi. I even took a few pictures. I put this phone through its paces for 6 hours and had 17 percent battery life left. The next day I completely drained the battery and recharged it to condition the new battery. Then I put it to work again for another 3 hours or more. I had 40 percent battery life on the second day after a full charge. Of course if I had been on phone calls most of the time I am sure that the battery would have only lasted 3 or 4 hours. Therefore because of my experiences thus far I would rate the battery life as fair when compared to some other smart phones. For power users they do make an extended life battery available online.Camera: Many reviewers also said the 3mg camera does not take very good pictures. This is true. Even though there are some settings to help improve the picture quality I found that it really did not help much. So I rate the camera as average to poor.Performance: Again some reviews I read complained about screen refresh rate or lag. I found this does happen sometimes. The lag time can be from 1 to 4 seconds. However there are ways you can minimize this. As with any computer the more programs you have running the more memory they use and the slower the response time. Try launching a few programs then tap on the memory icon. There you will see how much storage you have on the main unit and SDcard. You will also see how much memory the programs are using. To help with response time touch the Quick Menu at the top right of the screen and close all open programs that you are not using. Plus wait a couple of seconds for a program to fully load before you try to navigate within the program. Also files such as MP3s photos and documents should be moved to the SDcard to free up space on the device itself.Keyboard: I love the slide out QWERTY keyboard. It is much easier and faster to use than the tiny keys on most other smart phones. Of course having a large keyboard means you have to use both hands which most users do anyway. I give this feature a very high mark for convenience and usability.Microsoft Mobile: Personally I love this system because it is like my home computer complete with a Start Menu. I find it familiar and easy to use.Sound quality: Addressing some reviewers concerns about low sound when playing MP3s this is what I found. There are 2 sound settings. One is for the ring tones and the other for the device itself. Tap the Speaker Icon on the top right and you will see these settings. I turned both of them up all the way and launched the music player. The sound was loud and clear. I set a Blackjack II next to it and found that the Tilt was actually slightly louder.Size: I almost did not get the Tilt because of the weight. Plus it is a little thicker that most other phones. While in the ATT store I picked up a Blackjack II then a Blackberry then held the Tilt in the other had. The weight of the Tilt was a little more that either of the other two but not enough to matter to me. Although this might be an issue for some that want a smaller or lighter cell phone.Voice quality: While on a call I found the sound quality clear and loud. There is a scroll wheel on the upper left side that will adjust volume while on a call which comes in handy. I also handed the Tilt to someone and called it to see how it was from both ends of receiving and placing a call. The quality was better than my cordless landline phone. I rate the call quality as excellent.Helpful hint: When on a call the screen turns off in about 10 seconds. However you can still use the Talk key to mute the call or End key to disconnect the call. If you want the screen back on simply press the Power button on the upper right side of the phone. Or you can use the Scroll wheel but this will also adjust the volume at the same time. Also when the screen is off in idle mode none of the keys will turn the screen back on except one. To turn the screen back on from idle either press the Power button or slide out the keyboard.Word and Excel: You can create and edit in these programs without Documents To Go. Then you can either import or export them to your computer or email them. This is a great feature.WiFi: I do not text or get online that much with a cell phone. But when I do get online then this is the only way to go. Plus I can save twenty or thirty dollars a month by not getting the data plan. I simply get online at home or in hotspots. I also disabled the Media Net so that I do not accidentally get on line and get charged a fortune for it.Today Screen: The home screen desktop is called the Today Screen on the Tilt. I did not like the looks of this desktop at all. For one thing there is a lot of wasted real estate that could be used. The European version of the Tilt is different. I found a free plug-in that is the same as the other version and installed it. There was no editing the register you just click on the file then reset and that is it. Now the Today Screen is fully occupied with great looking icons and shortcuts that you can customize.Navigation: There are a few choices when it comes to navigating. You can use the scroll wheel the touch screen or the navigation buttons on the front bottom of the phone. I also found that I can use my finger on the touch screen 90 percent of the time and with very good accuracy. I seldom use the stylus.There are a few other features you can discover for yourself. I just strongly suggest that you read the manual and experiment with the different setting to see what all it will do. I have not seen a cell phone yet that was perfect and the Tilt is no exception. However if you are aware of the quarks from the start then you simply learn how to work around them. Therefore if you want a cell phone that does it all then this is a device to consider.UPDATE: I only had my Tilt for a few days and it kept locking up when in standby. It would not turn back on by pushing reset or the power button. I could only get it working again by taking out the battery then replacing it. The phone would lock up about every 2 or 3 days. So I took it back and got a brand new one and it did the same thing. I returned it for a refund because I have no use for a cell phone I can not depend on. Therefore I can only say that my 5 star rating was for everything I listed above and I stand by it. However I have to give it 1 star for reliability.
