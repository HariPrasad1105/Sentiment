Only works one side at a time. When you connect two cables one side stop working and also overheated burning the fuses. I purchased two of them and it's the same problem. Cheap and bad quality.
2	I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months it subsequently died on me.Pros:-Has 2 USB ports for charging one (the top) is 2.1 amps.  The bottom slot is lower presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course after this charger died I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring bad design I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.
4	This charger works great and is short unlike most chargers. It does a great job with charging both my phone and my GPS when I am in the car.  Great value and easy on the wallet.
0	I bought 2 of this and tried to test first ... after few minutes of charging it felt hot. Pulled it out and the product smelled burnt. Tried the other one too and same thing. Be careful... this one could be fire hazard or could potentially destroy the electrical system
2	It looked like it was used! It was broken when it got to be the paint job was horrible.I would never get it again
0	This case for some reason is peeling there isn't much left of the orginal skin i  loved the case with pink being my favorite color but i wouldn't recommend this specific one for anyone.
0	JUNK!!!......This product must be miss labeled.  I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger.  The lights are on the phone says its charging but nothing happens.  I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is very upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge.  If you need a reliable charger DO NOT purchase this product.If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2 I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter.  It charges fast and is dependable.
4	A very good car charger for your phones charged my phone pretty quickly and quite affordable I recommend it to anyone to have as a back up to your charger.
2	The Samsung car charger has stopped working within a 6 month period.  I thought a fuse was blown inside the unit but when I attempted to change it I've noticed that it doesn't come apart like most vehicle chargers.
2	WHAT A GREAT PRICE!RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX PLUG N UPLOAD SUM JUICE ...DON'T KNOW IF DROPPING IT REPEATEDLY ON THE FLOORBOARDOR OCCASIONALLY STUFFING IT IN CONSOLE TO HIDE CAUSED FAILURE ...BUT SOON THE GREEN LIGHT FAILED TO LIGHT AND PHONES DISPLAY SHOWEDIT WASN'T CHARGING. SO EITHER SPEND SEVERAL MORE DOLLARS FOR ONE WITHA HEAVIER CORD/STRONGER SHELL OR TREAT IT AS A DELICATE FLOWER.
0	Plugged into the car and worked the first couple of days. Hasn't worked since. My phone does not even recognize it's plugged in.
2	You have to hold it in a certain place in other for it to charge. I'll just buy the Verizon  charger instead
0	This thing worked well when it actually functioned but today it stopped working and I am past the 30 day return window by 10 days give or take.I'm guessing the quality might not be great as that is why it stopped working who knows.. What a waste of money.
0	First this is kind of cheap-looking but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone so that's forgiveable.  The springs on the side don't have much force though so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port.  The cable is sturdy but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle.  It's held up well since I purchased it though.UPDATE:  Stopped charging after a month.
2	I have had 3 phone chargers go bad in two weeks. I can not say where I purchased them. Most chargers for cell phones are cheaply made. This one is OK I guess.
2	Got this to replace a frayed OEM cord. The cord itself is ok ;however the plug that looks like OEM and is stamped as such is crap! Took 8 times longer to charge with this unit! When the cord was paired with the actual OEM plug in it worked fine. So if you need a cord its ok; however it is definitely not OEM and the plug is worthless. For the price and really just needing a cord it is a good value but I am very disappointed with the false markings as OEM when it is certainly not.
0	I received this product in a very timely manner which was delightful however I gave it as a gift and was embarrassed to find out it was a defective item. I was reimbursed for the product but would have much rather had a product that worked the first time.
2	It worked fine for a few days then I had to change to cord........The charger itself working fine up to this point..........Rather than send it back I bought another cord from sprint for $19.00
2	I thought this would be a Samsung product but look like a cheap counterfiet. It came crushed and is slow to charge my phone.
4	This detachable sansung galaxy s2 travel charger is simply good. It works perfectly.  The cherry on the cake is because it is longer than the factory original l received with the phone.
2	i had heard so many good things about this headset and even tried on my co-workers before i bought it but what i didn't test out was the reception/range. i have been using a logitech mobile freedom headset for almost a year now and love it EXCEPT for the fit. it fits horribly.this is where the BT205 shines. it fits great. it doesn't hurt. i can wear it for hours. it seems to have a ton of talk time (at least 6 hours i would say)...but the reception just plain sucks. i don't know if it's all the electrical devices running in my apartment but damn i can't get more than about 5 feet away from my phone before this unit starts to get all crackly on me. you almost have to have the phone 1) within about 6 feet of you and 2) have it on the same side of your body as the jabra. basically count on walking around with your phone in your pocket.do heed jabra's warnings about the wireless home network interfering with this device! and your microwave. and your electric fans...and running water...they all make reception horrible. i think my problem might have been the wireless home network. but c'mon people us geeks who use bluetooth headsets are the same geeks who have wireless home networks. duh.summary:pros:*lightweight*comfortable*got a good price on ebay ($42 shipped for new)*easy to usecons:*range range range! this is a huge one for me. if i have to keep my phone within 6 feet of me all the time what's the point?*too costly at $80 for what you get*everything interferes with this unit. you might as well go sit in a room with nothing in it for good reception.needless to say it's for sale on ebay!
0	I tried this out because my old Bluetrek that I loved died.  Actually I killed it when I forgot where it was and sat on it.  I was impressed with the advertised battery life and took the plunge.  Shouldn't have.  While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body the connection gets fickle.  You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight.  Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology doesn't it?  And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it.  So if yo get this be prepared to anger your party on the other line.  On the plus side the sound is nice and loud in th speaker.  That's about it.  Try something else like a bluetrek or motorola or something.  I am trying the Motorola next.  This thing is trash.
0	Amazon continues to ship this antenna with the Wilson Electronics Sleek Booster and it is not the right antenna. Wilson has told them many times they are shipping the wrong antenna but they continue to do it. This was very frustrating and caused me a lot of grief as I was not able to get on the Internet for a week due to Amazon's problem. I am returning the whole package to Amazon even though Wilson Electronics was able to send me an adapter in the next week or so but the primary reason I purchased this product was to use over the Holidays where the place we were staying had little reception.  Not being able to use my smartphone hot spot really made me angry.  There is not excuse for this as Amazon has been told many times by Wilson Electronics that they are sending customers the wrong product.
0	They claim this works for Sprint PCS but I got one for my Virgin Mobile MC760 and it won't pick up any signal! In fact it actually makes the signal weaker!  I have to put the MC760 in a window to get a decent signal so I thought putting an antenna on the roof would be better but when I plug it into the MC760 the signal strength goes down! I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it doesn't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive. I tried emailing Wilson but they weren't any help. Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760. I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work. The first one had bad threads and wouldn't go on all the way the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it. The third one finally did fit correctly but there was still no signal. I don't see how Wilson can get away with selling worthless junk antennas like this they must get a lot of consumer fraud complaints. I'm sending this useless antenna back for a refund.I purchased a Wilson 301101 trucker antenna mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great. This one must have been defective.
2	This didn't do much for me. Unfortunately it may not be the blame. Ironically I have a home repeater system after trying a couple of quick fixes (I thought). This was an upgrade to a combination home and mobile solution I tried first before realizing the specific product to get the results I needed for my whole house solution. So in the mobile world I'm sure this would be helpful. It is the system as a whole that needs to be configured to a need which includes area of coverage location type of usage cell frequency and more. So in putting a system together for a whole home solution you'd be wise to call on the manufacturer rather than putting pieces together which may not 'fit' the performance or compatibility of the other components in the system.
0	This headset was a piece of junk right out of the box. I had nothing but problems with it and threw it away after the first day.
2	I have been using the HS810 for 9 months now. I was initially very impressed because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different phones. (The early blue tooth standard isn't really as standard as one might hope!) However it has proven rather fragile. Within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on/off switch.  Did not impact usability so I didn't care.  For the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger (several of my colleagues are having similar problems).  The headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked. I keep the unit in my briefcase so I don't know why it is proving as fragile as it has.  If you can use it (or the similar HS850) with some assurance that it will not be crushed it is a good choice.  Otherwise I suggest looking at other designs.
2	On the positive side the battery life is good.The negatives I'll split into ergonomics sound and RF performance.Ergonomics: It's secure on my big ears but as others have mentioned that seal is nothing more than marketing and window dressing. There aren't many ear mounted devices that I can get on with at all so if you have big ears this may be for you.Sound: Received sound is weak at best if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you. Transmitted sound is also weak apparently I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.RF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can't answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing by the time it's connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.All in all I'd keep looking which is why I'm browsing headsets now.In ten years I really haven't yet found a good headset nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I'd pay a couple of hundred bucks. A decent noise cancelling headset will let you talk in a normal voice while standing between the exhausts of a 1500hp tank engine.
2	This might be the most comfortable BlueTooth headset out thereHowever I've been very upset with connection speeds and call volumeMost people say that they can hear me very well ----- however the connection speeds take forever to establish ---- in addition the call volume is simply too low to even use it regularlyI use a Treo 650 --- I've heard that this headset works excellently with Moto products - your mileage may vary.....UPDATE: I have also tried the Moto 850 ---- sadly it is really no better than the 810 --- there are some volume improvements but the volume is simply too low on my Treo 650 ---- I recommend the Scala 500
2	I have had this headset for several months now and not liking much about this headset other than its long battery life. This headset works OK but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect ie. no background or wind noise and very close to handset. I do like the feature of the headset turning off when boom mike closed because thats where the battery savings comes from. Other than that I find nothing redeeming about this headset I believe Motorola will discontinue this model because of its severe flaws.
4	This headset was purchased to replace TWO crappy jabra freespeaks.  This is very small but unlike the goldlatern bluetreks or the Jabra does not hide its mass well; it all sits right outside your ear and in completely inconspicuous.  With my old bluetrek and even the jabra my hair hid most of it which for me is a plus as I do not use Bluetooth headsets to impress people or get atttention; I don't want peoples attention and questions.Which is this headsets only drawback - it has this HUGE BLUE ORB-LIKE LIGHT on it that takes up the whole front of the piece.  YOU WILL ATTRACT ATTENTION with this headset on.  It blinks in standby it blinks when in operation it blinks all the dang time.  But if you can get passed that it does work pretty well.  The sound is a little tinny but pretty clear.  And unlike all my other bluetooth headsets the headset volume only operates the headset and doesn't link to the phone volume - this means that you have more adjustability for volume level and loudness which is good.  The mic seems really good - no complaints from those on the other end basically.  And the battery life isn't TOO ugly at 5 hours.  And the ear anchor could be a little more rigid and smaller for smaller ears but it will do as long as you are not jogging around constantly.
4	This product appears to be a genuine original equipment Blackberry car charger.  It has the Blackberry name and logo on it.  The plate on the bottom of the cigarette lighter plug of the unit states that the electric output is 5 volts 500mA (500 milliamperes or .5 ampere).  The plate on the wall charger packaged with a new Blackberry 8800 states that the wall charger output is 5 volts .75 ampere.  Thus it appears that the car charger produces two thirds the electrical charge produced by the wall charger (.5 vs. .75 amp.)This car charger is used with a Blackberry 8800 and has performed admirably and without any problems.  It costs a fraction of the price charged by AT&T; ($29.99) apparently for the same product.
4	Since BB battery does not last too long I plug in my BB car charger into my BB every time I'm in my car. This keeps my BB charged all day long. A must for every BB owner out there.
4	Love it works great never had a issue with it at all would buy a million more ifi needed them
4	It works fine. I like it if I have any problems I will update you.
4	I have been using my Blackberry Curve for almost 2 years and only 3 times have I been able to run the battery to empty in one day. This car charger works as you would expect it to so if you're more addicted to your Blackberry then I am (and I am fairly glued to mine) this charger will keep your thumbs moving even longer then they probably should :) .
4	I bought this to fit inside a kit that creates a storage space below my car stereo.  The pad has good grip on an ipod my phone and a couple pens while sticking to the smooth plastic.
4	These things are great and work for a lot of areas not just the car.  I actually use them on my art table to keep my items from moving that I use.
4	works great
0	This pad is extremely unreliable in that it does not stick to my dash and is very poorly made. One thing I will say is my wallet and phone have not fallen from the pad. Unfortunately the pad moves all around.
4	Not only is this sticky pad great to keep things from sliding but you can trim it to fit an area or 'shelf' on the dash.
4	This pad is really good it works for the porpuse that is described obvisly of you put something really big or something too round it is going to fall with any movement of the car but for the phone glases coints some small papers etc. it works and is really easy to remove and replace in any part of the car board. Highly recomendable.Note: It also looks nice in black car boards.
4	Nice sticky pad to keep my phone and glasses from sliding across the dash when I turn. How many time have i done that when i take them off to look for a paper or phone charger when driving. Its a bad habit but so is reaching for the glasses across the car and still be driving but no more.
4	I put this sticky pad on top of a cup holder cover i have on my Honda Accord 2010. I tend to put ipods or my cellphone there and whenever the car moves it slides out and falls to the car's floor. Using this sticky pad it prevents that for me.It is easy to remove if you decide to get rid of it altogether. You don't have to stick it permanently on any part of your car.Things that don't bother me about it but should be noted.It doesn't stay on the cover that well.Its like it could fall off if there was enough dust between it and the cover.Just like any other sticky thingie this thing can easily collect dust. It looks like you can just wash it off though. I haven't tried.Update:Yep you can just pull it off wash it dry it properly (overnight) and put it back where it was.I bought a 2nd one so that I can put stuff on the dashboard now. So I can use the cupholder.
2	Item was purchased for spouse.  Was not what he really wanted but the item does work for the most part.
4	I always have triable keeping my phone from moving when in my sports car. I like to keep my phone close to my hands and this sticky pad allows me to do exactly that even when I make a sharp turn. The phone alway stays in place. If it gets a bit dusty you can wash it and is as good as new again.
4	Works as advertised.  It's a tacky pad that is non-adhesive and keeps stuff from sliding around on the dashboard.  Problem with the iPhone (4S) is that the back is a flat panel of Gorilla Glass and does not lift easily off the Sticky Pad.  Instead it tends to lift the Sticky Pad off the dashboard by sticking itself to the back of the iPhone.  I'm sure the problem would be solved by using an iPhone cover but then if I did I wouldn't need the Sticky Pad at all.
4	I did take off a star in the rating because products like these are marketed in a slightly exaggerated way.There's nothing &#34;sticky&#34; about the product.  The pad is made of a specific material that is able to hold the objects in place while you're driving.  It's not perfect but for the simple task of holding a cellphone sunglasses loose change perhaps your EZ-Pass it will do the trick.I place a camcorder there to film road trips and for the most part it stays put.  Like any other product of this type if you off-road drive over unpaved roads or you intentionally drive abnormally the contents of the pad may not stay put.Summary:  Just drive normally and you won't have a problem.
2	Everything included is what you need EXCEPT for the heat gun... they do not mention. This kit will NOT remove an important part you need removed. I had to put my old broken screen/phone back together once I realized this kit did not have everything I needed. :(
2	I was able to get an iPhone 3GS to work by replacing the broken screen with this screen after following You Tube instructions.  This is a bit tough for the novice and takes patience to get it right.  I recommend purchasing a more complete glass connectors etc.
2	This product will perform it's described function which is to protect your ipone3. Just remember that it is not for new iphone4 and is not compatible with it.
2	As a user of an InCase slim model for the past year I was in the market for a new case for my iPhone. This case seemed to have all that I was looking for. The shock resistance is a plus and the color is pretty snazzy but the main problem I have with this phone is that the ridge surrounding the main button at the bottom of the iPhone's face is extremely annoying. It makes it a pain to push the button and is something I could just not get used to. If you don't mind having a ridge surrounding the main button then go for this case. But if you can see that being potentially annoying for you find a different one.
2	while yes this little case will hold your phone nicely and does look rather slick and so on it's still lacking a major aspect that all BlackBerry cases should have.I doesn't have a magnet in it that will actually turn off the key pad of the black berry phones.So no matter what you do your phone will get buttons pushed and when you take it out to start talking you'll have a message saying would you like to assign this hot key... The only way around this it to lock your phones keypad before you put it in the holder. This kind of defeats the purpose of having the case then. There are several other just as cheap cases available that do this very thing.I don't see how Amazon could have left out such a key feature in the process of making these cases.While it does have a magnet clasp on the case to hold it closed it's not positioned right to turn off the keypad at the same time. Clearly whoever designed this case knows nothing about BlackBerry products and how they work in general.such a simple thing to implement and they didn't even do that... So very disappointing.
2	The clip itself beats some other cases sold for the BlackBerry Curve. The most important part of such a unit might be the clip.  That's the part that clips to a belt or other anchor and simultaneously attached to the case and swivels horizontal or vertical. However there is no magnet in the case to turn the Blackberry off - major problem.  A separate minor issue is that the magnate in the clasp is not as strong as what I'm used to in other cases.Pros:*Clip - the part that attaches to belt and also the case and swivels as described above.*Case itself - it's tight and secures the Curve well.*Logo - I prefer the AmazonBasics brand logo over other brand logos because Amazon is known for customer service.Cons:*No auto-shut off because no magnet in case to do that.*The magnate in the clasp is not strong.*The Blackberry Curve phone loads vertically into this holster not horizontally. That makes it just a tiny bit more effort to unholster when answering a call.
2	This is a nice quality leather case but the magnetic holder isn't strong enough and comes open at times.  The sides don't hold the phone in well either so it ends up on the floor if I lay down and play with my son for a bit.  I prefer Velcro or snap tops on the case.  The second issue is the case will rotate parallel to the ground but then I would be really worried about losing my phone.The material had no funny smells like a cheap case I bought off of an online auction site and the snap is nice and firm and doesn't rotate too easily by itself.  For material quality I would give this a 4 or 5 but for my phone it doesn't work great.  Put a stronger magnet in it and slightly taller sides so the phone doesn't fall out and it would be a winner.
2	I was initially delighted when this case arrived! The leather is of excellent quality and is butter-soft. The stitching is perfect and gives it a stylish appearance. It has a magnetic closure which works smoothly. The design is well-thought out with the side gussets low on either side to allow for easy holstering and retrieval of your phone. The interior is lined with a soft napped fabric to avoid scratches to the phone. The belt clip is sturdy neatly attached and swivels smoothly.This case would be perfect except for one key feature that was left off - a magnetic proximity sensor which automatically turns the back light off and locks the touch screen when holstering and back on when retrieving your phone! This is an extremely important feature to most Blackberry users as it conserves battery life and eliminates butt dialing. I am confused at why Amazon took the time to design such a nice case specifically cut for a Blackberry Curve and failed to add this. Would have been 5 stars had it not been for this.
2	There's nothing really wrong with these protectors. They go on in the typically difficult way these things go on and they protect about as well as the last protector I had. Their texture seems a little rubbery to me compared to other smoother covers I've had in the past but that might just be a taste thing -- it doesn't affect usability at all.All in all if you need cheap screen protection you could do worse than these.
2	I previously had a different brand of screen protector on my phone but eventually removed it.  Although it applied cleanly at first overtime I noticed it became pretty gross as it collected makeup resdue and dust around the edges of the protector (i.e. where the button is and along the perimeter of the phone).However after the screen of my phone cracked I was willing to give screen protectors another try to hopefully protect my screen and give it a smoother surface to touch.Compared to the first product I tried these were much easier to apply.  It seems like they have really designed this with the intent of making it easy so you don't get bubbles the first time.  That said when you get 5 it's more reassuring that you have more if you screw up.That said these still suffer from the same problems as screen protectors overall.  If you're using your phone a lot they can pick up particles along the edges of the sticker.  Because of that I've just come to expect I will have to change the stickers out once a month.
2	I've used several iPhone screen protectors on my iPhone 3G and my wife's iPhone 3G S and this iteration is OK not the best I've seen just OK. I look for three quality's in a screen protector: ease of installation scratch resistance and staying power. It's even somewhat contentious if the 3G S even needs a screen protector as Apple would prefer you use the oleophobic screen bare; something which I would not recommend. As an aside I am currently carrying an iPhone 4 which I will use without a screen protector and rely on the Gorilla Glass to stave off scratches.Installation was typical for this category the sheet is a bit stiffer than is typical which makes it impossible to crinkle when laying it down but the squeegy card was not stiff enough making it hard to press down enough to completely get bubbles out.As for scratch resistance I'm disappointed in this protector. It's been only a week and already I'm seeing visible scuffs in the surface. This might be bad luck but I tend to think it just isn't durable enough.As for staying power that seems to be fine. Often with these products it's too easy for an edge to come loose and accumulate an ugly layer of dust. No indication of that happening here.In summary OK but I recommend theKrypton Screen Armor 2-Pack for iPhone 3G and 3GSinstead I've had good results with it.
2	It protects the screen yes. But it seems to attract dust and dirt and must be cleaned often and the material the protector is made of gets scratched really easily. I guesss thats why it comes in packs of 5
2	I have the iphone and ordered these protector films wanting to protect the phone from the hard use I put it through.  I have to say that these do work but for a few problems.  First it is really hard to get all the air bubbles out without ruining the stick on the film.  Secondly the clarity of the film after it was on the phone made it look like I was looking through a fish tank.  Not bad but a little grainy.  Lastly once a corner gets turned up even a little it gets caught on everything and I have yet to find a way to cut the corner off without either scratching the phone or peeling the entire film off.
2	It's possible I got a bad package of these screen protectors but I went through all of them in one evening because even through I used the provided cloth and eventually another cloth meant for a camera lens there were specks of dust (not visible by two different people on the iPhone) that almost seemed to be on the film from manufacturing. Of course there was no way to fix that.bI did like that you got 5 films instead of the normal 1-3 and it came with a little hard piece of cardboard to smooth out bubbles in addition to the cleaning cloth. There just seemed to be something wrong with these that they came preloaded with tiny flaws.Assuming one got a good package they were easy to install and fit my 3GS perfectly.
2	With this product you get quantity not quality.These screen protectors are thin and prone to scratching.  Mine got scratched from just wiping it with a soft cloth after applying it.Also these have a 'rainbow' look to it when the iPhone's display is off.  When it's on you don't notice it as much.One other thing to note is that these will not work with the 'slider' type cases such as the Incase Slider as the screen protector and the edge of the case overlap causing it to bubble up.  This may be a design flaw of the slider cases but it's worth noting.
2	If you have an iphone and don't use this screen protector your crazy.  Here's the thing you MUST take your time to get these on the right way.  If you rush through the way I did you will waste at least 2 of them....hey maybe that's why they sell it in a 5 pack.  If you take your time and apply it correctly they are awesome...a must have.
2	This is a fairly decent screen protector.  Once applied it does a great job of protecting my iphone screen from scuffs and scratches.  The clarity is awesome.  I had no trouble using my iphone with the screen protector.  I rated it down a little because of the card that is included for smoothing out the bubbles.  It is cardboard and simply is not strong or rigid enough.  I didn't feel like I could put any real pressure on it which made the application a little more difficult.  Other screen protector kits I have tried included included heavier pieces that could take a lot of abuse.  The one in the Amazon kit feels like it won't last through multiple applications.
2	I understant the concept. Don't get fingerprints on the screen. But touching these things isn't better. So why bother?
2	I didn't experience any installation issues with this and in fact the stiffness of the plastic makes it easier to apply without bubbles than the softer floppy kind.  The thicker kind like this flatten down better and squeeze the air out as they are applied.  I didn't need to use the squeegee.  Note that even the tiniest spec of dust will cause irreversible bubbles no matter how careful you are so be sure to clean the display and apply the protector in a very clean and breeze-free area.On to the anti-glare function...First it does work if you really need it.  However it kind of makes the display look just a tad weird and foggy.  This is not the magical anti-glare coating which is available for optics and TV screens (which eliminate glare with virtually no loss of clarity or transparency) although I don't know if that can be applied to a flexible plastic layer so maybe that isn't a fair expectation.  But the bottom line is this is a compromise which is useful if you need it but I personally would go for a screen protector without this feature.  I would rather have to occasionally angle the phone to avoid a glare than to give up full brightness and clarity.
2	I've used several screen protectors over the last two years between all my husband & I's iPhones. I thought these came with the best instructions of them all. Very easy to use tabs and stickers directing you how to apply. I am not the greatest at doing things like this and often have to refer to my husband for help. I did apply this screen protector all by myself and for the most part absent of air bubbles. It does it's job protecting your screen from being scratched or broken. I have used it for a few weeks without any damage to my screen while often dropping and improperly handling my phone ha ha. So for inexpensive easy to use protectors these are great. The clarity is great. My only complaint is that they seem to not be as sticky as others I've used in the past. If you have a case on it probably won't matter too much but otherwise you might notice corners peeling up just a tiny bit. Although it is the summer and it's hot and again I don't use my phone very carefully. Hope that helps. I'll probably buy them again to save money you get three for a fraction of the cost of the single ones at the Apple store.
2	Screen Protectors generally fall in 2 categories: the sticky type and the static cling type. This is the sticky type.  Screen Protectors generally come in 2 finishes: shiny (glare) and reduced glare as well as smooth vs soft.  This Screen Protector is softer and has reduced glare.3 (1 to screw-up 1 for you and 1 for your Significant Other) Amazon-branded screen protectors come in an easy to open cardboard envelope along with a screen cleaning cloth and a stiff piece of plastic to squeegee the air bubbles out during application.  Instructions are simple and easy to understand.  Recommended.
2	I've tried a few different types of screen protectors on my iPhone 3G. This particular model is a hard-plastic kind that is supposed to reduce glare. I haven't really noticed any difference though -- the screen is still hard to read in direct light. This film makes it a little better I suppose but not enough to make it a significant selling point. (I should note that I haven't yet tested it in direct sunlight since I seldom use my phone under those conditions.)The film was easy enough to put on. It takes a little practice to figure out how to get any screen film onto the phone but a few tries are usually enough for you to get the hang of it. The package comes with a squeegee to smooth down the film but it was too small and flimsy. Just use a credit card instead to smooth out all the air bubbles.This film is pretty thick made of hard plastic so it offers good protection to the phone's screen but doesn't sacrifice the touch-screen capability. What it does do however if cloud the screen slightly giving it a filmy appearance. Thus the image isn't as clean or crisp as it is without the protector or with some different kinds of protectors. This isn't a huge problem -- but an ideal cover would provide no problem at all.
2	Given that my iPhone has some scratches and I have never owned a screen protector I decided to pick up this product.  I must say that the results are somewhere between usefully good and a little disappointing.GOOD1) The directions are very simple.--A) Clean screen with microfiber cloth--B) Remove Tab A bottom side of screen protector--C) Apply adhesive side down on iPhone--D) Squeegee out the bubbles--E) Remove Tab B top side of screen protector2) The feel and touch of the screen is somehow better than before.  No longer is there a moist finger on a glass screen causing slow-down.  It feels sleeker.3) There are three screens in the packaging just in case the third step is misaligned or the product is warped.4) The glare is minimized greatly.5) I'm confident it will protect against scratches.BAD1) It still doesn't get rid of the bubbles that plague so many other iPhone screens protectors.2) The squeegee device is a piece of plastic that doesn't remove the bubbles causing the screen to look like a cheap tint-job from a less than reputable auto detailer.3) The actual application of the adhesive to the screen is a one-shot effort.  Do it right you're happy.  Apply incorrectly and you'll want to tear it off and try again.  There is a reason there are three available because just like lamination the first effort is rarely perfect.UGLYThe packaging was wasteful and ineffective.  First the product is the width and length of an iPhone but approximately 1/20th the depth.  So why did it come in a box that could have held a set of encyclopedias?  Second the frustration free packaging is anything but that and the easy strip removal didn't work.  I had to open it like a sealed envelop.Overall it's the Benecio Del Toro of iPhone screen protectors: it will probably work fairly well but it won't ever excite or impress.Jason Elin
2	The AmazonBasics Anti-Glare Screen Protector Film pack for the iPhone is like most thin screen protectors for mobile electronics: The concept in good but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.The biggest issue with these screen protectors (like most screen protectors) boils down to one problem: Any contamination between the screen and the thin screen protection film causes air bubbles which interfere with the iPhone's touchscreen or simply make the screen look bad when you look at it.Yes Amazon gives you screen cleaning wipes and a microfiber cloth for cleaning the screen before you apply the protective film but unless you're working in a laboratory clean room chances are that a small bit of dust or particle of dirt will get caught between the screen and the film ... creating tiny air pockets and trapping the dirt between the screen and the film so you can't wipe it away.Also since the film is basically just a giant transparent sticker if you happen to touch the sticky side when applying the film then your skin oils (and possibly and tiny particles of dirt on your fingertips) will be stuck on the film and get trapped between the screen and the film just like I mentioned before.On the bright side Amazon is giving you a three pack here so you can try again if you get a bunch of dirt on your screen and the protector film looks horrible.The only type of screen protectors that I've used that don't have problems like this are the ones that are pretty thick (which also tend to impact the performance of the iPhone touchscreen.Bottom line these things work but you need to be aware of the real-world problems that come with using protective films like this.
2	I got a set of the anti-glare and the regular screen savers for my Iphone 3gs.  This was my first anti-glare protector and I do like the way it reduces glare however like all anti-glare it kills the brightness and crispness of the screen.  For that reason I prefer the regular protector.As far as other protectors it seems to be as good as others I've used from the AT&T; store as well as others I've bought from Amazon.  No matter how hard I try I always get bubbles in my screen after a while and these are no exception.  I'll probably stick to the amazon brand but will get the regular protectors from now on.
2	I always keep my iPhone screen protected. I am an avid user of the Zagg line of shield protectors. Zagg is probably known as one of the top screen protectors on the market. The Zagg surface is VERY RESISTANT to scratching. They demonstrate its resistance with a car key trying to scratch it. I performed my own informal key scratch test to compare the Zagg to the AmazonBasics protector. It reveals that the AmazonBasics model is not nearly as scratch resistant as the Zagg.Installation is very tricky here unlike the Zagg. This shield uses adhesive only. You must follow the instructions strictly and you must try to keep you fingers off the adhesive side to prevent permanent marks under the shield. The Zagg invisible shield concept uses a liquid spray (probably just distilled water) to apply to your fingers and to BOTH sides of the shield when installing which not only makes the installation easy because you can make minor movements to line it up it also prevents fingerprints. The AmazonBasics shield does not use liquid solution for the install.If you have tight latex gloves available this will eliminate danger of fingerprints. VERY carefully pull tab 1 to peel back the screen protector but pull only part way. Take the time to line it up perfectly before you continuing to peel it back while pushing out air bubble. It can be done nicely if you are careful.
2	Once this was put on my iPhone the iPhone display looked different.  I could sort of see small (tiny) dots throughout the cover. I'm going to presume that this is the inherent design of the cover and that the way it is supposed to reduce glare is by diffusing or re-directing incident light via these dots.  I don't care for it personally but others who have seen it don't seem to mind it a bit.I haven't noticed any change in ability to select items via the touch screen interface of the iPhone so that's good.Outdoors when glare is the worst there is still some glare coming off this cover. It's no miracle worker but it does help some.
2	This was super easy to put on and had very little trouble keeping bubbles out.  The anti-glare gives your screen a slightly grainy appearance that may or may not be distracting especially since the iPhone screens are so clear.  Don't rule it out there are lots of protectors out there and I have yet to find one that really is a star performer.
2	I'm giving this case three stars because its not actually made of leather despite the name including the word leather.  Its made of very nice fake leather aka vinyl non-animal origin.  Not being a vegan I would rather have had actual leather . . .  However the craftsmanship is excellent the price is great so I'll use the case.It fits my bare Droid snugly.  The belt clip is very sturdy (belt loops seem pretty flimsy).  The magnetic closure is quite positive.If it were actually made of leather I would have given the case five stars.
2	This skin applies like the other brands - you must have steady hands and plenty of patience.  Unfortunately mine was just a tiny bit too large for the Motorola Droid screen so it does not adhere well to one of the edges.  Its really just a cosmetic issue as it has stayed put for about three weeks now (under a Seidio Innocase).  I also understand that there can be some variation in the phone dimensions themselves - which makes me think maybe the skin should be ever so slightly smaller to allow a miniscule uncovered edge.
2	Very crystal clear screen. There is no way to install this without getting one or two spec's of dust stuck under the protector. Make sure you read everyone's review on how to install this.This screen has many micro bubbles stuck under it and is not scratch proof. Do not use the applicator card that comes with it. It will permanently scratch your skinomi as it did to mine. I have had this screen protector on for 2 weeks and all these imperfections have not disappeared like everyone else claims. All in all when I turn on my Droid you can not see these imperfections.The life time replacements are a scam you have to pay 6-7 dollars to ship one to you so you might as well buy it again and get a new spray bottle.**Edit** I wanted to comment that customer service is actually great and they take care of customers that are not completely satisfied. Skinomi responds to emails quickly and customer satisfaction is their goal.
2	Very cheaply made. The cable very brittle. The covering of the cable cracks when flexed. Eventually just didn't make connection and stopped charging devices. After the course of a week we went through 2 of the 3 chargers we ordered. Shame on me what else should be expected from $3 phone chargers.
2	Great for a backup or second charger but it doesn't charge very fast and is not as long as it looks
2	I would use this as my priamary charger since my USB cable was so short. They lasted about a year. My needs have now changed so I don't use this anymore but I would consider buying it again for my office once the one I have there dies.
2	I originally ordered 8 of these for our 3 Droid X phones.  1 of them did not work.  I contacted The OEM Shop and they said they'd send a replacement ASAP.  Got it in 5 days.  This time they sent sent two.  One of these didn't work so I left a 3 star review.They contacted me immediately asking me to remove the feedback and in return would send me a complimentary bluetooth headset.  I said sure.  Got the headset in 5 days and it didn't work!Wow!  sent 11 items and 3 were duds?  That's  a 27% product failure rate.Pros:-Longer cord than original Droid X charger from Motorola-InexpensiveCons:-NOT real Motorola chargers.  Surely these would be circuit-tested before leaving the factory if they were authentic?-Cheaply made.  Cord is very thin.-Does NOT have the USB cord.  Only for 110 AC chargingOverall if you're getting these for $3.25 including shipping you're getting a good deal.  Having to buy 25% more than you need to make up for failures is not a good business model in my opinion.
2	Works great with the iphone 5 but not compatible with the 5s. Great quality for price just the one issue with the 5s.
2	The Griffin PowerJolt SE Coiled Lightning Car Charger for iPhone 5 seems to work OK charging an iPhone 5 - but the Lightning plug end is *much* larger than on the standard Apple Lightning cable or on several Belkin Lightning cables that I bought recently.It will not fit through the port hole on either of my iPhone 5 cases (Belkin Grip Candy Sheer Case/Cover For New Apple iPhone 5andSpeck Products CandyShell Glossy Case for iPhone 5); it does work on my wife'sOtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5.Griffin Tech please go back to the drawing board and come back with a Lightning plug that fits the majority of cases out there.  This one does not.
2	I am on my third one.  One broke when being stretched to the back seat and one broke after only a few uses and being put in the upholder right next to the plug.  I got lucky that it happened within the return period.  If the third one breaks too I will search for another brand but the first one did so well for so long that I felt they deserved another chance.
2	The cord is not coming out of the lightning side. Its falling apart. Be careful with this product if you're going to be using it in a normal fashion.
2	Belt straps broke after about 2 weeks of usage. Other than that the pouch is good..it's still in good shape today...I use it occasionally..
2	I originally thought that this case was like the one I already had where the front and back snap together but it's just the back cover. After putting it on and having it for a while now I love this case. It's not rubbery so it doesn't get caught up on things it's smooth and the colors are so beautiful. I don't drop my phone often - if I did I don't think this case would provide much protection but as an accessory it's perfect.January 21 2012 - I am editing my review because for the past few weeks I've realized that my case design is peeling off! I got it around the 1st of November and been using it since then. It lasted 2 months. Chunks of the design peel off every day. I'm so sad. It was such a beautiful case. I carry my phone in my pocket or my purse and not that often because I'm a stay at home mom and I tend to leave it on the desk 5 days out of the week. It shouldn't be peeling so badly.
2	This is such a cute case and fits well to my 3G but it is not very protective.  It is only a cover for the back and it does not wrap around to the front.  Worth what I paid and will be good for a night out but not for everyday use.
2	Cute case for iphone. Nice design but the case is not as colorful as pictured and is not shiny at all. Good value for the price but it's not my favorite cover. .
2	This phone case is really pretty but it doesn't stay that way for long.. It's also very soft. But like I said it doesn't stay that way and gets dirty really quickly.
2	cracked as soon as it was put on very flimsy.
2	Cheap gray plastic. Color the picture faded do not meet the same that in the picture. It looks disgusting and primitive
2	I received the battery on time and everything. That was great! It was in new condition looked unused - that's good too. However using this just seemed like that original battery. It died just as fast. I wasn't completely happy with that. But I will keep it just as a backup; since I know this phone is pretty bad with battery use.Overall if you get this battery just use it as a backup - not the primary. It's the exact same as the original.
2	This cord doesn't charge at a fast rate and isn't durable either so pretty much I just use it for and overnight charge..
2	Never could get the product to fit just right. The tip was made a little to thin and wouldn't sit right in the charging port. Shop elsewhere.
2	I have had this phone for only two months and I am now unable to use it. I know now that I should have made myself aware of the possible problemsI could experience. The phone does not turn on any longer. In fact I cannot even get into the home page. Apparently others have experience the same problem. Only recently has this model has been sold in the USA and at such a very high price one should expect more than a two month usage period before breakdown. It is a very attractive phone. If only it worked properly. I would love to get my money back and go for something that's tried and true.
2	I have a Nokia C6-00 been using it for a year. I bought the Nokia N97 Mini to compare it to my C6-00. Dimensions (length x width) they are comparable and weight-wise comparable. The C6-00 is a newer model and has a D-pad with arrows to move around with a 4-row keyboard. The N97 mini only has three rows. The N97 mini keyboard is more generously spaced out though versus C6-00. You can't really go wrong with either as they use the same Symbian system might as well go with a newer model the C6-00. Nokia is a dying breed though Symbian is not used anymore either with their flagship product. My next phone will be Android-based or Apple OS.
2	There are two versions of this product. One has a slot to charge a spare battery the other does not. This one does not. I bought one of each. While both work well the one that charges the spare battery is most useful. Prices were similar.
2	This docking station works as advertised. My wife likes it as her phone does not have a case. However it does not accept my encased phone which is irritating. The cable detaches for use without docking so the purchase works for both of us.
2	I tend to charge my Droid every evening so this dock sitting on my night stand makes this pretty convenient. The dock works well and is attractive. In reality though all it does is provide power to the Droid along with a vertical tilt. Cool and all but the price seems a bit steep for what is really just a cool convenient charger.Overall I'm happy with the device but they really should have included a longer cord. I have a power source directly below my nightstand where the dock is located. It's just an average sized night stand yet and could not be closer to the power source. However the dock has to sit a bit sideways on my night stand because at the correct angle the cord won't reach. It's that short. Think about it... 3 feet. How high is your night stand? You can replace with just a longer usb cable and their AC to USB adapter that comes with it but for that price you really shouldn't have to. Currently I consider it to be the absolute minimum length to work in optimum conditions. I'd have to guess for most people the cord length won't work at all.
2	I bought this item because I thought it would let me hookup to tv or audio system to play movies or music.  This base is a glorified USB cable.  It does offer the feel of an alarm clock music player but you could do that by leaning it up on its side while plugged in.  I think it's way overpriced for what you get.  I paid $20 US for it and basically got another charging cord (something else to have to keep track of).  If this unit had audio/video outputs it would be worth it.  I don't recommend this item unless you can buy it for 10 or $15.
2	If you have a desire to use your Motorola Droid as a bedside alarm clock then yes this dock is definitely for you. Because that is pretty much all it does (except it also charges the onboard battery).The dock triggers the phone to enter dock mode but the dock mode can be triggered by a free program from the AppMarket called DockRunner (Droid) no dock needed.And really the dock mode as shown in the picture turns your phone into a bedside alarm clock. You can set alarm trigger night mode (softer contrast) and even get a preview of the weather among a few other minor passive functions. You *could* make it also play music in the background (yes the built-in MUSIC app has a jukebox mode) so I guess it's more of a clock-radio with alarm.If I really want a clock radio with alarm I would buy one in my local Walgreens (or whatever) for $10 not pay $20-$30 for a fancy piece of shaped plastic with a charger tip.As many others have pointed out the dock is designed for an UNPROTECTED NAKED PHONE. It is not compatible with cases. If you have a case slipped on you cannot put it in the dock.While technically if you don't want the BOTTOM half protected then you can remove *THAT* and put the phone in the dock with the keyboard exposed but that rather defeats the aesthetics of the dock. Doesn't it?There is ONE good thing about the dock though... The AC adapter you get with it can be used WITHOUT the dock. Yes you can plug that tip straight to the phone skipping the dock altogether. Since a spare AC adapter cost the same as the dock on the Verizon website you may as well get the dock.If you already have alarm clocks and such then this accessory is superfluous except it looks cool. But then looking cool is not always a good reason to spend money.
2	We bought this as an alternative to an alarm clock.  It ended up being too bright so my wife brought it to work.  She uses it to charge her phone while listening to Pandora which works great.A lot of the app options didn't work like they were suppose to.  We didn't trouble-shoot it much because the options my wife wanted work (clock weather and Pandora).  I am disappointed that the screen never turned off.  Even when the brightness level was set as low as it could go there was always a little light coming off of it.
2	When i got this docking station i was ecxited about it. So i docked my phone and it has its own screen while on the docking station. What i did not like about is that if you protect your phone with a cover this docking station is totally useless so i had to get rid of since i dont work in an office.
2	The giftee didn't tell me until recently that it didn't charge the phone. She thought it was just to set it in.. o well...Just tossed it in the trash...
2	The case is very good as it protects the whole phone but the thing you should watch for is the back part of the case that snaps to the back of the phone. Mine broke and my phone fell out on the concrete. Now my phone has a crack on the screen because the bottom part of the case broke.
2	The case works well.  The rubberized feel gives the phone some feeling of extra stability.  The removable belt clip and belt clip circular piece from the back of the case is a nice feature.  It even comes with a hole plug if you decide to take the clip off.  Phone slides very easily with case on.  The kick stand on the belt clip is a cool feature so you can have the phone standing on your desk while you charge it.  Couple this with a Skinomi screen protector to give your Droid the best protection.UPDATEAfter using for several months I no longer would recommend this product.  The piece that covers the back has become loose and it no longer holds the phone in the case appropriately.
2	I bought this Body Glove case with my droid and used it for a couple of weeks before returning it and buying the Verizon OEM case and holster.Motorola A855 Droid Verizon Original OEM Belt Clip Shell / Holster(Note there are about four different entries on Amazon for what appear to be the same item.)  The reasons I returned it are largely covered in some of the other comments here. On the belt clip the display is facing out and subject to being scraped on things. It also is held out away from my body so that it snags on things.  The display is free to slide open making it even more subject to being torn off.After about a week the display portion of the case started coming off way too easily. This is just a small strip that fits around the display and really doesn't seem to add much to the protection. Apparently the clip that holds it in place wore down and it would pop off when I opened the display to get to the keyboard.Also as mentioned elsewhere the case over the back of the phone was extremely difficult to remove and really did feel like it could pull the phone apart. I don't have a dock for the phone so this was not a big issue since all the ports and buttons are accessible.On the good side this is a nice heavy case with a bit of a tacky feel making it much easier to hold the phone. the button for the belt clip can be replaced by a plug that is flush on the back of the phone but this requires getting the case off the phone (see above complaint).Overall this is a nice case but I really can't recommend it especially after I have used the Verizon case that I have now.
2	I figured at the asking price this item would out do all the other protection screens it worked pretty good for about a week then I started to notice the screen having finger marks right there where I was pressing on it the most. I text quite a bit therefore the screen had little press marks on them (especially on the letters that I use the most). this is only after a week then I began to notice scratches on it this item is very easy to scratch. I was very happy with the way it looked at the beginning unfortunately it begins to look bad after a very short time.if this could be made of better plastic so that it would resist scratches and not show finger smudged it would be a good product
2	I didn't like this produvt.  Very hard to attach to the phone.  The air bubbles were very difficult to remove even with the plastic card to run over the screen.
2	i would never get his again this is harder then it looks.  its easier to do a 4 replacement then this 3 replacement
2	I love how it fits perfect and I have no problem what so ever I recommend this product to everyone.
2	After replacing my wife's iPhone screen a couple times I decided that it just wasn't worth the hassle of buying the glass separate from the home button and so I bought this preassembled part. It was worth the extra money to just be able to change out the LCD from the broken glass to this glass and then pop the front back in.After reassembling the phone however one of the two bottom screws would not seat into the metal brackets of this screen assembly. This must have been due to a poorly milled metal bracket that just wasn't big enough to accept the screw so I just left the one screw out. I'm giving this 3 stars in hopes that this was more of an exception than the rule and at this low of a price you are getting what you pay for. Also it seems like the quality of the ear speaker was not as nice as the original but again you aren't paying for original quality and the quality is tolerable.Overall this is a cheap fix for a broken screen. Obviously it isn't Apple quality parts but it also isn't $200. If you need an Apple quality end result this may not be for you. If you just want your phone back in working order this is your part.I hope this was helpful. Let me know if you have any questions.
2	The charger stopped charging after about 4-5 times it will not charge at all the connector is loose. I only got to use it a few times
2	Nice headphone works well blocks external noise quite well. however the product is flimsy and after around 4 months of continuos use it stopped working. the mouth piece came off.
2	Good headset. Can wear a long time. Compared the headset with some others like a wired plantronics that has a small boom mic wireless inexpensive jawbone headset and another standard headset that came with my Samsung Epic with Sprint where the mic is on the cord. This headset was pretty dull. Some people complained that it was hard to hear me no matter where I had the mic placed. My voice is a little dull anyway so that made it pretty tough to hear me. Other headsets had a louder volume to them than this one. It wasn't bad just not impressive or did it have a good response. Any input into the mic doesn't come through the speaker in the headset so you never really know what the other person is hearing from you. There is no cutting out of the voice though like with some headsets. The speaker is very clear and is easy to hear others. It doesn't cut out a lot of ambient noise in the room but it's okay. It's hard to make the speaker loud on my phone. I can make other headsets much louder. So if you're in a noisy environment this may not be the right one for you. Overall it's just an average headset. If you will be using something for a long period of time and need a inexpensive headset this is the one for you. If you have a loud voice this one will be great for you. Otherwise I suggest going with another.
2	At this price one cannot expect studio quality. This product is good for conference calls using a cell phone. I've used it for recording and the mic is decent but other more expensive headsets have better quality. The band is too small and it takes some adjusting to get into a good position on the head. A little small for a full grown man. Overall no complaints at this price.
2	The sound quality is good on one end but bad on the other. I can hear the people I'm talking to very loudly most of the time but many people have said that they can't hear me clearly. Also the sound seems to go in and out sometimes. I've been using this for about a month now and it's getting worse. At first it was great but now it seems like I'm having problems more often than not. It's still worth the price though. For $6 I can't really complain.
2	I have been using a cheap pair of rocketfish headset and I thought I'd try these since they were cheaper $6 vs $14.  Big mistake these are very uncomfortable and they feel much bigger on my head.  I use them as a spare.  There is no quick mute button or volume button on them.  They are simply just a headset.
2	For the price it worked.I needed it for a trip and it allowed me to keep both hands on the wheel.The volume was somewhat low.But it works
2	This headset is more volume power away from being a fantastic headset.  It is very comfortable the microphone picks up your voice extremely well.  With one problem...  The volume is extremely low specially if you are using it in the car you just won't hear the call volume at all.  Very sad so close...  Yet so far.
2	I go this because when I am driving (windows up) no one can hear me on the phone using my bluetooth or stock headphones that came with my note 3. I would always need to shout or speak loud. It became very annoying. I was looking for something that the micophone  can reach to the front of my mouth so people can hear me clearly. This product does well in that. People hear me nice and clear as if I was on the handset its self. The only thing I didnt like about it is that the ear piece should be a bit louder. With my volume up on high I still wish it was loud enough so I myself can hear clearly. Its still worth keeping for the price.
2	Very very uncomfortable.  Doesn't work most of the time.  Looks like a child's toy.  But I read most of the reviews before I bought it and many people who seem very knowledgeable said it was a good buy for the money.  I should have read those last 3 words more carefully.  Thankyou.
2	i like this in the car because I know people can hear me..sits a bit far from my ear though.  I took off the big foam from the mic.  I dont like blue tooth and the tiny mics I seem to have people always say I CANT HEAR YOU.  so I got this it is OK
2	I bought two of these headsets at the same time for use with my blackberry.  The first time I took this out and made a call there were several problems:- One of the headsets had static noise from lose connection at the plug.  Instantly recognizable since the noise comes only when the plug section is touched.- Both headsets were affected by the all-to-popular interference noise of the blackberry which was the primary reason for me buying the headset in the first place.  The noise does not exist with any of the other android or iphone - only on blackberry does this radio noise exist.The construction is decent and wearing it was comfortable.  However the static noise and the interference on blackberry made this useless for me.Not even worth the trouble of returning this to Amazon.  Pay a little more and get something that actually works.Not recommended.
2	This is very bulky and hard to find a place to keep it but the sound is quite good and it is very comfortable. I don't like that it doesn't have a button to receive or end calls on it; which means you have to look away from driving for a second to receive a call. If your phone has an auto answer function this would work but mine does not.
2	OK as everyone has said there is no circuit for the button I could live with that but why have the metal plate there that has had the plastic mounting points melted to hold the plate?You have to cut those off to get the plate off. If they were left un-melted with no plate you could install your original one and then melt them to hold it in place. I had to use a couple of drops of super glue.
2	Nice replacement. Easy to install and all tools included. Button stopped working soon after installing though. Had to tear back apart to replace.
2	Be very careful with this thing it is very fragile. It can break if bent the wrong way at all. The adhesive is also hard to get right. If you get it all in the waay it is supposed to it does fine.
2	When I completed the installation of the screen/digitizer my phone speaker didn't work. My phone was still usable as the speaker phone still works (as well as my headset) because they're not part of this replacement assembly. As I went to remove the screen/digitizer to reseat ribbon 3 (my first method of troubleshooting) and the suction cup pulled the screen from the digitizer. With the screen now detached from the digitizer I had to press firmly on the sides of the screen to even use the touch screen.I ordered an adhesive replacement kit ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y3L5B8 ). I've reattached the screen (like it should have been attached when I purchased the item...) and reassmebled the device yet the speaker still doesn't work. The proximity sensor works though and since this data is passed over the same ribbon as my speaker that doesn't work I believe the speaker was broken to begin with. All in all I am disappointed: the cheaper replacement proved to be cheap indeed.The screen also feels slightly different. My friend who also owns a 3GS asked if I had a screen protector on it. There's a little bit of a border around the LCD screen but that's not the deal breaker in comparison to the non-functioning speaker!
2	this is great product with tool and good price too & easy to installed but when they are send product they are missing tool ?
2	worked as advertised.  but somewhat more fragile.it has been a while since I purchased this but I think a piece of hardware was missing as some of the other reviews said.read them.
2	I think it's important to know who I ordered this item from since there are multiple sellers and quality is most definitely not the same for all: ZHDU1120.I replaced the screen assembly and it went okay I had to jiggle it a little to make it fit. All good until I started the phone up - ear speaker is not working so I'm forced to use speakerphone mode.Ordering from ZHDU1120 (after reading a recommendation from another user) was a huge mistake. Seller sent 1 of the 2 I ordered then sent me extra tools as the second item. Awfully slow shipping too coupled with incorrect shipping of ordered items and a broken item = big waste of time. Overall worst experience with an Amazon seller to date.
2	Replaced glass and found out the LCD panel also needed replacement.  Found a great shop at Sugarloaf Mills in Duluth GA.  They added the LCD panel for $40 and $20 labor and used this glass.
2	I was able to get this repair to work one time but then switched to the more complete unit.  Even with You Tube instruction videos this was a bit advanced for me.  It did work though.
2	Although the item seems like a good idea using this for an extended battery just doesn't work as it can't hold the girth of the battery.  I tried using it also on the normal size S3 battery. For that it worked.
2	it ok my big brother said t works but it charge slow he ould have to put it on the charger
2	The charger works but it looks cheaply made.  Has a VERY strong spring to hold the battery in place but that also makes it difficult to get the battery in the charger.  This does work and if you are looking for an inexpensive charger this is it.
2	This is a little complicated to work but IT ACTUALLY CHARGES batteries I would buy more if necessary not expensive
2	I've tried this device twice carefully following the instructions and waiting a long long time. Even after 24 hours despite the red light and the other blinking red light I don't think it really charged the battery. Each time I put the battery in another charger and it showed low charge and took a long long time to get back to full charge. I guess if you had absolutely no other way in a pinch this might be useful as a last resort. It looks cheap and the design is weird. Would not recommend it.
2	I only rated this charger two stars because it takes so long for this second battery to charge. I have two external chargers that I plugged my spare batteries into and my captivate battery charged much faster then my infuse battery (they both were completely new & needing a full charge). So it works however its taking 7hrs or more to fully charge my spare batteries.
2	The black color of this skin doesn't cover all of it. There is a bright white pronounced border of plastic that was not color coated black. This sticks out noticeably and looks bad. Seller said all of them are like that. Just a lazy manufacturer not finishing the painting job. Adds a considerable amount of bulk to the phone but it doesn't make the phone less slippery to hold. I agree on the lint-collecting complaint. Constant lint build up in areas very difficult to clean.
2	didn't fit the phone as advertised so I took a match to it and burnt the s*** out of it and threw it away
2	POOR QUILATY MADE WITH I DONT KNOW WHAT BUT BROKE IN 2 SECONDS MAYBE I HANDLED IT WRONG HOWEVER I DONT THINK SO IT FEEL APART BUT I WAS NOT ABOUT TO PAY TO RETURN IT COST WOULD NOT BE WORTH IT.
2	I bought this on Amazon for my Droid 1 and used it about few months. The back cover is solid but the front cover is the one always breaks because the clipping parts fall off. I have used two of these and I think I need to get the higher quality ones.
2	The Motorola Droid (A855) window mount is fairly basic -- it's well made but not as well made as some of Motorola's older window mounts.A Droid will automatically go into automobile mode when inserted into the holder and the horizontal (landscape) orientation is perfect for GPS (a little clunky for phone -- but you shouldn't be trying to use the keypad while driving anyway).The keyboard won't open when in the mount -- again you shouldn't be using the keyboard when driving... but it'd actually be nice not to have to take the phone entirely out of it to enter an address when you're parked.If you have a Droid 2 the Motorola window mount for that is so much better designed... and there's no reason why this one didn't mate power rather than forcing your to insert the power cord separately.The price isn't bad; but you might not actually get that much more bang for the buck buying Motorola over one of the generic ones... though most of those hold the phone vertically (so weigh how much you will use GPS vs phone).You won't go wrong buying this product -- but it just isn't what it should be.
2	I sent this charger back once I learned it would not accept the droid if it had ANY case.  I want a case for protection of my Droid so this is unacceptable.Since I ordered a Seidio case I plan on ordering a Seidio car mount/charger as it will accept the Droid with or without the case.  It does cost $10 to $15 more than the Motorolla car mount however.Motorola should realize most owners of their cell phones (especially high end phones) will insist on a case for protecting their investment and offer accessories that accomodate a protective case.
4	I keep one of these at my office desk and one at home. It provides a great place to locate my cell phone or bluetooth stereo speaker. No clanging when I lay the items down. No strange echo vibrations from hard surfaces. AND no vibrating off the counter - which had happened before without the pad.
0	Even though the package and description stated there was no adhesive there certainly was a white backing too remove and place on dash . I felt the item was very thin and to the touch not sticky at all. There were no groves as competing products and the part that faced up that was supposed to attract and stick was smooth. Overall I was not impressed.
0	I bought 10 of these.  They are the worst product I have ever used.  They DO NOT work as advertised.  Nothing sticks to them
4	She used to keep her cell in the side door pocket and was always missing calls & messages but problem solved.Has never fallen off.
4	I bought a similar one @ a local store & was surprised how well it held my phone my sons phone & iPod.  I pd almost $6 & it is 1/2 the size of this one.  I needed another one & it looked bigger. Wow!! It's bigger I have a. Portable fan even on one of these!!  I loved it so much I bought another one. WARNING.... This has NOTHING to do w/ the product itself BUT if u use this for your phone iPod & it's HOT outside & u have this on ur dashboard... DO NOT put your phone or iPod on it!! My phone over heated!!!! Thank goodness it ok my phone.... But u live & learn. I also keep loose change on it... Glasses... Small toys stay too!!!!  Enjoy !!
4	Like so many other reviewers I had this Think Outside Stowaway collecting dust as I had bought it for an older phone.  I was actually looking on Amazon for a foldable keyboard and came across this and these reviews.  So I found my Stowaway (quicker than I thought I might!) did not load the software that came with it (as the instructions tell you to do) but just decided to see if it would sync with my Playbook.  First of course I had to put 2 AAA batteries in it and VOILA it worked!!!  I am a happy camper!!!  As another reviewer said it is surprising that some other manufacturer hasn't continued this concept in folding keyboards.
4	I just paired this with my Hisense Sero Pro and it works great. I've tried many portable keyboards but none with this build quality and keyboard comfort. Truly feels like a real keyboard that folds up small. The stand holds my 7 inch tablet well. No more lugging around my laptop. This is all I need.
4	I bought this keyboard when it was first released back in 2005 took it out today to test it with the idea of selling it. But after installing it on my current device (Verizon XV6800 running Windows Mobile 6.1) I decided I liked it too much to sell. I forgot how much I liked this keyboard. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of two annoyances:1. The numbers are accessible only through function keys - a bit of a pain. I would have preferred another row of keys. It wouldn't have added that much size or weight.2. When the keyboard is open it's supported in the middle by what becomes the case and the ends extend on either side like wings. If you are a slow typist this is fine. But I'm a fast typist and I tend to hit the the keys pretty hard so the keyboard tips from side to side when I type. Really irritating. I fixed this by making two little supports from stacked cardboard glued together. I stick these under the wings and that solves the problem.Here's where I got the latest driver released for the device (it's no longer supported by iGO):[...]This driver is for Windows Mobile 5 but it works on my Mobile 6.1 device. :)You MUST install the driver in MAIN MEMORY - not a storage card. If you install it on a storage card it won't work.After I installed the driver the configuration utility suggested that I upgrade the keyboard's firmware. I thought this wouldn't work since the keyboard is no longer supported by iGO but to my surprise it did - my firmware was updated from 1.1 to 1.2.The previous reviewer said he had to use the pointing stick to send email. That's because he didn't know the keyboard shortcut for Send: Alt-S.The keyboard folds up very small and compact and it's very light-weight - not a big deal to carry it around along with my SmartPhone. No more picking at the tiny on-screen keyboard when I want to send email from my phone!
0	The keyboard will connect to an iphone 3GS with iOS 4 but will not reconnect automatically.I did the CTRL + LFT FN + RT FN keys and the light on the keyboard starts flashing.  Then check the bluetooth on the iphone and it discovers the keyboard.  Then when you pair it the iphone will ask you to enter a 4 digit code and press enter on the keyboard.  That part works perfectly.Then you can use the keyboard on the iPhone 3GS.  But when you close the keyboard and the bluetooth connection is broken it will not reconnect when you open the keyboard back up.  I tried pressing keys and waiting.  I checked the bluetooth status on the iphone and it shows not connected.  No matter what I do it will not reconnect.  I have to manually re-pair the keyboard and phone to get it to work.  That makes the keyboard completely useless on the iPhone 3GS with iOS4.  There is a video posted on youtube where another person had the same problem.If anyone was able to get it to work properly with an iPhone 3GS with iOS4 please let me know how you were able to do it.
0	The driver for this device completely broke my Treo 650 fortunately I have Sprint's insurance plan so I was able to get a replacement Treo. I used the latest driver from the Thinkoutside website. If you have a Treo do not get this device.
4	This is a great Bluetooth keyboard that is very compact and easy to use. It does work for Android and iDevices and has a shelf for you device to rest on so you can see the screen while you type.
4	The iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard is truly portable.  Running on two AA batteries you can easily carry spares around.  Only gripe about this product is that it lacks a dedicated number row (for 1 to 0).  Else it would be perfect.
4	I just love this keyboard. I've used it with my HTC and now with my unlocked iphone using BTstack Keyboard from Cydia. The only issue is that it really needs an extra row of keys. The numbers and symbols are placed on the top row of letters (where the letters QWERTYUIOP are in the keyboard). To access a number you need to press the left function key and the corresponding letter. To type a symbol you need to press the right function key and the corresponding letter. I work in finance and many of my annotations need numbers and symbols like 10% for example. For that it takes a long time. I find it easier to type ten pc instead of 10%.I'll buy a new keyboard just for that. But besides this the keyboard is just amazing. So if you don't need your numbers and symbols too often I really recommend it.
4	First off I have had this product since 2007 and was fortunate to catch it at a great bargain!!  Since then I have not had one problem with it except when I forget to change the batteries!I have been able to successfully pair and use this keyboard with originally a Samsung I760 then a HTC Touch Pro 2 and now my Motorola Xoom tablet.  I was surprised that I didn't even have to download drivers it worked once I simply paired it.Not having number dedicated keys was a sacrifice but I can type memos emails or simply work on a novel at anytime conveniently by having this portable keyboard.  The keyboard itself is very durable and has a sturdy feel when you are typing.
0	I purchased this product to send over to my wife who is on a trip and complained about typing on a Blackberry. I thought I better install it before sending it after her so I could guide her along. No PC where she is so I tried to download as advertised. Result: Page Not Found.Company advised that since this is a discontinued item (?) they took down the support pages.This would not be an issue normally - you can install the driver from a PC.It is the principle that a company can maintain a manufacturer's description while not the web page to support the claim...You know a manufacturer is a scumbag when their feedback/survey link gives you an error message back...If any doubts read the blackberry link from the bottom of the review page or click on the one star reviews. A shame
0	It seems that this keyboard acts a little like those gold fish you bring home in a plastic bag from the pet shop.  You have to put the whole bag in the tank until it acclimates to it's new surroundings.  I went from wanting to love the thing for the sheer coolness factor....to boxing it up to send back when it wouldn't sync to my Axim x50v....to giving it another chance and after it was good and ready to work flawlessly I now love it again.  The keyboard is smaller than standard but very useable.  It's great for writing a longer e-mail inputting contacts or writing a letter in word when you don't want to peck at the screen with your stylus endlessly.  The construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap.  Pun intended. The only major flaw is with the cradle that holds your PDA.  It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you.  But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just don't want to let go.  The plastic it's made out of doesn't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually.  Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim et al is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it's holding.  Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it. I previously gave it one star but now that it's acclimated and working I give it 4 only because of the cradle shortcoming or else it would have been a full 5.  I know it shows one star but Amazon wholdn't allow me to edit the scale.
4	Great sturdy design in every aspect. After pairing it features flawless instant connection to your device every time you open it. A keeper for long its quality shows it'll last for ages.I just wish iGO would start working on supporting Windows Mobile 6. It does perform as a keyboard should and it does carry out it's core functionality; but I can't find the drivers for my device or any other WM6 device for that manner. I am currently using similar ones which though do allow the device to work don't allow all function keys to carry their purpose or softkey support to be accurate.
4	I have infrared (IR) keyboards to use with my Palm Treo 650 and Palm TX. They don't work very well at least not for me. I had major problems with lag: characters I typed simply didn't make it to the screen.Taking a chance I bought the Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard . . . and I am very very impressed.Set-up is very quick and Stowaway's set-up software is simple to use. Reading the short user's manual (not the brief Quick Start) is a must. The learning curve isn't steep but because the keyboard is intended as a universal device tweaks have to be made for using it with Palm or Pocket PC devices.Once set up the keyboard performs superbly well. Every key I struck showed up immediately onscreen. I have large hands and I was concerned that I would encounter many typos because of my large fingers. I needn't have worried. The keys have a firm touch and the spacing is wide enough to keep typos to a miniumum. Because of the immediate feedback provided by Bluetooth I felt no tendency to go back and retype because the character didn't show up. I had no idea that the IR keyboard with its lag was causing me to do that so much.Others have commented about instability because the ends of the keyboard are essentially unsupported. At first this struck me as a design flaw but within a few minutes this is easily compensated for. I had little difficulty with my keystrokes causing the keyboard to rock.Some have also complained about devices slipping off the minimal stand provided. I had no problems with the Treo 650 or Palm TX.Finally a number of people have complained that there is no fifth row for entry of numbers. You have to use a function key + number combination or you can set the keyboard to number lock. If you have to enter a lot of numeric data the complaints are justified. On the other hand for people like me who have limited need for numeric entry it is an inconvenience but not a major one. I'm happy to trade a fifth row for numerics for the small size of the unit.Construction of the unit is typical for many of today's products. It's plastic with some metal but overall it does not feel like it is built like a tank. On the other hand it doesn't feel overy flimsy either. Time and use will tell how well the unit stands up.Overall this unit makes it eminently possible to use handheld devices like the Treo 650 and Palm TX for serious typing. I was surprised to find that I could type almost as rapidly on this keyboard as I can on a full-sized unit. The Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard is a very slick piece of work and well worth the cost for anyone who wants to use their smartphone or PDA for typing more than a few words.
4	Once you get a keyboard for your pda / smart phone you won't go back. This keyboard communicates via bluetooth and does a great job at turning your small device into a productive tool you won't want to be without. I use this keyboard with my Palm TX and it does a fabulous job during meetings - it's small (smaller than a notebook) VERY portable and reliable. the entire keyboard as well as my Palm PDA fits into the pant pocket of my cargo pants / shorts. You really can't get much more portable than that.To use you invoke a 3-button key combination to help it initiate contact with your device. Once connected you'll be off and running. My Palm TX will only stay on at 1-3 minute intervals so the only thing I don't like about this combination is that I have to keep hitting a key once in a while so my Palm doesn't shut off. This of course is a design flaw of the TX and not reflective of the keyboard.
4	This keyboard fills my left pocket and my Ultra mobile PC phone fills my right pocket.  This keyboard allows me to type at normal speed on a device I can keep in my pocket and I was astonished to see that it would have even worked for text messaging on my older phone the Nokia N-Gage.  If you have any HTC phone or any phone that supports bluetooth or this keyboard or even a PDA I highly recommend this product although it is costly.  Pair it with anything that can run TextMaker Office for WindowsMobile and you have a meeting powerhouse in your pocket that can tackle the best college note taking in a much more mobile manner than a laptop since you don't need to take it out of a bag plug it in and otherwise waste time.  I also suggest pairing it with the mouse by the same company for the same purpose.
4	I have an older PDA (Dell Axim X50) and this keyboard works great! The connection is Bluetooth and was easy to set up.  It is compact when folded up and very light yet feels fairly sturdy and responsive when typing.
4	The iGO bluetooth keyboard works great. The only complaint is the extreme left and right tips a little when typing.
4	For the money this is a great item and a must have for mobile road warriors. I am using the iGo keyboard with a Blackberry Curve (8300).Like others have said there is a nasty sticker that covers both the outside cover and the keys that may never completely come off. When peeling it off the keys it feels like the keys will rip off their fragile posts.Also as is common with Bluetooth getting the two devices to communicate with one another can be tricky. I haven't used it a lot yet so maybe I haven't figured out the right combination of button presses. But I hate when things don't simply work.The keyboard is fairly solid and certainly easy to type on especially if you're accustomed to typing on a laptop. The keys are marked with several shortcut functions to launch tasks or apps.This is a great item for anyone who wants a lightweight substitute for traveling with a laptop. While sitting in a hotel room checking e-mail this is all you need.
4	I purchased this keyboard so that I could start doing some serious word processing on my Treo 650 and I've been absolutely pleased!First off the keyboard does not come with the Treo 650 driver --- you must DOWNLOAD THIS DRIVER OFF OF THINK OUTSIDE'S websiteHowever downloading the driver is easy and from there you can sync it to your Treo or email it in an attachment to itOnce the drive is installed the keyboard is flawless!My biggest complaint about BlueTooth keyboards is that they lag as you type ---- but this is not the case with the Stowaway --- every key I pressed showed up INSTANTLY upon my Treo 650So far it has worked terrificly with my address book calendar and email (VersaMail)In addition the keyboard folds together well and is EXTREMELY thin and portable ---- I don't know if you could carry it in a pocket - but a backpack briefcase etc will not feel any extra weight with this productlastly - these keyboards are small --- I wish the delete key was bigger (as I often make typos) but nonetheless I'm very happy and certainly typing on this quicker than the phone's keyboardhighly recommended!HAPPY TYPING! HAPPY BUYING!
4	Originally created for use with Palm devices the iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard for PDAs and Handhelds is still among the best folding nearly full-sized Bluetooth keyboards available. Its metal case and relatively simple folding mechanism result in a durable product that has given me years of reliable service. The keyboard feels great; the throw of the keys is nice and tactile feedback is on a par with many laptop keyboards. My fingers are none too slim and they easily fit on to this keyboard. Like many of us these days I'm a touch typist and I find using this keyboard as comfortable as any I might find particularly on most laptop computers. I've owned a couple of these - not because they wear out (I still own and use the first one I purchased nearly a decade ago) - but because I find it's useful to have one at my bedside and another in my gear bag.Powered by AAA batteries makes it easy to operate. There's no proprietary power source or charging system required. It sips power too; I find it lasts and lasts on a pair of NiMH rechargeable batteries.Pairing with a phone or other device is very simple. However my Symbian phones do not handle this as they should any authorized peripheral. I have to manually connect; I cannot just turn the keyboard on and start to type in order to get the keyboard and phone to connect. I suspect this a deficiency with the Symbian OS and not with the keyboard.The folding stand is very useful and fits a variety of devices of roughly phone-size in either a portrait or landscape configuration.Even without its zippered case this keyboard travels very nicely and has a durable aluminum shell.Why didn't I give this a perfect 5-star rating? The keypad is available I think only with the functions of the old Palm OS mapped on to the keys. It doesn't undermine the use of the keyboard with other operating systems but can sometimes be distracting that the keys are printed with functions either not available on your phone's operating system or the keys cannot actually perform that function.I find it very unfortunate that most so-called smart phones do not support mapping special functions on to Bluetooth keyboards. Admittedly this is not a shortcoming of the keyboard itself. Phone manufacturers are simply more interested in equipping their systems with eye-candy and games rather than the kinds of productivity enhancements which might make their devices more useful to those of us who try to rely upon them to aid is in our work and home lives.It is astonishing to me that this keyboard isn't more popular and being emulated by other manufacturers. It would be terrific if it were to ship with software that could enable iOS Android and Symbian devices to map functions to its keys.I highly recommend this keyboard if you are looking for a durable reliable and comfortable folding Bluetooth keyboard for your handheld device.
4	It is so funny watching text fly into my T-Mobile SDA smartphone (aka iMate SP5m or HTC Tornado) using the Stowaway keyboard. This keyboard is all class: just like a laptop keyboard with the same spring to the keys quality durability and lovely looks to boot.Entering numbers is get-used-to'able however symbols such as () and & or % can be a major pain due to the fact that a) you have to use custom key commands using ctrl fn1 and fn2 buttons and b) if you are an experienced typer you already know the motion for & or * or () and you'll find yourself doing them! (meaning you are incorrect on this keyboard)That said entry is obviously very fast and natural as this is a proper keyboard just with some multi-purposed keys requiring key combos.The only solution is to FORCE yourself through it and just do it. You will get used to it just like you got used to fast touch-typing.Anyhow this thing is a gem for hammering out quick SMS text messages etc. I mean no more click-click-click clack-clack click-click-click-click clack-clack to type out a single four-letter word. Nothing feels quite like that lol!This thing will fit EASILY in a purse and will fit in a men's pant pocket. I wear shorts pants etc. and it fits fine.The keyboard clicks are quite silent. I use this in class to quicly type out extensive class notes as I can type far faster (and more legibly) than I can hand-write.The case is durable sandblasted aluminum (like my old minidisc player) and the detachable device stand is sweet! I use it all the time to put my phone on one of those little chair-mounted desks in class and type in my lap. Sweet!Anyhow is this thing essential? I mean I kinda hate not having a notebook around when in say a statistics class with graphs and stuff...you can't draw graphs with this thing very well. However for text-based notes in a college setting this thing is well worth it. A smartphone as above and a keyboard and you have one of THE major functions of a laptop but without having to carry a laptop. Just the phone you'd have anyways and this flat little thing.NOTE: if you have troubles reconnecting this thing use the bluetooth connect on your phone first then use the special driver provided by Think Outside to finish the connection. Two part process.In all I am a college student and I wish I did not have to pay over $80 for this unit (why can't they make it for $30?) but in the end this thing is slightly sweeter than it's price so it's worth it.
0	I struggled with trying to get this thing to work with my Blackberry 8700g for some time.  I even selected and downloaded a driver that was listed for Blackberry devices on the product web site.  After a lot of frustration I finally got my Blackberry to pair with the keyboard but it would still not recognize it when I tried to get it to link to it.  I contacted iGo product support and they informed me that: Unfortunately we do not have a driver for that device currently.  So I ended up wasting a lot of time on this keyboard that is supposedly for Blackberry and other PDA/Handhelds.By the way the carton itself does not state that it works with Blackberry devices only with Smartphones.  A fairly obscure barcode sticker on the back does indicate in small letters that it also works for Blackberry.  In my case though back it goes which really is a shame because I like the quality of the item otherwise and I am sure I could have made good use of it.  In the mean time I guess I'll keep looking.Lastly I also agree with the other reviewer who vented about the stupid sticker they place on the unit.  It is glued to the keyboard and to the front surface and is quite a pain to remove.
4	I bought this to work with a Palm T3 years ago. They never produced good Palm drivers so it was pretty much worthless. It's been sitting in a drawer for five years and some of the keys stick but they can be prised up with the corner of a credit card. The keyboard syncs cleanly with an iPad 2 and if you can tolerate the way it rocks back and forth as you type it works fine.
4	It always worries me when devices like this are still being sold at retail while third party sellers are able to sell them for under what wholesale would seem to be for the stated retail price. Usually this reflects a liquidation by the manufacturer. But sometimes that allows you to try a gadget that you otherwise might not be able to afford. And if you need the gadget for its originally designed purpose it may well be just what you want despite being obsolescent. It is pure speculation on my part but I believe that the market need now requires F1-F12 keys and this device does not have them.I've considered PDA keyboards before but they always impressed me as flimsy junk not possibly able to stand up to the rigors of travel or even more than occasional use. This one is different - I believe that if I put it in its little paddded bag it could go into my black bag and come out after 6 trips two weeka later in the same shape ready to go when I needed it.  The aluminum construction seems as solid as it poaaibly can for a folding device.When I look at the support forums for the device on the manufacturer's web site I see that people are asking about support for portable windows devices.  This keyboard has no traditional windows function keys (originally F1-F10 now (and for many years) F1-F12) [Sidebar: Why 12?  Because that is how many the IBM 3270 a special purpose mainframe terminal used by the designers had] and without those you probably can't use it effectively with windows. I paired it with my laptop and I was able to use it as a keyboard without special drivers.  Probably with a great free program called anyhotkey I could get it to simulate the sending of pfks using extra non-momentary shifts but why?  A wireless or wired full sized keyboard is what you need on a system like this.I had no trouble getting used to left (blue) function shifting for numbers and right (green) function shifting for top line punctuation although I wish the silk screening had been against an ivory background and not the gunmetal grey one.  While it might be possible for a driver to use multiple shifts to simulate F1-F12 what then about shifted keys? If the shift to get F4 includes a chord with the alt key how would you then type alt-F4? The only possible way I could see was if this was something that you got by pushing both blue and green shifts and the top line but if you then accidentally hit cntl you'd put the keyboard into pairing mode.So I believe that they are as I write this available at a great price for their intended market - Palm PDAs Some Smartphones and such. But not having function keys limits this keyboard's future specifically Windows Mobile devices that can be used with a full Bluetooth keyboard won't be fully functional when you use this device as a keyboard.One other thing that I did was to try it with my PS3.  Works great and the PS3 does not use F1-F12 so this is probably the perfect occasional use keyboard for the PS3 - you can text with it or type addresses if you are surfing or use it for naming things without having to have a full sized keyboard wired to the PS3 (or a full sized bluetooth keyboard taking up space). Nothing special I just paired it and then typed the number the PS3 gave me on its screen.My main use for this is as a keyboard formy Palm T|X. I downloaded the drivers and synced the T|X.  I then went through setting up a secure connection. The only thing that I do not like (and I am not sure what to do about it) is that whenever I want to use the keyboard I can't just open it up and start using it. I have to open it go to applications start the keyboard application go into bluetooth configuration tell it to connect dismiss the warning that the keyboard has to be paired in the device list and then do the cntl-greenFN-blueFN chord to make the keyboard discoverable. Then it connects and the keyboard works and I can change to another application and the keyboard still works.This needs to be done often enough that I made an input area icon (the touchscreen areas that allow you to immediately bring up an application) start the keyboard app.I believe that this is an issue with the way the Palm OS works. Other systems don't seem to need this manual restart of the drivers.Once that is done so long as the palm does not need to be reset the keyboard will work as soon as it comes on - so long as you do not use another bluetooth device. According to the release notes the Palm Bluetooth support can only talk to one device at a time. If the keyboard is unused it will power down after a couple minutes. But when you touch a key it will resume communications immediately without going through the menu. No it is not a full sized keyboard and there are some compromises but it has a really good feel even compared to many full sized keyboards I own.When one opens the keyboard the first thing to do is to extend the palmtop support. The little arm that the palmtop rests on is spring loaded and pops past a stop - if you like it at that first stop be careful to block the rest with your thumb. There is a release on one side to open the keyboard a release on the top that holds the keyboard open and which needs to be released when you want to close it. Just go slow.There is a single feedback light.  Off? Keyboard is not connected. Fast blink? Keyboard is ready to connect. Slow blink? Keyboard is connected. Red? Low battery.Simple easy to use and works well. This is not a PC keyboard and it is not a heavy stationary keyboard. For what it is sold for it is best of breed.
4	I received the item in a timely manor but the best thing about this product was the outstanding response I received by the seller. It was an excellent purchase experience and excellent customer service.  I would buy from this seller again.  I was unable to make the item work with my blackberry 8310 and the seller provided me the opportunity to return it for a full refund however my life got busy and the time alloted to return it expired but that's my fault and not the seller.
4	Use it for my Nokia N95-3 and it works very well.A bit bulky since its not really pocketable but fits in any bags for easy transport.Great for using it on airplanes since it is small and will not take up the entire table.Some keys are very touchy since I noticed that the E button will press twice.All in all a very nice product!
2	I have the version designed and manufactured for Dell by Think Outside Inc.  It is the same as this product but the keys are black.  The keyboard works great.  The keyboard folds up flat and is about 4x6 and it is thin.  It folds out to a full size keyboard when opened the keyboard latches so it won't fold up when you are typing and the keys have a great feel.  Loading the software to my Axim x30 and configuring the keyboard went smoothly and although I am somewhat comfortable with technology  I am not a techie by any measure.  The bluetooth is great and there is no need to carry cables and wires and this option has worked well for me for the past two years.The only problem I have is with the stand.  The stand is made with very flimsy plastic; although the manual says that it is detachable I would recommend extreme caution. After two years of extremely careful treatment my stand broke.I don't know if Think Outside Inc. will sell me this plastic part (I plan to contact them) but Dell does not stock or sell this part even though it is detachable; it does not take a genius to see that this part will not wear well.  After being transferred to four departments and then told to call their parts store the fifth Dell customer service representative told me to either purchase a new keyboard for $99.00 or carry my cradle around.  This seems silly and wasteful.If you work from one location and can use your cradle to hold your Pocket PC this is not an issue.  But if like me you purchased this for travel and portability and do not take your cradle with you this is a problem.So this is a great product with the above exception.  As a consumer I hope that manufacturers begin to learn that when you purchase something like this you expect quality.  It should not only work well but hold up under normal use and parts should be made available and easy to find.-Feb. 21 2006Update:  I contacted Think Outside Inc. through their website.  They sent me two replacement stands free of charge.  The customer service department was nice and I got the stands within three business days.  Great customer service!-Feb. 24 2006Another Update:  I am still using the keyboard and it still works great and my replacement stand is holding up and I still have the extra they sent me.  I would purchase this again and I wish sellers like Dell knew to direct customers who experienced the problem I did to Think Outside for replacement parts.  They had excellent customer service unlike Dell (they wanted me to purchase another keyboard).-Sept. 15 2006
4	Great ideal for a product works perfectly and as advertised.  I just think its another item for the bag with the laptop when you are traveling.
4	Works great with my Moto Q.  Typing sound is annoying but easily turned off.I also caution that you should probably store the batteries uninstalled.  I put a brand new set of Duracells in it and they were dead a month later with almost no use (Just sitting in my briefcase)  I discovered this at the start of a 5 hour flight and fortunately was able to cannibalize a set from my MP3 player.  This only happened once so I can't say for sure that the keyboard sucked them dry.What really annoyed me was the Fold and unfold sticker which had some sort of industrial adhesive.  What a stupid thing to use.  It took me 25 minutes with cleaning solvent to get that darn thing off.  Also the black vinyl zippered pouch stinks like some toxic chemical.  If not for those two things I'd rate it 5 stars
4	Long battery life connects quickly to phone. Phone callers can't even tell I am on a BT headset no complaints of inablility to hear my voice will on a call. It is not for people with wide necks does not stretch much. Can slide back when active and the earphones are not in your ears. Otherwise light controls are easy to reach and distiguish. I have the similar LG HBS730 but prefer these due to the ease of finding the buttons you want but prefer the flexible neck of the LGs.
2	I have had an LG-700 for a few years and I love it.  But I get complaints from people about the microphone picking up extraneous noises when I am on the phone in a supermarket or working in the kitchen so when it started to wear out I tried this one.  Well....this does have pretty good sound BUT the rigid frame for the yoke is a problem for this guy with a 17.5 neck.  And the location of the on/off switch is annoying (on the back).  Plus whereas the LG-700 has 6 buttons this has 4 and the buttons are sorely missed for all of the needed functions of such a headset.  I often get the Equalization changed message when I am trying to get Siri to pop up...very annoying!  On the plus side it does seem to connect to my iPhone quickly and the signal seems pretty stable.All in all it is nice...but misses in a few ways.****************Update:  After 3 weeks I returned this to Amazon.  The fit was just too annoying.  Thank you Amazon for your great return policies!
4	Pros:1) Excellent call clarity and loudness both ways2) Excellent for listening to music3) Fits snugly and stays put around your neck while exercising (unlike the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730)4) Feels much better than theLG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 when in contact with your skinCons:1) Connectivity is not as good as with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 e.g. it does not connect to 2 devices as once and you have to first disconnect it from the device it's currently connected to before it connects to a new device. The LG does not have this annoying problem.2) The power button is located all the way in the back and it's awkward and difficult to power on or off  unlike theLG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7303) Does not vibrate when you receive a call4) Does not have easily accessible buttons like the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7305) Does not look as good as the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7306) Does not announce the battery level like the LG7) The battery life is good but subpar to the LGOverall this Bluetooth Headset offers excellent sound quality (as good as you get with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730) but overall it's very poorly and unintuitively designed compared with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 and does not have as good seamless and versatile connectivityI've had both for about a month and the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 is clearly the better headset overall.I will be returning this one mainly because I'm tired of the problematic connectivity and the very unintuitive design.
4	I bought these to replace my LG headset which kept dropping audio during phone calls.  The sound quality is very good.  It has a longer range than the LG. Overall very pleased.  The software that runs the headset is not as advanced as the LG it doesn't announce the battery level and it can only be connected to one device at a time.  When it announces it is connected if two of your devices have bluetooth on at the same time you don't know which one it is connected to because it does not identify the unit it is connected to.Overall though I like them a lot.  The sound quality is very important to me and I wear them a lot when I am listening to programs on netflix and for my day-to-day phone use.
4	I have been a fan of the LG HBS series since the amazingHBS-700and also own theHBS-730and the newHBS-800.With the SF500 Motorola has clearly taken a more than close look at the HBS series and attempted to improve on it. Here's how I find these two compare:- Battery life: Moto wins. This thing keeps on going and lasts even longer than the already amazing HBS-730. Too bad the remaining battery life estimator is so inaccurate (it reports 4 hours remaining on a full charge when it's much closer to 10)- Convenience and durability: Moto wins again. The Buds sit tight around your neck and don't bounce. The cords are not as fragile on the LGs and the magnets holding the earbuds are much stronger on the Moto Buds. Unlike the HBS-730 and 800 the Buds do not report their power level to the Bluetooth host (the iPhone shows a little bar next to the bluetooth icon indicating the battery status when you use the LG headphones). That's funny since the older SF600 have the feature.- Ergonomy: LG wins big time. The button layout and functionality are intuitive and logical on the LG and completely convoluted and inconvenient on the Buds; on the Buds the same button is used for FF (one press) or REW (two presses); also the power button on the LG is a sliding switch whereas the Buds use an electronic switch which makes it much more difficult to find out if your headset is on or off.- Sound quality: I would rate the Buds somewhere between the 700 and the 730; mostly they lack bass and presence.- Range: excellent but the outlandish 150ft range advertised is only available when connected to a Bluetooth Class 1 device and these are rare -- only featured on a few Motorola phones as far as I could tell. When connected to a Class 2 device (which most devices are) the range is 33ft like all other devices; I think Motorola is a little disingenuous when advertising this extended range.In conclusion... They're not bad and if the LG series didn't exist they would deserve 5 stars. However considering they're a blatant rip-off of a successful concept it's disappointing that Motorola improved on some of the flaws of the HBS series (mostly the cord durability and the magnet strength) but failed to pick up on the ergonomy (button layout power switch).Which one should you pick? in my opinion the cheapest one you can find unless you need to connect to two devices in which case the Moto Buds or the HBS-800 are a must; and if you easily get irritated and confused by complicated controls stay away from the Buds.Recommended but they're not the LG HBS-series killer that Motorola probably designed them to be.
2	I was hoping for a blue tooth that will connect to more than one phone. I already had the LG and was hoping the Motorola would do better but I was let down. It is a great buy if you are only using one cell phone.
4	The headset sounds excellent.  The earbuds will not aggravate your ears when they are in... even for long lengths of time.  I would definitely recommend these.
4	Update: I've been asked how they hold up with sweat (see below). No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER since you asked they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal.  BATTERY: I've used them every day since I got them and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym.  They last from morning to night constantly connected.  I often forget I'm wearing them when I turn on my music and don't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.Edit: just for the record the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.=============================================================I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend and I've used them several times so that is my comparison point.These headphones have a very utilitarian price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT they are very easy to control very light and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy JVC etc.)The ear pieces at first I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces so every time you move you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice because of the magnets. No flopping around.The built-in equalizer settings are nice the controls are easy and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds but you get a great ease of use very good sound and less than half the price.And truthfully while they aren't super stylish... People are walking around with those giant beats studio headphones on. These look way less ridiculous than that and really aren't that bad. Don't wear them to a job interview.
0	Pro'sUnit has great range.Comfortable in the ears can wear it all day.Battery life is awesome.Mute function make this very useful for someone that spends a lot of time on the conference calls.Con'sLasted two months and now will not turn on anymore. Trying to get motorola to fix it but no help so far.Audio books may have issues. The headset will cut out during short pauses and makes you lose out on a few seconds of the story as it reconnects. Only certain books caused this behavior.If it did not quit on me I would certainly recommend it as a phone headset.
4	I can walk away father than the next leading one and it doesn't fade out even thru some of my thickest walls
2	It's so so.  Not as comfortable as advertised and hugs your neck which i hate.  Has great sound but  is quite plain. I own an older LG model bigger for guys my size.... Has more control buttons for the different functions compared to the 2 buttons the Motorola has.The off/on button is in a bad place every time I lay on the bench to lift weights I lay on the button which shuts it off ...Poor design. I wouldn't say not to buy it but a gadget person as myself I prefer the LG so I returned the Motorola and ordered a newer LG model ..
4	These ear buds are just wonderful.  Let's you listen privately to anything you need to and still participate in daily activities.  I would highly recommend.
4	I bought these after TWO sets of LG Tones broke on me. I like these a lot. Very comparable to the Tones. What was most important to me was battery life. I used these for listening to sports and talk radio. I have wired buds for listening to music. The only two complaints I have with this item is: the neck band is kinda tight in comparison to the Tone. Not as easy to get on and off. However they don't move around as much as the Tone's. My second complaint: the on/off. I have to take the headset off to access the switch. The Tone's switch is a much better setup and easily accessible. All in all I would recommend these. I am hoping the quality is better than that of the LG Tone.
4	VERY COMFORTABLE CLEAR VOLUME AND GREAT FITTTING AROUND YOUR NECK. DON'T TURN AROUNDYOUR NECK AS MUCH AS THE LG. GREAT
2	I lost my 2-year-old LG Tone HBS-700 headset and someone else is doubtless enjoying it.The Motorola cables appeared to be more robust than the LG cables and the price point was attractive compared to the newest LG HBS-800 so I decided to take a chance.The good:- price- earbud fit- strong cables- battery life- reception- button function and placement- pairing- telephone functionThe bad:- looks goofy- the band is a tight fit- two-tone cable color may as well be illuminated with a sign that says look at me!The mediocre:- sound quality (richness and frequency response) simply cannot match the LG Tone HBS series- equalizer is not very effective (bright treble but non-existent bass)Summary:This product is inferior to the LG where it counts:  the sound.  For me that is sufficient reason to warrant return of this product and purchase of the newest and ridiculously expensive LG Tone HBS-800.  I am returning the Motorola this week but I will delay my purchase of the LG until the price becomes more reasonable.  In the meantime I'll get by with a wired pair of earbuds.
4	My LG HBS-730 that I use for bike rides with no problem.  Recently the route I took has a lot of interference from the near by power lines and tower.  Music from LG glitches so much that I can't enjoy my music anymore.  I also have a Plantronics BackBeat Go 2.  This one is a little bit better but my music still glitches and break up at the area with the most interference.  My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and it's stored in my bike jersey back pocket which is less than two feet from the headset.Before I try this unit I went and try a LG HBS-750 (one user review said it has less interference).  HBS-750 was worst.  It started to break up even before I enter the interference area.I finally give this one a try.  Wow I don't know what kind of power they use I had three rides so far and I haven't experience one single glitch yet.  No music break up no phone call conversation break up.  It's so nice to finally have some uninterrupted music.I problem I had was that once time I receive a phone call and the party on the other side couldn't hear me.  I don't know if it's the other party or the headset.  The party calls me back and this time when I press the pickup button the headset doesn't respond with button push.The sound is very awesome as well.  I say the bass is better that the HBS-730.  The magnet is stronger as well.  I like it when I tuck the unit behind my shirt and when I am not using the ear plug and let it dangles it naturally falls down and attached itself back to the magnet of the unit ... through my shirt.  This keep the earplug from swinging back and forth when I am not using it.  I don't know if this is by design or just accident.  Either way it's cool.
4	SPOILER ALERT: this is a stupidly long review. I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review because that&#8217;s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we&#8217;ve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers&#8217; remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee or skip to the end or skip this review entirely &#61514;  Seriously though it&#8217;s a long review. Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound features fit and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when I&#8217;m at work underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt but aren&#8217;t too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this &#8220;one device at a time&#8221; thing improves the handoff between music and calls since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently I&#8217;ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone my iPod and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each device&#8217;s settings) so I don&#8217;t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch &#8211; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I've got that out of the way I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds which is pretty much everything. First off let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio making it sound somewhat muddled and well bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3 S4 and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8) but there are others out there as well. If you&#8217;re interested there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesse&#8217;s page by searching for &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X) but didn't like the &#34;flat loop&#34; design that most of them have &#8211; it looks like a great fit&#8230; for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative to the neck band and they carry all the weight of the battery so they&#8217;ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds but are $70 more expensive). I&#8217;m wearing the Buds headset right now and can hardly feel it &#8211; a great improvement over traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; Bluetooth headsets. While I&#8217;m talking about fit I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5&#8221; collar and can&#8217;t stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsung&#8217;s S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons but it&#8217;s easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right which come to think of it is a whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221; since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the &#8220;Play/Pause&#8221; switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes but there is no indication of which one you are in or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of &#8220;EQ mode changed!&#8221; but that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat treble boost and bass boost. As a general &#8220;audiophile&#8221; rule flat EQ response is best since it doesn&#8217;t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost but can&#8217;t tell the difference between the other two. And if I can&#8217;t tell the difference then I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter. I&#8217;d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music getting to an EQ setting you like and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don&#8217;t attach it to the end of the stalk I&#8217;ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I&#8217;ve been moving around. Needless to say don&#8217;t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes I&#8217;m really impressed. The earbuds are said to have &#8220;Premium HD speakers&#8221; and whatever that truly means they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don&#8217;t support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that &#8220;sparkle&#8221; is added in any way but if the music has fine detail in it then you&#8217;ll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly the documentation talks a bit about about &#8220;micro-adjustability&#8221; and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud&#8217;s body can change a bit to fit different peoples&#8217; ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as &#8220;sweat proof&#8221; which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily and do a lot of biking and walking and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways back to audio quality: One important thing to note which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren&#8217;t the best and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they&#8217;re also masking the fine detail of better quality files so in a way it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well and I&#8217;ve never had anyone ask &#8220;Are you using Bluetooth?&#8221; which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?&#8221; and almost didn&#8217;t believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality &#8211; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmp&#8217;s EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25% but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume but since these things get plenty loud on their own I don&#8217;t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples&#8217; ears make them look like extras from bad 80&#8217;s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port so it&#8217;s not visible at all while they&#8217;re being worn. I have to say at first I wasn&#8217;t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords the silicone ear pieces and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like it&#8217;s trying too hard. As I said it practically disappears under a polo collar &#8211; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When you&#8217;ve got an earbud inserted the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you&#8217;re either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say &#8220;a little&#8221; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I&#8217;m in mid conversation. I have to make the universal &#8220;I&#8217;m not a lunatic I&#8217;m just on the phone&#8221; gesture to most folks but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue which makes me even more sad that they don&#8217;t come in red. You see I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science in which I have an overwhelming love (some like my wife would say &#8220;unhealthy obsession&#8221;) for black things with red trim or red things with black trim or&#8230;  well you get the idea. If these came in red I&#8217;d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don&#8217;t really fit in the review elsewhere so I&#8217;ll stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet but that is with a &#8220;Class 1 Bluetooth device&#8221; which your phone probably isn&#8217;t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don&#8217;t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good and although I try to charge the headset every night I&#8217;ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. They&#8217;re rated at &#8220;up to 12 hours&#8221; of playback but it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes &#8211; small medium and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me you don&#8217;t want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds&#8217; voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you&#8217;ll hear as you turn the headset on and off or change EQ settings and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says &#8220;Welcome to the Motorola Buds!&#8221; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player the same voice says &#8220;Device 1 connected!&#8221; The voice isn&#8217;t too bad but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone&#8217;s ringtone. I think it&#8217;s a riff on the first few notes of &#8220;Ride of the Valkyries&#8221; but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft &#8220;bloop&#8221; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these &#8220;bloop&#8221; noises there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don&#8217;t know what power state it&#8217;s in hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own which is a first for all the headsets I&#8217;ve owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive since I could not get it to &#8220;pop back in&#8221; so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there wiped off the excess and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago and it has not popped back up yet.So that&#8217;s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I&#8217;ve made since I got them. If you&#8217;ve read through all that I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary which I promised at the start:For the tl;dr crowd I wholly approve of this headset. It&#8217;s the headset I&#8217;ve been waiting quite some time for and it&#8217;s finally here. Features fit sound and looks are all pretty much perfect and it&#8217;s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this it&#8217;s available here for $58 which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800 which normally goes for $130. Check these out &#8211; I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be disappointed.
4	An excellent device works great and fits well in your ear .... truly useful while driving and when you have your phone in your pocket. Was shipped well and in time by amazon
2	This bluetooth did not last me a year.  I called Motorola for a replacement.  They sent another model and I've been using it for four years now.
2	It worked good for a few months.  Gradually it began loosing its quality. People have trouble hearing now.  I am also getting static and cannot use very much.  Works a little better in my cell phone than Skype.  Overall I do not reccommend it.
2	When I first received this product it worked well.  After a month and a half it stopped communicating with my cell phone. I called Motorola and they told me it was guaranteed for a year and to send it back to them. The model I bought is no longer sold and they have a new one out now. They told me they will replace the blue tooth. It has been over 3 weeks since I mailed it in and I have yet to hear anything. I am happy with the blue tooth technology. But I am not happy with Motorola. They have never contacted me since I called them about the prolems I was having and have not even taken the time to e-mail be they received my old one (which I know they have by my shipping receipt I got back). My blue tooth may have been a lemon but Motorola's customer service is not up where it should be. I am still waiting for a replacement to come in. In the meantime I am using the free plug-in type I received when I bought my phone.  My advice is Buy a Bluetooth just be careful who makes it and check out their customer service.
4	I was very happy with my HS820 for the first 3 weeks. It was comfortable and transmission was good. UNfortunately it was defective and stopped transmitting.  I am giving it a good rating based on the performance up until it stopped working.
0	It won't work with my phone. After 2 hours I got it to connect but it won't answer when I get calls or turn on when I want to make them. Plus there were obvious scuff marks on the device. It's made of cheap plastic and the charger has the old-fashioned two-prong adaptor. I'm going to start looking for a better device ... especially one that charges with the universal USB adaptor so I don't have to carry multiple cords with me.
4	I just love this bluetooth headset. It was so easy to pair up with my new Sidekick 3. I did not have to do anything except charge the headset and then turn it on. Thanks again Amazon.com for providing me another great product at such a great price. The sound quality is outstanding. People on the other end just know that I am talking on a landline phone until I tell them that I am on a Bluetooth wireless headset and they are astounded. I highly recommend this headset to anyone looking for a brilliant headset at an excellent price. The Motorola HS 820 is the bomb!!!
2	It's a great deal so i jumped on it. But was truly disappointed. I've so far summed up Motorola products as well really really poor. I own a Razar wish i could return that! But this headset thinking it's from motorola would work well with my phone but no. It's on my belt clip and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away signal is weak and then disconnets. To me that's strange. It's also surprising that this happens randomly so it's kinda annoying b/c you can't anticipate it. Kinda annoying when driving b/c you rely on the headset to work properly. Also get the static noise which is weird b/c it shouldn't do that. especially when driving.
4	This was my first foray into the BT department. I first had this paired to a Moto v551 then later to a RAZR v3 Silver and Black. The only shortcoming I can find is the method used to turn the unit on and off. There are times you think you have the headset turned off but in reality you just redialed the last person called. The HS850 is a better designe here but thats the only one up the 850 has on this headset. The volume and fitment of this 820 are much better than on the 850. I have only had 1 signal related issue and that was due to me being too far away from the phone. Overall a great buy!
0	a couple problems with this headset when using it with the Treo 650 -1. it does not automatically connect when a call is received or initiated2. the volume is way too lowcheck out the Jabra JX10 Cardo Scala or Palm Treo headset ---- there are too many great headsets out there to settle for this onehappy shopping!
4	I have to think that some of the other reviewers have older phones and therefore problems with the unit. It's my first bluetooth headset but I couldn't be happier.P.S. People dissin' it because it doesn't work 25 feet from the phone or because it doesn't stay on your head when jogging? I guess I'm not as adventurous with my cell phone as some others...
4	Bought one then a second one I'm impressed my phone is by the same vendor and I think it is... the worst phone I've ever had but  this headset is comfortable and works with my phone and my wife's LG faultlessly.Be aware that there is no mute button you'll have to use the phone for that.Lasted 1/2 of a year now junk will no longer hold a charge
0	I am not impressed.I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking. This device does not cancel out background noise. Listeners on the other end say I sound like I'm in a tunnel. Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one's mouth and the pinhole for the internal microphone. There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise. This is a defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking. The ear attachment and its hinge is made of flimsy plastic. As a result the fit isn't tight enough. I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing's going to fly off my head into the back seat. It's an extremely annoying distraction that you don't want to have while driving.On the good side I don't have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use.
2	I've used a number of Bluetooth headsets and this is among the worst. The sound quality is low especially outdoors and there is quite a bit of static even when within a few feet of the phone. The volume is poor - even with the volume cranked up to the top I could barely hear the other party indoors and outside (with any background noise) it was almost impossible. This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear (earbud style). The microphone is far enough from one's mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable especially if you wear glasses but not as bad as some others I've tried. It does not flop around much under normal circumstances. I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500 which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I'm going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250. I've used those in the past and found them much better overall and worth the extra price.
0	I used have one of this earpeice 2 years ago and I lost it so I ordered this since this is much much cheaper than my previous one.Different from the previous peice this item came in with extremely cheap package and it's sound quality is worse than my previous one. My friends complained about the ECHO and noise sometimes so I suspect if this is actually a refurbed one. Sometimes the manufacturer sell such items for much less with simplized packaging.
2	This is my first BT headset. The main reasons I chose this one were low price small size/weight and having seen a couple of people use this at work.Pros:The size/weight is so small as to be unnoticeable. I find the headset very comfortable for extended periods of time. Price-wise it was the cheapest headset from a reputable brand when I bought it. Battery life is decent probably 3+ days although I tend to charge it about every two days. Great for driving or any time you want your hands free but can't use speakerphone.Cons:People whom I call have complained occasionally about the sound quality. Range is not great sometimes 10 ft causes annoying I am about to disconnect noise. Because there is only one main button that is used for everything it is very easy to accidentally activate voice dialing last-number redial etc. Initial pairing with the phone was not intuitive at all: who knew you had to keep the button pressed while trying to pair up? Finally the blinking blue light on you temple makes you look like a robot!Recommendation:This is an OK first/small/cheap BT headset. If you talk a lot on the phone look for something else. There must be headsets out there that provide better sound quality longer range and have more intuitive buttons and controls.
4	It is not the greatest  The sounds works fine on most calls.  it is not very good on call overseas.  people don't hear very well.  However I am mostly satisfied with it.
4	Excellent sound quality and easy to pair. Looked just as the ad said and the shipping was right on the money.
4	I'm using mine with the Jabra A210 non-bluetooth phone adapter and it works fine. I've used it in the office on my cellphone (handsfree allows me to type and talk with no wires) I use it in the car and it gives me great movement without wires. Very small clips around the ear and you don't even realize its there. Very pleased with this unit. I charge it overnight and it works all day from 530am till 11pm constantly receiving calls. I've had this for a about a week and I'll leave it on this weekend to see just how long it will last before running out of gas. I'm pleased with the quality of the Microphone and Earpiece. Can't believe just how well the mic works. I can shout and whisper and the volume is constant. This is my first bluetooth earpiece and I'm happy with it ! Some calls have slight distortion but since other calls are crystal clear I have to believe its the cellphone connection and not the earpiece.
4	This headset works fine. It fits perfectly over the ear. Volume isgreat! connects quickly. No echooo. Maybe all the nay sayers need abetter cell phone. I've tried three bluetooth devices and the HS820 isfar superior to the rest.
4	I bought this headset for probably the same reason most people did the price. For 30 bucks and from a reliable company you can't go wrong. I got what I paid for. The sound quality and the mic quality are both decent enough at least for someone who isn't obsessive about how crystal clear the reception is. It has a tendency to drop the connection sometimes for no apparent reason annoying at times but not very common.About a month after use it stopped working for no explicit reason. I sent it back and got a replacement from Motorola. However only a month or so after that I seemed to have misplaced it and had pretty much thought it was lost.Today about a month and a half later I found it in my dryer. Apparently it had been in the pocket of one of my jeans that I hadn't washed for a while and it went through a whole wash and dry cycle. Happy that I found it but I all but gave up on it to work again. I gave it a shot anyway and lo and behold it did start charging. So after an hour I tried pairing it with my phone and voila IT STILL WORKS! I was stunned. Not only that a bluetooth headset could go through that abuse and still function like new but a headset that seems relatively cheap and outdated!So based on my first experience it was a 2 but any piece of electronic equipment that can survive a wash and dry HAS to get two more stars in my book. Reliable and saved me from shelling out more money for a more expensive replacement. It gets the job done.
4	I always thought it was obnoxious to leave your headset on all the time but now i know why people do it. One you forget you have it on and two it's kind of a pain in the neck to setup. This particular product is pretty good it pairs up well with my RAZR after saying yes to no less than three questions and works very well. The only complaint I have is it could be louder but it serves my purpose.
4	I love this headset.  It's light has good voice quality louder earpiece volume than the phone itself (Mot V710) and the battery outlasts the phone.  A previous reviewer mentioned having to carry 2 chargers.  Motorola makes a Y adapter so you can charge both your phone and headset from 1 charger.  I think I paid under $10 for it but don't quote me.  I love the headset but when I'm in an airport it picks up the background noise as loudly as my voice.  If it was noise canceling it would have gotten 5 stars.  One last note: My phone doesn't ring when connected to the headset so you must have the headset on to know you have an incoming call.  This is a complaint about the phone though not the headset.Update 03-05-2005I just bought an HS-810 because I keep getting complaints of background noise being louder than my voice.  I like it better but the 820 does have better incoming sound quality.  But all in all I like the 810 much better.  The flip open design is especially nice.  Search for the HS810 to see my complete review.Update 07-21-2005My Motorola V710 went in the dunk a few months ago so I had to buy a new one.  The new software allows the phone to ring even when the headset is connected.  Much better.
4	I got this as a Christmas present for my brother and he absoultely loves it. When talking to him it sounds very clear and there is no static. It is a much better than my Jabra headset which cost nearly twice the price.
2	I bought this from Amazon. I linked quickly and worked as advertised.  I found the various button modes difficult to keep track of and found it a real problem over time.My biggest complaint is that this device is too too quiet at maximum volume.  Obviously Motorola did not test their design in a car that had some road noise.  I found it only adequate in a quiet room.  I suspect it is the fact that the speaker is a long way from the ear canal.  I am wondering if an in ear type will be better in the long run.Save you money on this one if you plan to use it in a car.  It is fine if your sitting in quiet room.
0	This thing just doesn't work well with the Treo 6501. it doesn't automatically connect when a call comes or when a call is initiated2. the volume is way too lowthe comfort is good but for the price there are many BETTER headsets out there ----consider the Cardo Scala the Jabra JX10 and the Palm Treo headset - those are your best betshappy shopping!
0	I am not impressed.I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking.  This device does not cancel out background noise.  Listeners on the other end say I sound like I'm in a tunnel.

4	At first I was a bit leary about buying one of these because I had heard that they were never loud enough unless you were in a very quiet place. NOT TRUE! I have to say I've had to turn down the volume on this before! Now don't take that out of context but this is a great product. I live in Texas and drive a loud truck and I've been able to use this product driving down the road! I would definitely recommend this product. A great purchase for the money.
4	This is a great cable for me !!I love using it in my car.I connect it to my smartphone to listen to my radio app while I am traveling out of town.Once I lose  range of my favorite  radio station I plug it in and  continue listening  to my favorite radio station thru the app. .Great deal !
0	Don't purchase these if you plan to use in your car. The side walls are too thin and if this lays next to any 12 power source my Sirus Radio in my case you'll get the electrical whine as the cars rpm's increase and decrease. You get what you pay for.
4	It does what it's supposed to.  Hook up my cell phone to my car so I can listen to my mp3.  I'm not a audio geek/master so I don't know if it's a good decibel or crisp bass or tremble but songs seems to play well.
0	Received it plugged it in didn't work. Tried jostling the cable and plug around couldn't get it to work. Can't recommend it.
4	I bought one for my dad to use occasionally and tested it for a couple songs and had no issues like others have had maybe I'm not using it as long. It is cheaper feeling than my more expensive ones. I will update this if things change.
4	We bought this item to replace a broken 3.5 mm cable we use to connect our FM modulator to our iPhone 4s.  We needed something with a thin piece of rubber over the plug so that it didn't catch on the after-market case on our iPhones.  this product worked great and the price was excellent.
0	Bought this as a line-in cable for my in-dash stereo from my cell phone. The cable does not work. I only get sound out of one side of the stereo when it's fully plugged in. In order to hear stereo i need to hold cable out to before the spring click. Unfortunately this doesn't suit my needs for the car.
4	The price was good and the cable works great. It seems to be well made. There isn't much else to say about this product.
4	This is a basic cable.  It works and it is cheap.  There is not much else you can say about it.
4	The concept of the phone is terrific.  I have to use a 2-way pager for work and instead of carting around a cell phone and bulky pager I now just have this one small item.  And while I didn't think I'd really use it the Bluetooth functionality has definitely sold me.  I can use it not only for a wireless headset but to connect to the internet and to transfer sound files back and forth as well.The software of the phone seems to be a bit buggy still unfortunately.  When I lock the keypad I still sometimes hear tones when the keypad is pressed and the display lights up.  The menus are sometimes slow to respond delaying as much as 2 full seconds (doesn't sound like much but it can be irritating).Overall I'd buy the phone again without hesitation but I'm an early adopter.  If you're willing to put up with the occassional buggy behavior I'd definitely recommend this phone.
2	If you have large hands ( like me ) you will find the keyboard difficult to use. I had particular difficulty with the 5-way directional button. No matter how carefully I used the button I ended up hitting the adjacent buttons too. I also had problems using the camera feature because of it's tiny size. However in the interest of full disclosure I am a bit of a klutz. I was also displeased to find that the unit's limited memory made any real web browsing impossible. Also there appears to be no Bluetooth compatibility with Macs. It will sync with the use of a data cable ( a separate purchase required ) but I think it's a shame to spend the extra bucks for Bluetooth only to find it is of limited use.What made me decide to return the phone was that I found the signal to be weaker than any other cell I have ever owned. We live in a little valley that compromises the signal of any cell phone but the A630 couldn't establish a solid connection.It's a great looking device and it feels very well built. The screen is small though it provides a very sharp image. I strongly expect that a more nimble fingered PC user might find the phone's many features to be tons of fun.
4	The A630 is another ground-breaking handset design from Motorola.  It showcases the ingenuity of American engineering when you see the QWERTY keyboard hidden underneath on this lightweight (4 oz.) cell phone.  It's stylish too and has great reception -- that is where T-Mobile has coverage at all.  Compared to the Sidekick II and many other T-Mobile phones the A630 has the best signal-keeping capability but T-Mobile just sucks big time unless you live right next to one of their sporadic cell towers.  Worse their GPRS (data) network is slow and congested.  While surfing the web on the A630 is really cool when the network is accessible for most part of the day the network is slow and often inaccessible.  We really need the govt to step in and mandate that these cell companies upgrade their networks first before charging consumers an arm and a leg for data services.
0	it's the worst cell phone I had to date.1 this phone has 1 to 2 second delay when buttons are pressed.2 because of slow button key I kept doing and unding key lock/unlock several times to actually call anyone.3. battery life is only about 48hrs (standby) and defintly not 200 some minutes as what this phone's spec says.4. phonebook is pretty messedup. phone book name displys only first half of first line although it allows you to enter two lines.5. on/off button some times takes second try.6. it's not straight forward to save work/home/mobile... under one name.7. phone charger connection is so flimsy that in certain position it won't charge. design is pretty messed up.8. 1/8 of color lcd screen is already dying only after 5 month of useage.9. signal is very poor. I'm sure this lot more to do with Tmobile.Basically slow and unintuitive phone.Bright side of all this is that Tmobile contact is only for one year.
4	Wife loved it as the Razr thin phone craze took over. Flip phone with keypad was nice. Used it 2 years with 0 problems.
4	This phone is good for the price but if you really want a good mobile email solution get a Sidekick II.Positive:The A630 has good sound quality and absolutely fantastic sound quality if you use a bluetooth headset. T-Zones service is an inexpensive way to gain access to your POP3 email accounts. It has a keyboard. You can download pictures to and from your computer using a bluetooth connection (I did this using my Mac).Negative:The built-in email software is very poorly designed. It is sloooo[...] It requires way too many key clicks to accomplish common tasks. The most common email commands are buried in the menus the least common commands occupy the prime spots. Someone didn't think about this enough. It takes me 7 clicks to delete a message -- that's too much. They don't take advantage of the keyboard enough: The keyboard has a Delete key but you can't use it to delete a message. That's a waste. Likewise you have to scroll through your emails one...line...at...a...time. Why not use the space bar as a quick scroller like in Outlook? To issue a command you have to use the menu and arrow keys. They should have assigned letter or number keys to each menu command so you can navigate more quickly with single keypresses. (My old Sony-Ericsson phone had this feature)The case is pretty but because it's perfectly symmetrical you can't tell which end is up by feel alone. The keyboard is so slick that you can't dial by feel either -- you need to look. These are safety issues. (but if you have a headset you can dial by voice)So far the battery doesn't last more than a day with below-average use.The A630 is best for people who want bluetooth and who primarily talk or text and who use POP3 occasionally or not at all.
4	Pros:1. Compact in Size;2. eye-ball-absorber design;3. Good bluetooth connection (w/ HS820 headset);4. Convinient input keyboard;5. The screen is clear enough to show a vivid picture;Cons:1. battery is toooooo weak. A full charged battery can only last for one day (with normal amount of incoming and outgoing calls and without any other devices connected). A lot shorter than they claimed in the description (6 days in waiting mode)!2. A little bulky compared tp other camera phones(like samsung);3. The phonebook is a little different from all the other brands;4. System freezed up once when I input phone numbers with bluetooth device connected. I have to reset it by taking the battery out;5. No zoom function with the build-in camera; Can't observe the picture from front small screen when taking photos with the phone closed;6. No software; Just one Java game come with the unit. No choiceother than purchasing more on line.
4	great product at a great price
2	I have placed these in several of my phones since they first came out in the 1990s. I know that they made a big difference in my older phones that had physical antennae&#8217;s which needed to be pulled out of the phone.  Since the phone antennae&#8217;s have changed I haven&#8217;t been able to notice any significant improvements with these installed or without them. I install them now because I got some for free and this is probably what they are now worth. The level of improved reception is about as noticeable as the loss of cash that I paid to get these free signal boosters.
2	This item does nothing to enhance the signal in your phone I followed the instructions and applied the antenna as stated but no change in the signal strength. I guess that's the reason why they're selling so cheap. Do not waste your time with this product.
4	Forgot I had this on my phone until I got the request to review it. But my phone has been working exceptionally well lately...because of these boosters!! I have a Blackberry Torch. You just put this sticky little piece of film by your battery and *viola* you have way better reception!! Seems to do the trick. Recommend!! And it's a great price to boost your phone's antenna.
0	Didn't work for my Galaxy S3 SPH-L710 so in case you have this same phone or just a Galaxy S3 (Verison AT&T T-Mobile) doesn't matter. It wont work.
0	This does not work at all. And once you put it on it is so hard to took off. Never again!!!!
0	I PUT THIS PRODUCT IN MY PHONE AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY SIGNAL STRENGTH AT ALL. I BOUGHT SOME BEFORE AND THEY ACTUALLY HELPED BUT THESE DID NOT.
4	So far it's working as intended. I'm satisfied and the price is right. Easy instruction of how to install the booster inside your cell phone.
4	I do get reception but it added a bar for me.  These are no 'Magic Bullet' for bad reception but they can take it 'just over the edge'.I have used these before in old phones but they get 'lost' easily if I forget to remove them when changing batteries.  So this is good enough to 're-purchase' at least for me.
4	It gives more bars then had before. Such a perfect item. Made my bf very happy as well. So perfect of an item.
0	these things are ajoke they do nothing for the phone but for the price it was a fun thing to try. but really not worth a dime
0	you do not get a 6 pack you only get 1 of them do not be fooled i was very upset that it only came with one and i do not liked to be tricked like that
2	We've had the Sidekick II for about two months.  Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn't have a normal keyboard so you must flip the screen up to press the keys then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation you have to keep flipping the screen up to press 1 for English etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet use Instant Messaging or even Download Fun.  Otherwise all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter A has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip for example.Internet browsing is cool but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display.Oh yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.  You can't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper it isn't really ready for prime time.
4	First let me just say to those who bash this phove because of T-Mobile STOP!  You are here to review the phone not the service.  How is it phone's fault?  It's your service and shouldn't be phone's fault.Pros/Features:Qwerty Keyboard makes it easy to send text messagesWeb BrowserAOL Instant MessangerYahoo MessengerEmail at your fingertipsCamera Phone with Room for up to 36 photosOrganizer/Calender/CalculatorNifty Design reminds you of a mini-laptopCons:Bulky:  Looks like a mini-laptop but won't fir easily in your pocket...Case/Belt Clip is a MUSTButton Size:  Could be small for those with big fingersWeb Browser:  Slow but beacause the sites could be cached it gets a tad faster.  Don't expect cable speed!  This is more of 28.8 speed.No background wallpaper: Because of the deaktop icons background image isn't availableOverall...Positive Outweigh the tiny Negatives by a ton.  If you are an internet.IM junkie you will fall in love with this phone.  The reception in my area is fine.  However the reception varies from area to area.
2	Sidekick II is meant to be your one-stop-shop wireless gadget for e-mailing web-browsing and IM chatting anywhere you go.  You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier esp. the new thumb keyboard but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service though is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data) it's even worse and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g. when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed so if you get the SK be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie you'll probably find T-Mobile's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK's true wireless Internet access appealing.
4	I really enjoy this device--being able to check email and blogs and send IMs while out and about is really nice. However it's kinda huge compared to a regular cellphone and I found that to be a bit of a drag. My service agreement seemed kind of pricey  and the coverage was poor (I couldn't get a signal in my own kitchen and I live in the middle of a big city not out in the country) and in the end I've shelved this phone for a smaller one with a cheaper monthly fee.
4	I started out with the sidekick color switched for a short time to the Blackberry 7100t and then came back to the sidekick II. I So love this phone. There is no other phone on the market that compares in many areas.Pro's -Super easy to use.Best messaging out therebest screen out therecrazy good data servicegood downloads for ringtones games and appsGreat signal (I was in rural Kentucky and still got a signal)Very reliableBest Data/Voice plan with T-mobile -- I have been with T-mobile for 5 years or so and have tried other services during that time. No other service has provided any better phone signal or features for a lower or even a competitive price.Con'sIn order for service to remain good you have to periodically reset the phone. Dont know why but when I do that it fixes any reception problems. T-Mobile techs said this was a good idea.That's it everything else is normal and great about this phone.Unless you need corporate email dont bother with the blackberry. It was the worst phone I have ever used.
4	I've had my SKII fo a little over a month now and find it a good fit for my needs.  I am a business user not a Snoop Dog groupie and this is a VERY cool device.Coverage in my area (Austin TX is good)and while I have not yet traveled away from the IH-35 corridor I had good voice and data coverage all the way to the TX/OK stateline (as far north as I went). For $20/month all you can eat data this is a screaming deal.  I don't find the web surfing that useful (speed is about like a 28kbps dial-up connection) but for email it is superior to the Blackberry 957 I used a number of years ago.  The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger's servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident but if that's a concern limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth no resident memory for email pictures etc no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry) intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email. The web and other stuff are OK but TMO data network will have to get faster and more WAP coded websites for content that is relevent for that to be a big reason to buy/use this device.I purchased through Danger's website total cost $0 after $200 instant discount and $100 in rebates. Worth a year's contract with TMO in my book.  Paying $49/mo for 3000 regional anytime minuets and $20/mo for all you can eat data (email text messaging etc etc EVERYTHING DATA included).I would recommend this to anyone that really needs email and occaisional web service in addition to phone service.  Not the smallest/best coolest phone but the best convergent communication device on the market right now IMHO.
4	Pro's:Very easy to use.Qwerty keyboardOTA (Over The Air) software upgrades that add usability to it once or twice a year.Full buddy list loading for AIM and YIM.Synchs to both Windows and Mac computers.Large clear screen.Allow for export of web bookmarks.Use up to three Pop3 or Imap4 email addresses with it.Con'sNo external memory.limited camera memory.no Bluetooth.no spell checker for the emailNo Microsoft Exchange email support so no corporate email unless it is a Pop3 or allows you to login from the web.Overall an excellent device.
4	I give it five stars - despite some technical problems:You can send and receive vcfs in e-mail attachments - but you can't always file them when you receive them. They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually.  This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory and otherwise are formatted correctly they will get taken. But some applications for example evolution that great Linux e-mail application does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename so the sidekick will not file evolution's vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).Rather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard's formatting the sidekick uses the filename. This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface so be careful.You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs but you can't click on them. You can't click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself then click on the URLs out of the mail where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say With a regular browser why would I care about a WAP browser? - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site).  So you can't browse them at all from the phone.That is about it.  Most of the rest is great. I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site and in openoffice I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express and then imported.  Oh yes I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file just like Outlook had and poof in about a minute a couple hundred phone numbers addresses and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.  I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using but that didn't work.I've resisted all the games (I want MINESWEEPER - yes I know it is lame).  I might have to drop $4 for solitare.I did drop $10 for the terminal program and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device. I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode by port. I can ssh securely to my server. There are lots of disconnects mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes but a program available in Linux called screen allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them see their output get status and all that stuff. I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.Someone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal it took eight on the tiny terminal. In many ways emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode but they both work.One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only sorry.To echo the comments about the AIM client which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client which drops and reconnects all the time is probably worthwhile.The documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed. But many buttons are graphical and unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text or if there is none [IMAGE] the button completely goes away which means that you can't access what the button points to. This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.Occasionally web sites are mis-represented - on eBay for example there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there (which seems the right place) searches don't work.Despite all these niggling problems and t-mobile's hapless tech support I am still giving this device five stars. The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.The difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.I did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh browse at all much less pull up mapquest maps.
4	The Sidekick 2 has a better form factor than the competitors such as Treo 600/610 and Blackberry offerings. It has a better more comfortable keyboard. It's more like a mini computer than a phone which I like. It can fully multitask unlike Palm. You can download a webpage check email and chat on AIM all at the same time unlike  on the Palm which will interrupt the process if you leave the application. Further the Sidekick II has both AIM and Yahoo! Messenger.I like the built in camera and I find I don't miss having a Palm at all especially now that you can use Intellisync with the Sidekick 2 to sync all your contact/calendar information with your desktop computer. I never really liked stylus input on the Palm anyway and again the keyboard on the Sidekick is a lot better. The Blackberry units are nice however I still find the Sidekick more cool easier to use and it has better instant messaging capabilities.My only slight complaint is that the Sidekick 2 does not have a replaceble battery. I would much prefer to be able to swap out the battery.
4	I have used a lot of screen protectors for my iphone and this one is the best. I'm happy to finally have a clear screen cover that works. For the past two years I wouldn't even try them using only the anti-glare covers. Then I would get tired of the anti-glare covers because in my opinion they detracted from the attractiveness of the screen.This cover looks great; you have to look real close to even realize there is a cover on there (wasn't the case with previous clear covers I had used). Boxwave sent me cleaning supplies with the two covers - that made it very easy to apply without getting any dust caught in between. And finally finger prints do not show up as readily as they do when there is no cover.Nice screen cover. Highly recommended.
4	The order was delivered on time and the clear touch is nice fit for my Galaxy S4. I ordered the anti glare version and it is easy to apply w/o any air bubbles. The protector works nice on the sun light. Also no finger prints or marks visible. Would definitely recommencement.
4	Absolutely love this screen protector. It came on time and the product was just as expected. I love how it comes equipped with everything you need to install it. A wetnap dry nap cleaning cloth and the flattening clip you use to even out the protector once its on. It looked very professional and my Galaxy S4 Screen looks SUPER vibrant and clean. You can not even tell that theres a screen protector. I would recommend this screen protector to anyone because the value surpasses the price. Afforable and efficient.
4	I've been a loyal BoxWave customer for years. The quality price value and dust free installation are unbeatable. These shields do a great job at protecting ALL of my electronics and also hold up well to scratches so that I don't need to even replace them. Could not be happier.
4	Just recived my screen protectors and there amazing. They came packaged very well. They come with a very thivk cleaning cloth and some wet and dry cleaning wipes. Once I put on protector on it was really clear no problems at all great feeling to the protector it was cut really well. Will defenetly buy more when I need them wont be using another protector but boxwave.. very satisfied (:
4	Oh my crystal clear... stands up to its name. ..absolutely easy directions to follow... No lint. . my screen looks like it has no protector on it. I am very careful with my device so I do not know how it will handle items scratching the screen or fingerprints..I received it quickly and I didn't have to pay for shipping plus because I bought one item received this packet for free. It comes with two screen protectors. If you follow the directions you should not need the other. I have purchased others and followed the directions and still end up with lint underneath... YES I would recommend this item. ..It is a must have for your phone. ..
4	I'm a lover of all gadgets and always have to get the coolest cell phone out there at the time.  This phone has been really great over the past 14+ months that I've owned it (I have the blue version).  I've not had ONE problem with it doing anything it shouldn't do (i.e. randomly powering off antenna problems etc).  I cannot say that for every cell phone I've ever owned.  LG makes a great cell phone and within their different models I think this one is the best I've seen so far.  My brother has this exact model and loves it too.The phone has a beautiful color screen easy to navigate menus a nice camera and video function and OUTSTANDING battery life.  The only complaint I will echo is that it would be nice at times to have a speakerphone.  Other than that this cell phone is the best I've found - including several other LG models that friends and family own.
4	I had it over 3 years and it was working great. Battery lasts very long. Phone is very durable and solid.
2	I regret buying this phone it's really big and verizon service isn't that great with this phone.  For some reason other verizon phones have like 3 bars when mine has 1 or will have 1 bar when i'm getting no service.  That said the phone does have a beautiful inner LCD the outer LCD is pretty bad.  You can play with the settings. It has loads of features like alarms and calanders and everything else you could think of.  The camera is terrible which is pretty much true with all cell phones though so that's a non unique gripe. The phone is also moderately fruity like when you make or recieve calls the outer LED will start blinking purple blue pink etc and it makes you look like a teenage girl and the menus are all kind of childish.  That said when the phone does have some bars calls never drop and it's pretty easy to set up the phone.  I'm not sure what other options there are out there for verizon cell phones i recently switched from tmobile but im sure you can do better than this phone good luck.
2	i like camera phones but i can't believe this phone don't have usb cable to upload pics..i have to pay $.25 for sending each pics..Viewing all camera phones this one is pretty nice..It's got flash and it's got 4 different types of resolutions..It zooms in more than i expected..Other than camera for contact list it gives you to save #s pic ringtones for a person..I think thats good..i guess that's all i'm gonna say..Overall phone is decent.For other viewers if you wanna buy this you should buy it now and don't wait cause more updated phones will come out soon
4	Ok so I used to have a Motorola T720 (one of the worst phones made) and a Motorola Timeport 8767 (One of the best phones ever made).  I needed a new phone and ventured into the local Verizon Wireless store.  I happen upon the LG VX7000 and think...this thing is huge!  I don't need a camera in my phone...but then I pick it up and play around with it.  It's pretty comfortable to hold.  The screen is nice bright and clear.  I wind up purchasing one from VZW online and when the phone arrives I put it to the test.This phone so far for me has been terrific! The phone itself is a tad larger than my last T720 but not by much...the main LCD is a nice bright TFT screen.  Included are some wallpapers 3 real pics(A Sunset scene an island scene and a group of people scene) a Verizon Logo wallpaper and a few doodle type cartoony pics.  You can change the settings for the display easily as the UI for this LG is much better than my old Moto.  The front LCD is nice enough...you can also set a wallpaper here or use a pic taken from the camera to use as a picture ID when that person calls.Ringtones...kinda forgettable (I am beginning to think cell phone providers tell phone makers to make some pretty useless ringers so you download decent ones).  You can however record your own which sound surprisingly good with the internal mic as well as download them from Verizon's Get It Now Brew service.  You can also use MP3's as ringtones through a little trick.  One think I like...this phone is loud!!  I can hear it ringing in a crowded shopping mall even.  The vibrate feature works well enough and can be activated quickly (though this requires you to flip open the phone).The camera is located where the hinge of the flip would be and rotates so you can snap a pic of yourself without contorting your face and arms to face the lens.  You can also change some pic settings like black and white and sepia tones etc.  The camera is quite decent for a VGA cell phone camera.  There is a flash though this is rather useless except for close up pics.  The camera also lets you take 15 sec video clips which you can save and email to your friends.  While I figured I'd never use this feature I have twice already.  The advantages of having the camera/video in something you always carry is quite nice...it's fine for candid moments and though your friends might know you have a camera phone they won't probably guess you're video recording them. :DThe call quality is niceloud and clear...much better than my old cell phone. Battery life for me has been approx. 5 days with light usage and charges in a little over 2 hrs.  Mind you the old blue versions of this phone had a charging plug near the data port...the new black face ones charge straight through the data port.The holster that came with mine (the black vx7000) was great...solid and not cheapy like some phones are.  Notice that the face of the phone flashes colored led's near the flash when you receieve a call or are making one...some like it some don't.I like the phone and it's size is deceptive. Tonight I showed it to a friend and she said that thing is huge!..then we compared it to her Panasonic camera phone and she noticed...hers was bigger lol.  This is one of Verizon's best cell phones right now...highly recommended.
4	GuysI have used several of my friends bluetooth headsets (motorolas and jabras) and had decided I didn't want one.  Then I found the Mobile Freedom and read the reviews.  I know Logitech and have used a lot of their stuff with good results so I tried it.  IT DOES EVERYTHING YOU HAVE READ!!  It's quiet in the wind it's battery lasts for days for me it's easy to use easy to pair and the sound quality is awesome!!  Nobody could ever tell I was using a headset.  It takes a bit to get used to the ear clip but once you do there are no problems.  It may be a bit heavier and larger than some but then those little tiny ones that look so chic also have TERRIBLE reviews and TERRIBLE performance!!  Try it out you won't regret it.
2	I get significant transmission static with this headset with my I-mate Sp3i unless I point the phone directly at the headset from a few feed away. It has static if I put the phone in my shirt pocket! Since I haven't done a baseline test of the phone with other bluetooth headsets I can't say if it is the headset or the phone but either way if you buy one of these and have the same problem make sure and return it within the return period.Another problem is the plastic ear holder (the part that holds the headset to your ear). This is a bad design and honestly there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear. The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so. Avoid this headset if you want wear a headset for extended periods of time.A final note: The wind blocking technology works well but at the expense of a high quality sound transmission to your recipent. I've asked a few of my techno-geek-friends when I'm talking to them with the headset and they all say that the sound quality seems to be missing a full dynamic range.Good luck!
4	I bought the Logitech after reading numerous reviews on various brands.  I use the device with a Motorola V551 phone (Cingular).  It works geat!  It charges very quickly and the charger folds up in a compact fashion when not in use (the electrical prongs fold up into a recess in the charger). The unit holds a charge for a long time.  I left it in a drawer for a month pulled it out and it was still ready to go!I use the device a couple of times a month on business when driving etc.  The windscreen is outstanding and cuts out noise even when driving with the window open.  some people complain about the ear piece.  It seems fine to me and you can adjust it easily but keep in mind any headset is an annoyance when you first wear one.  Then it becomes second nature.the sound is great the phone detects the device quickly its fairly comfortable. All it all it performs just like a device twice its price
4	I have a Motorola Razr phone and I absolutely hate it because it has low hearing volume and bad reception resulting in missed calls.  I was seriously planning on returning/selling it until I got this Freedom headset!It makes a huge difference!  Very lightweight and comfortable!  No problems with range or battery life.  A little bulky though.  Just got it the other day and a must buy especially at $40 with $10 rebate = $30!!
4	Its the only bluetooth headset I've used so I don't have anything to compare it with.  Has made my ipaq 6315 much more usable as a phone.  Sound quality is good some people say I sound far away I'm experimenting with the gain on the ipaq we'll see if that helps.  It was a little tight for me at first (big ears) I was able to bend the part that goes around the ear a little and its much better now.  Great battery life.Would be nice to have an external ringer on it so I could hear it ringing or vibrate if I were away from the phone.  Good range 15-30'.
4	i had bought the motorola HS820 before this one for $80. i have a motorola V505 from at&t.; the motorola worked pretty well but i thought $80 for a bluetooth headset was way too much. i returned the motorola and picked up the logitech instead and for 1/2 the cost i was just as happy.it fits a little awkwardly on my ear but so did the motorola so i am thinking my ears are the problem. call clarity and voice recognition is good. battery life is good. weight on ear is good. overall i am pretty impressed!i wish there was some way to adjust the tightness of the earpiece as it feels kind of loose on my ear. would also be nice if the on button wasn't so small that you covered it up with your finger when you turned it on making it hard to see the flashing blue light.whenever i use my microwave it makes the bluetooth connection drop. just warning ya'. ;)
4	I've been using this headset for a few months and couldn't be more pleased with the battery life. It recently had no problems keeping up with a four hour Skype session!It is also capable of pairing with multiple devices so you can for instance use it with your computer at home and your cell phone on the road without having to redo the pairing every time something cheap brand-X headsets don't do.Logitech was kind enough to supply a very tiny charger perfect if you take your headset on the road. For those international trips no problem: it can handle 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz (translation for the technologically challenged: you can use it anywhere in the world just get a cheap prong adapter)On the negative side it's possible to jam the connector into the headset the wrong way if you're not careful. Of course the battery won't charge up and the light won't go on a dead giveaway. It caused no damage to my headset but the connector design could be better.I found this headset very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The volume is loud and the sound quality is very clear. People on the other side liked the sound quality as well.There are a few negative points that cost this otherwise excellent headset a star:* after 10 minutes of inactivity it goes to low-power mode sleep. When the phone it is paired with rings it may take up to 5 rings for it to wake up and start ringing. If you press the answer button before the headset starts ringing you will lose the call. If you want to answer right away you can always answer on the phone but if you do so pressing the answer button on the headset will not transfer the call to the headset like it did on my Sony Ericsson HBH headset but hang up. To transfer the call to the headset use the appropriate menu on the phone instead.* The ring on the headset is an irritating non-modifiable melody. It would be nice to have a few options!* The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks don't forget that this is a very capable well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price one of the best out there. If you can live with the looks it's a super deal.
0	the behind the ear thing just broke...I baby my stuff and treat it VERY lightly and this piece of junk just fell apart!!!Very dissapointed!!!I should have made my additions to this review long ago but Logitech cam through for me on this headset in a huge way! They immediately sent me a replacement of the headset but not just a replacement an $85 replacement! Then told me to keep the broken one which I was able to fix with some Krazy Glue!Really incredible customer support...I will never hesitate to buy something branded with the Logitech name!BTW 5 stars on the earpiece itself once it was repaired with the glue.
2	I'm a great believer in spending as little as possible on glitzbells and whistles and generally go for performance and practicality. Sound quality and features are fine for the price.  But the unit is quite difficult to wear -- the boom is wide and boxy; the weight is unbalanced as well.  I could not get a comfortable fit.  My ear is well within normal range of size and shape but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here.  If you don't care about medium to long term fit and comfort or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear you may be happy with this headset.  I wasn't and am returning it.  I'm going to give the Cardo Scala a try;  if it's no good I'll probably go with a Jabra and spend a bit more money.
4	I've had this for about a year.  It works great.  Great call quality no static.  Battery life is real good.  The only bad part is this looks like a part of a males anatomy and I don't really want that on my head.  Otherwise great buy.
4	Let me say a few things:Buy THIS device.  Here are the reasons:- 7-8 Hours talk time- True 30 feet range- Wind filter for clear talking- Small and comfortable doesn't intrude your ear- Crazy price huge quality- Warranty and reliability of Logitech!I've used a Sony Ericsson and Jabra BT200 and I would say the Jabra is much better than Sony Ericsson but the Logitech blows them both away.  It's faster to put on the Logitech and the range is much better.  The microphone is clear and crisp and the speaker volume is loud and sufficient.For me I used a Jabra A210 bluetooth adapter for a Sprint Sanyo 8100 phone w/2.5mm headset jack.  It gave me BT on my phone so I could use this headset.  The auto-answer and hang up depends on your phone whether it would normally do so with a headset or not.  Works great for me!If you are considering a headset get this one.  It's what bluetooth technology should be like.  It's so great that Amazon sold out...  nice.  It was $39.99 (where did they all go???)
4	I was a bit skeptical when I saw the price and read some reviews but I thought hey its Logitech it must be good.  I was right this headset is very comfortable compared to another headset I just bought.  The ear speaker is loud even to the point that I don't have to have it on the highest setting.  The mic was the thing I was worried about though so I called my friend's cell phone and talked to myself and I was pleasantly surprised with the sound volume and clarity.  Also I haven't had any complaints from other friends I've talked to with the headset.  It has been my experience that Logitech makes the best wireless devices for the buck and they didn't let me down with this one (second Logitech wireless devices in two month; I also bought their xbox controller which is definitely also worth the buy.)
0	The sound quality was excellent but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering poor mechanical engineering.I loved it when it wasn't broken.  Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech.
4	I have used it now for 2 weeks with a RAZR V3 and I am satisfied it works as advertised. It was very easy to pair the headset with the phone. The sound is good even in noisy environments. The headset is light confortable and fits well.My only complaint is about the smart button used to turn on/off answer dial and pair. The button is also a LED indicator. The LED flashes diferently (different colors intervals) for various modes but it is difficult to see the LED while pushing and holding the button. After a few days I got used to it and now I know how long to hold the button down to switch on/off pair or use voice dial.At $42 it is a good deal.
4	very cheap excellent value. the problem with most is their uselessness when confronted by windy conditions- this does a much better job than most. v simple instructinos though it lacks the ability to switch easily between headset & phone & back.nevertheless at $35 or under brilliant value.
2	Pros:- Price- Ease of pairing- Sound quality (yours and theirs)- Battery lifeCons- Painful for an extended time (10 mins)- Hard to tell if on or off
4	I bought the Logitech Mobile Freedom Headset (980228-0403) for use with VoIP on my HP zt3000 Windows XP SP2 notebook. I wanted to use a wireless headset and VoIP to make international calls mostly from hotel rooms. This headset did not work out of the box for my situation. The Logitech support website was great. It said to upgrade the notebook's bluetooth software. The HP site was also excellent. I downloaded bluetooth and many other newer drivers. Once installed the headset immediately worked as docuemented. The other newer drivers solved all the weird hibernation problems I've been experiencing too. I'm using Skype for VoIP service. Skype setup has an option for using the bluetooth headset for Skype only otherwise the normal audio devices are used. All in all installation was a bit of upgrade work but competently supported. I now have a VoIP connected wireless headset that allows me mobile freedom. Due to my usage I have no comment on the audio quality or useability with mobile phones. The device apparently will not work with the majority of PocketPCs due to a lack of bluetooth software. Thus I only gave it 4 stars. However HP does sell stereo headphones (no microphone) for most IPaq models.Update: 15-March-2005 Am able to pair with Axim x50v PocketPc. Has considerable static. Skype and other apps nearly unusable. Continues to work with XP well. Suggest Plantronics MX100I Stereo Headset for using Skype on a PPC.
4	Got this headset to replace my Jabra (which was incompatable with my Nokia 3650). Fit and comfort is extremely subjective but I found the Jabra to be far more comfortable (I would actually forget I was wearing it); that said this unit is not uncomfortable (until after a couple hours) just not nearly AS comfortable or securely fitting.Very few complaints as far as performance. It was easy to pair with my phone my wife's Motorola V3 and even my laptop. Sound quality is clear for both parties (recipients occasionally complained of a pinging noise with the Jabra) and the noise reduction actually works to eliminate wind noise. Battery life is excellent. The single function can be a little aggrevating (especially when trying to turn it off as you have to hold it down for a long time). The only weird and very rare quirk is occassionally calls will be interrupted with a strange sound that sounds like someone dropping a manhole cover as it spins on pavement - very strange very annoying and fortunately very rare.Overall performance is top notch comfort is acceptable and value is difficult to beat.
4	I have been using this for a month.PROS:It is a good value.  It works really well and it lasts a very long time on a charge.  The WindStop feature works very well.  People have been able to hear me very well while driving and even while playing volleyball.  It stays on the ear well but is not uncomfortable.CONS:The unit looks okay but is less attractive than some of the other high-tech units on the market.  3 of my co-workers have commented that it looks like I am wearing a phallic symbol on my ear which is really not the look I would like to achieve.
4	Because I spent a lot of time on the phone I am very particular about BT headsets.  I have tried every brand of BT headset you can imagine I mean EVERY brand.  I was so frustrated to a point I was ready to go back to wired headset until I ran into this little guy.  This is by far the best one hands down.  My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola.  I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance.  I don't understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month.  Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise.  Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset you end up with wind noise car noise AC noise every kind of noise but your voice.  In additional the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to get off your crappy Jabra BT headset or take me off your Motorola BT headset.  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it's a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem the sound quality is amazing by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit but it's really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out there is a correct way to wear this and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can't speak for all but I personally don't wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it's behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.  I am sure customers that raved about Jabra would rank this unit out of this world!
4	Good reception. It fits OK on my ear but not perfectly. It seems sturdy. Price was better than most. The wind doesn't bother it much either.
4	We bought the Plantronics HL10 Handset Lifter to go with ourPlantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headsetand have been very pleased with both devices. Using the handset lifter give you the ability to answer calls directly from the wireless headset which is good if you spend a lot of time away from the physical phone to which the headset unit is connected.Setup was amazingly easy just following the directions allowed us to get this installed in just a few minutes on our very inexpensive no-name speaker phone.Like our Plantronics Headset this has passed the test of time and I would buy a new one if it failed today.Highly Recommended!CFH
4	This device allows me to answer incoming calls on my NEC phone while I roam the office with my Plantronics wireless headset in place. This headset already has enough wireless range to cover half the floor in my building so the ability to answer the phone at such a distance is extremely useful in a bunch of situations. A couple of key features:When a call comes in either Intercom or from an external line there is a chime in my ear that alerts me to the call. I can then press the single button on the headset and the receiver is lifted allowing me to receive the call.When the call is done I press the single button again and the receiver hangs up.It's about as simple as conceivably possible.The install instructions were however less than perfect. To get this to work properly I have to unplug the phone base from the handset and in to the Plantronics unit. The handset is then plugged in to the Plantronics unit. This was not explicitly stated in the install instructions. It took 10-15 minutes to figure out the trick. Once that was worked out however everything has been perfect.The only thing that I cannot easily do is pick up parked calls as there is no function to select a line. I can live with that shortcoming.
4	First of all I must start out by saying that I am a little surprised that this little mechanical device is even necessary with all of the technological advances out there these days.  The HL-10 is kind of a throw back to the seventies in terms of its jerry rigging function.  Having said this...  Plantronics builds quality stuff and I am sure that there is a good reason for it.  The device does exactly what it is supposed to do once you adjust it for your individual phone.  I was a little concern that it would fit my phone but they include plenty of adjustment options to take care of any setup.  I am using it with a Plantronics CS351N  headset - which I love for it professional wireless function.  I tested the HL-10 by picking up/hanging up the headset 10 times in sucession and the lifter raised and lowered the receiver successfully each time.  That was good enough for me.  Definitely worth the $ if you own a wireless headset and you roam around the house/office while talking on the phone.
2	There isn't much to say here.  For the phone system I have this was needed to enable the remote functions of the  Plantronics-CS540 Convertible Wireless Headset.  It could be more aesthetically-pleasing but as I'm sure it's designed for a wide variety of phones that need a remote lifter I suppose you can't complain.Mounting the unit can be tricky.  You need to be certain it will work properly before you use the sticky tape to mount it in place.  So you wind up holding it with one hand while working your headset to activate/deactivate it several times to be sure you've found the right spot for it.Comes with a special headset adapter for phones with shapes that offset the lifter bar.
4	Charger works greatand charges your phone really quick! I love that it lights up too so you know when it's plugged in!
4	Walk into your local Wireless store and you will find this on the shelf for 3-4 times the price on Amazon! This product is a genuine Motorola accessory easily identifiable by the cable tag and M logo. Not only does the product look nice with a glowing blue LED but it works very quickly and had no issue being detected by my phone. Buy this now one for your car your spouse's car and a backup!
4	Ive gone through so many car chargers this is the best one and its sooooo fast.
4	I have purchased many car charges for my phones - and this is the only one that hasn't broken. I love that the blue light shows you when it's working - no guessing! Great gadget for very little money!
4	Great spare charger for my motorcycle. Fits in the spare compartment to keep my phone charged while I'm riding. Like the lit up area to show that it's plugged in.
4	I got this to help charge a tablet keyboard but was excited to find it worked to charge all sorts of items that accepted the mini USB.
4	My Nexus 5 recognizes this charger as an AC source. As a result it can charge at the maximum rate possible. Works great when using my phone for navigation and BT audio streaming.
4	this is the first and only car charger I have found that can keep up with my galaxy s 3 while I am using GPS and playing music
4	Rather than wait a month for Verizon to send a welcome kit; I needed a charger ASAP.  The charger was a Motorola charger that was half the price of the one at the local cellphone store and it was the brandname charger. It works well has a bright large indicator light when it is plugged in.  A further surprise it also fits my car hands free so I can charge one or the other with the same charger.  Good deal and quality
4	Got this charger for my mom for a Christmas stocking stuffer and she loves it.  The design is nice it seems well-made and doesn't feel like flimsy plastic.  For the price you can't beat a buy like this.  (Why did I spend $35 for my own charger again?)
4	I luv this charger.  The blue light helps u see it's charging in aux jack.  Fits my Motorola ATRX perfectly even with Otterbox defender case on it
4	I've been using this thing to charge my Nokia and Samsung Galaxy Note 2 devices....it charges them very quick....Love it.
4	Had no issues loved this charger worked great and lasted a beating I gave it and charged my phone quicker then regular chargers
4	First I like the blue glow this charger puts off. (Others have expressed disdain).Second it charges my phone extremely fast. And really that's the important thing eh?I highly recommend this to anybody requiring an inexpensive yet useful car charger for their phone.
4	The charger works well.  When it is plugged in and drawing power the disc turns blue.  Nice little feature.
4	I have ordered cheap chinese rip off chargers and figured I should actually spend some money to get a real charge. This one actually works well and charges my phone when I use the GPS. Other chargers I have had the phone still loses power!
4	Buy this before supplies runs out because this is a very good value. The light is very appealing and it functions very efficiently. I have purchased two of these.
4	This car Charger does what its suppose to and charges my Galaxy s 3 just fine The Light it gives off is great and the price is low so I recommend to all.
4	The blue illumination is cool. Matches the interior lighting of my infiniti well. It charges the latest micro USB phones fairly quickly. I docked one star bc the giant blue illuminating M can be slightly obtrusive. But I guess thats a small price to pay for decent effect. Overall I highly recommend this charger for style quickness and price!
4	Arrived 2 days earlier than stated ETA packaged nicely charger is one of the nicer units I've seen for any phone. Works as described great product.
4	The cord is long and the blue light is okay but this does charge my phone fast for being just a car charger
4	When I first bought my phone I didn't buy a car charger - didn't think I'd need it. Unfortunately I went to work one day only to discover I only had a 30% charge. I had to leave my phone off unless I needed to make a call. My wife ordered me this charger the same day - it fits both the phone and my car. I might never need it but it's nice to know that I have it if I need it.
4	This is my second Motorola charger and I hope it works as well as my first which I had for almost 3 years. There isn't much to say that has not been said about it already and I charge anything with a usb port through it without any problems.
4	Not much to say that hasn't been said already. This is pretty much the best car charger on the market! I've got 2 and they look really nice are built well and work great. They definitely put my Verizon AT&T; and Sprint branded chargers to shame which have a difficult time charging with the screen on and GPS running. With the P518 I can have the phone blazing with everything imaginable running and it still charges. At a 1 amp charge capacity it's fast too. Not like charge your phone from dead to full in 10 minutes fast but faster than all the others I've tried.The only downside (if you can even call it a downside) is the blue light is a bit bright at night. Not like staring into the sun bright but still somewhat bright. I actually love how it looks so it's of no hindrance to me. Also it sticks out a bit further than most chargers so if your lighter receptacle is in a tight place you may want to consider this. But I personally haven't run into any vehicles where it was a problem.Definitely recommended.
4	Great quality. Much better and sturdier than the other after market ones I have purchased in the past. Definitely worth the two extra dollars!
4	Well designed.  High power (1.0 Amp) so it can recharge your phone more quickly. Fits my car's cigarette lighter plug snugly and stays in.  The bright blue light is a bit much but I'm getting used to it.  Cord could be longer.  Fits any phone that needs a micro-USB charger cable.  High quality construction.  Buy this -- you won't regret it.Warning: some phones like the Galaxy S3 won't charge well if the supplied amperage is not at least 1.0 Amps.  Often the amperage is not specified in the listings -- buyer beware.
4	Yep like this item - ended up getting a second one.  Like the LED and the fact that it's a name brand. Works great.
4	This is a great fast charger by Motorola. It's increasingly trickier to determine if something sold on Amazon or elsewhere is genuine product or not. OEM isn't sufficient anymore and most of the non brand name stuff is junk. Be sure to buy by Motorola (or whatever your brand is - but Motorola will work for most) and these are now half a ten spot on Amazon and lots more in the store.My one complaint and reason for dinging a star is that the cord is way too short for use in most vehicles. It's fine for a non smart phone sitting in the console or a cup holder - but it's far too short for smart phone use with the phone positioned on or near the dashboard. I've been unable to find a micro-micro usb extension so I may switch to an power adapter with a socket and just use a long regular usb cable.
4	Worked well and I love the blue light as it lets me know it is actually plugged in and working.
4	I have a Galaxy Nexus and my wife has a Samsung Droid Charge phone and we use this as our charger of choice in both of our cars.  I've bought several different type of generic knock off chargers in the past.  Some that did work but broke easily and some that were so poorly made that they wouldn't charge my phone at all.  This Motorola made charger does a great job of charging my phone.  Even if I am streaming music via Bluetooth to my car and using my phone as a GPS the charger is still able to overcome the power drain and keep the battery charging.  If I had to make one nitpick its the bright blue logo that is lit up while its plugged in.  Its not overpoweringly bright but its unnecessary in my opinion.  Despite this I still think this is the best value for a cell phone charger out there.  Highly recommended!
4	I bought 3 of these for an EVO 4g and a Win 7 phone. My Evo uses juice like no other and using all the tricks in the world still doesnt get me to 1 pm when streaming Rhapsody at work. So at lunch I can leave my Evo plugged in and it charges it pretty quick. It probably takes about 30-45 min to fully charge my Evo from 5% battery left using juicedefender which in self is little miracle app.
4	I'm amazed on how fast this would charge my phone. I thought it was a gimmick on the rapid charge but its not. I can leave my girl's house at 15% battery by the time I'm home it has 80% charge. We live about 35 miles apart. ***Update when I bought this I was using it for my old Motorola Photon 4G phone now I own a Samsung Galaxy S3 it's rapid charge not effective as it was with the Photon but it still does the job. I still like the feature of the blue light that glows once you plug it in to the 9V lighter port. Would be nice to have an indicator to show full charge/charging mode. Hopefully it'll be a nice addition to newer chargers.
4	I searched and searched for an affordable car charger for my new Samsung Galaxy S3 and then I stumbled on this one. I read the reviews to see if anyone tried it with an S3 and I saw quite a few positive reviews. I bought it for less than $5 and gave it a try. It worked great and charged my phone pretty quickly even while using GPS and streaming music. I think that this device puts out about 950 mah which is adequate for most phones. One of the reasons it works so well is because my phone detects it as an AC charger allowing for a better and faster charge. Plus this device looks nice and lights up blue when plugged in. I would definitely recommend it. I actually just bought a second one because I like it so much.
4	Price is right.  Works fine and is durable.  The thumb handle may be the key.  Easy in....easy out and stays in place.  Great for my Android
4	Just what we needed and the cost was perfect!  My husband took it with him to his job and uses it there.
4	I am using this vehicle charger in a work provided Astro van. I purchased this after my upgrade to a Samsung Galaxy SII. I originally bought cheap cig lighter to USB adapters but one of them popped a fuse on the Astro. I threw it away and bought this higher quality device. When it is receiving power from the car the round end where the cable attaches to glows a soft blue color. The cord has a built in simple management system. the two ends of coiled area snap together. It bundles the cord a little and helps to keep it out of the way not by a lot but a little and every little bit helps in a car. The power output is lower than wall charger provided by Samsung but adequate. After the cheap adapter blew a fuse I decided not to put something in the work van that could damage the van further and I believe this is a quality product.
4	I'm using this with my Galaxy S3 and it works great plus it's the fastest car charger I've ever owned.
4	Works exactly as expected. No hassles and no need to fiddle around with the charger. The charger fits easily into the socket.
4	This is probably the BEST car charger on the market. If you are in the market for a good car charger this is the one.
4	I bought this to replace a Verizon brand charger. I have a HTC phone and this works great. I can actually use the navigation on 4G and it will still charge. My last charger would only slow down the battery drain if I used navigation or 4G services but it would still drain on long trips. This charger also feels very sturdy and build quality is superb.
4	Works great with my GS3 looks from the future and the cable is awesome. Great way to take your smartphone to the next level.
4	This was a great buy!  The cord is longer than others I have seen which is convenient.  The blue light is neat but doesn't mean anything.  It does not turn color or turn off when the phone is fully charged.  It just indicates that the charger is inserted into the lighter correctly.
4	The price is unbelievable for a genuine Motorola product.  Works great!  I always make sure that when buying things like this they are legit and not fakes as others have said make sure you buy from Amazon.
4	Seems to be working well so far. Used it for a few days and haven't had any problems. I will update if anything changes.
4	I have a Saab and a lot of chargers don't work play nice with the lighter.This charger had no problem. From my vendor the product was authentic.
4	This charger was purchased with the expectation that it would charge my phone fast. It has met my expectation I forgot to charge my phone before going to bed. The next morning I got in the car plugged in my phone using this charger by the time I reached my my destination 20 mins away from my home my phone was more than half way charged that more than met my expectations. I would consider using this seller again. Item arrived in the condition and at the time time described.
4	would recommed this item for anyone that drives for a living and needs to comminicate while driving.  Keeps the bluetooth ear bug charged for use daily.
4	Brought this to go in our second car so we wouldn't have to carry the one we had from car to car works very well
4	I like the cool blue Motorola accent that lights up when it is plugged in. It charge's my phone quicklywhich is a nice. I also like the extra long cord or there is a plastic clip to make it shorternice.
4	this charger works just prefect for my Note 2!!!!! i had looked into the New Trent Arcadia Rapiduo and the New trent (1pc) car chargers i was reading mixed reviews some said that the chargers worked good but you had to purchase a different usb cable for charging so that the voltage would be at 2.0 which is what the Note 2 needs so i realized my husband owned to of these motorola chargers after reading great reviews saying that it worked perfect on their Notes i quickly when to my car and tried them out and they work perfectly!!! go to your phone settings and then go to battery and while its charging the phone should say AC which means its charging at a 2.0v if it says USB then it too low for the Note2 anyway it worked great!! and was charging at the proper voltage. anyway im super happy no need to worry about purchasing extra usb cables or anything like that and oh yeah they had the holograms meaning they are legit motorola products not the knock offs beware of that!
4	I've had a lot of trouble finding a charger that will do anything but hold the battery steady on my AT&T; Captivate (a Samsung Galaxy S phone) while being used for GPS and with the screen on.. and finally this one does it. It also does not present itself as a real USB device (many chargers show up as a connected computer) which is great.Only downside for me is the fixed cord (can't substitute cords for other devices) but for the cost of this it's well worth one per car.
4	This charger does charge fast and the quality is excellent for the price.  The coil cord is nice and it never gets twisted.  One thing I did experienced was that if you have it plugged in the wrong angle it falls off time to time.
4	Good cheap car charger that looks good as well. Most chargers I seen were either to high or to cheaply made this one is a good pick.
4	This is the original product not a fake imitation. I bought two one for each car.With this being an OEM product I don't have to worry about this unit ruining my phone or Bluetooth.
4	Very quick delivery.... looks great when plugged in and charging...exceptionally fast in it s ability to charge. I would suggest that you get this one while they last. It would be a good deal at twice the price.
4	This is only a 1 amp charger and does work very well.  And you know it looks cool with the light up Motorola logo.....really cool.But be forewarned it will NOT fast charge a Galaxy Note 2......it will charge faster than a standard USB charge........but not as fast as a 2 amp charger.  And if you are using your Note 2 as a GPS it will barely maintain the current charge.  If used normally it will charge but just not real fast.
4	It lights up blue when it's charging and it's a super rapid charge.  Fits all my Android phones perfectly - reaches full charge in about 35 minutes.  Great buy!
4	I got it for my cell and it's been working fine for years now. This cable has outlasted 5 cellphones and 4 cars. Not bad.
4	Great for the price.No problems as some others have stated. Worked for over a year now no sign of a decline in performance.My phone can be navigating on a phone call (or streaming music) and this keeps the battery even or even building (Samsung Galaxy S4).Great buy I'd buy one for a friend if needed!
4	Good quality. I like the blue light that lights up when you plug it in that way you know that it is charging.
4	Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate ChargerMotorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate ChargerGreat charger on the car
4	good price and works great for my samsung galaxy s4 also has a nice blue light indicator love it :D
4	Not much to say but it does what it's needs to do and it's cheat and it looks good! Will buy again.
4	I have had no issues with this charger.  I had one just like this that was issued with my work BB so I had no hesitation in picking up another one for my personal phone.  From all I can tell this is the real deal and not a counterfeit.  Works great!
4	I never realized how much the amperage output of a charger mattered until I got this and my S4's oem charger.It's only 1amp but that's a LOT better than the average car charger. It's not a miracle worker but it definitely pumps juice back into just about any smart device you might have at a great rate.Now if i could just find more legit OEM Samsung chargers with the 2amp output :)
4	I bought this originally for my Sprint Evo 3D.  It does exactly what it should and feels like a quality product.  I originally bought an el cheapo cigarette lighter charger online and it fell apart after 5 months of light use.  This one feels much more sturdy than any I have ever owned.  Also at night gives a cool blue effect from the lighted up part.  It's not really bright so it won't affect your driving/blind you at night.  The cable is very long so you don't have to worry about it being too short.  Great product.  I recently purchased the Sprint Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works perfectly with it.
4	I bought this to replace the one I bought from Verizon several yrs ago. It is great just like the other one I had.
4	Purchased this charger with no problems yet.  After a second purchase for my son whom does a lot of traveling
4	I was looking for a car charger that wasn't cheap but didn't break the bank either. You can forget getting that anywhere retail. So I searched on trusty Amazon.I know from past experiences of myself and others...that a bad car phone charger can ruin your phone...so I was hesitant with all the cheap no name knock offs.Then I saw this one. A true blue Motorola brand charger! Plus at the time of purchase(5/25/11) it was sold and shipped from Amazon. As of today(6/7/11) it is not sold or shipped by Amazon.When I ordered it it arrived on time and I tried it right away. It works perfectly. Plus I like the nifty blue logo when it's plugged in. I've seen a couple of reviews saying they received a knock off version when they ordered from the seller I did. Mine was the real thing. It has the Motorola original product sticker...plus you could tell it was well made.I highly recommend this item.
4	I have ordered 4 of these now.  One for each car and two as gifts.  They work great and do what they should.  No issues on my end.  I have had mine for well over a year now.  Just picked up one for my mother because ours work so well.  Don't pay retail at the cell phone store.  Buy this and save some cash.
4	It does what it is supposed to do but it is really bright during night hours and a bit distracting.
4	Its cheap and it works thats the most important thing. I've had mine for two years now and its still working and it looks pretty good.
4	I use this in my vehicle almost every day and it is a fine charger.It is very stylish as it has a Moto logo with a backlight that turns on when you connect it people always ask about it when they see it and they like it.I use it to charge my good old Atrix 4G and it has a small problem. If you connect it when your battery is under 15% the low batt warning on the phone starts going crazy and you will see as if the charger is connected and disconnected many times. It is annoying but the phone charges anyway so i live with it.I am not sure if this is a phone or charger problem.
4	Charges phone up quickly. Don't always have time to wait for a regular charge time.  I appreciate  having the product.
4	There's not much to say about this charger other than it works and works well!  The little plastic piece on the lighter plug lights up in a cool blue glow.  Remember to unplug it when you get out of your car so a thief isn't enticed by the glow and breaks out your window.
4	I bought this for my Samsung Epic 4G (the 1st gen Galaxy S not the new Epic 4G Touch) since the genuine Sprint charger I bought would not charge properly. It feels nice and sturdy and I have it plugged into a socket hidden inside my center console so the light doesn't bother me. It works great charging my Epic 4G. If it goes low enough again I might buy a spare.Update 1-2-2012:After 5 months of nearly daily usage in my car I'm happy to stay it's still running great. I bought a spare which I keep in my trunk for the day this one eventually dies but since that hasn't happened I'm very happy and will definitely stick with this model for as long as I have micro-usb phones.Update 5-14-2012:Still working great! I haven't had any problems that I can remember.
4	I purchased this to go with my Nexus S after I had gone through three Samsung OEM chargers before it.  The Samsung OEM charger is junk.  The connector always broke and would fit loosely in the micro USB port on the phone.  This Motorola charger also charges the phone quicker.  So if you're debating between the two go with this one.
4	Like the fact that it's the correct brand and milliamps to charge my smart phone. It charges fast and the blue LED light design looks neat.
4	Very impressed with it is exactly what I would have had to pay $40 for on the website. its not a knock off it is the real Motorola. Well worth the money. It charges the phone very fast in about an hour.
4	I got this about a day after i ordered it loved the fast service. I tried it and it works great i love the blue light its so pretty & it charges my droid pro faster than the charger i use in the house! It fits great in my '07 honda civic & my '00 camry would definitely recommend this to anyone!
4	I'm not entirely certain of the rapid rate of which the product claims to have but it does charge my phone at a reasonable rate
4	I needed to replace one of my car chargers because it was wearing out. I bought this to try it out and liked it so much I bought enough for my other vehicles. Hard to beat for the price. The only downside is the blue LED is kind of bright.
4	I got this to replace the one I lost(actually I think when I was getting my car washed it walked out) but..This one was a good price and a nice replacement it was better then the one that I lost/stolen.. Get it!  At this price you can't go wrong..
4	I love this thing it charges my Evo where others have failed. The light is not super bright at night either so it's not blinding.
4	I use this to charge my phone while I use it as a gps. It works as intended and it is stylish on top of that.
4	I searched long and hard to find a quality charger for my phone. I have numerous vehicles and it is a drag trying to remember to take the charger from one car to another. So I decided to get one for each car. This proved more difficult than I thought. There are more cheap charges out there than good ones. So buyer beware but this is a good one. The only flaw is that It doesn't charge as rapidly as the original but other than that it works great.
4	This is very well built unit but it would be perfect if it had another slot for another USB where two people could charge at the same time. With that said it is one of the best built unit I have purchased from Amazon and I would give it 8 stars if it had a second USB plug.
4	Charges quickly build quality is good and it has a cool blue light that adds a nice glow to the car interior.  This is a much better value than the other cheap chargers on Amazon and Ebay.  Buy one for each car and a few as gifts. :-)
4	I have had this product for at least 3 months.My cell several times alerted for chargingnearly dead and I charged it for 15 minutesand the battery would be on half or 3/4charged. Very Fast!!!! Awesome.....
4	I like the power of this charger. It does charge quickly and my phone can be use as soon as I plug it in. Great quality.
4	Although the style is cool with a blue light up and is very cheap... the plug into the phone became wobbly within my HTC Incredible so the phone only recognized it some of the time.  However since it's so cheap I replaced it with another.
4	I needed a car charger. I bought this one. Works fine it charges my phone like its supposed to. The blue LED light is fancy. Shipping was fast
4	The best car charger I've ever purchased its a rapid charger and ill most likely order more. I recommend you get this charger.
4	I needed a bungie style micro-usb to 12-v car adapter. This fit the bill perfectly and even has a status light when charging. Great product high quality.
4	It is a very rapid charger compared to the others out there.  It was a very good pruchase for the price.
4	Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate Charger works great and has a good wire length for smart phone uses. I can setup my smart phone for GPS using charger power source with plenty of wire. Reaches to either side of the cab for co-pilot use. A great OEM charger at a great price.
4	My folks just got new cell phones and needed a micro usb charger for their car.  This unit is solid and nice light with good price.
4	This is a very sturdy charger and I use it all the time with no problem.  The top of the charger lights up when the car is on but because it is a closed compartment the light doesn't affect my driving or distract me.
4	Good price for this adapter.  I have one already provided by my company but got another one for my daughter to charge up her phone and another daughter has one in her car.  They are very reliable.
4	Lasted almost a year (so far).It's the most durable charger I've purchased. The ends haven't degraded noticeably still providing a reliable charge.
4	I love this speed charger!!! It looks really classy in a new vehicle and it charges my Galaxy phone super quick.
4	Got this for my Sprint HTC Evo and has worked great the handful of times I've used it so far.  Not sure how long it would take it to charge it to full but the connector fits great and it seems to hold a steady charge even when using Google Navigation which is all I really got it for.
4	this charger i use all the time to charge my phone not even that but my nexus 7 !as you know nexus 7 needs to have alot of battery charging power to charge a powerful device
4	It doesn't charge very much at all while running Google Navigation on my Galaxy S3. It will keep up and charge about 4% an hour.  I have a cheapo Luxmo charger that charges 10% an hour while running Navigation.  But this charger is only rated 950mah and does work so it stays in my wife's car.I did receive what appears to be a genuine Motorola product otherwise I would give it 3 stars.  I don't think this thing is really 950mah. I have a 500mah Blackberry charger and it works the same as this one.  Find the cheap Luxmo 1 amp charger.  It really is 1 amp.
4	Amazon sent me the Spanish version in a plastic bag (instead of Motorola packaging) but the specs are the same and the item seems to work fine so far (I've had limited use to date though)for both my Samsung Epic 4G and HTC EVO 4G.
4	Nice reasonably compact sturdy fast charges and a long cord. The durability and performance have been fine.The only thing I don't like is that the logo is pretty bright. I have to turn the adapter so that I don't get distracted by the light at night and even then there's a significant blue glow on my instrument panel.
4	Let's face it every time you get a new cell phone you have to buy a new car charger. So why should you pay top dollar when you know you'll only get enough use out of it until your next upgrade generally two years at the most? But if you spend a few minutes doing your research you'll find this car charger for your Droid Incredible. It's perfect! It has the Motorola branding and the price is about one-fifth what you'd pay at the Verizon store or in a Best Buy.It charges your Incredible pretty quickly. I recently was at 2% battery life. I hooked this charger up went and did my 35 minute workout at the gym. When I returned to my car the battery was at a 94% charge. Not bad.The Incredible is a great smart phone. But all of you owners also know that it really sucks up the battery so it's pretty important that you have a car charger readily available. I highly recommend this one. Not only does it do the job very well the price is right. You will definitely get your money's worth.
4	I needed a new car charger and for $5 and free shipping why not try it. Very sleek charger. I've seen chargers that cost 3 times as much not looks this nice. I love the blue light that illuminates when it's plugged in. It takes the guesswork out for me so I KNOW without a doubt my phone is charging. The length of the charger is more than sufficient. It fits all phones with micro SD connections.As I stated in my review title Buy it you won't regret it!
4	Bought for a Samsung Android phone and works great!  No problems with this charger came in original packaging and the blue Motorola logo that illuminates is cool!  Good price too!
4	not much to say about a car charger but it does its job when my phone died charges it pretty quickly
4	This is one of the best car chargers I have had.  Seems to be built well and love the way it lights up when it has a connection in the plug/outlet
4	the Motorola power adapter charges my droid with the 1800mah battery in 30 min... the light does sometimes get annoying when night driving but its worth it
4	Great product - keeps the Droid X2 charged. Doesn't overheat and looks pretty cool with the blue LED. Also great price....you'd expect to pay $30 for something similar inside the store.
4	I have used this on 3 different phones and it has worked great!!!!  I have owned this for about 2 years now and no complains so far...
4	i bought this over two yrs ago. it worked for me. not much else to say. it was a fair price and a good fit.
4	this screen protector work great just i change them every 3 months thats why i purches more in one package
4	Don't know what other reviewers are seeing. I opened the package cleaned the iphone surface with a moist paper towel first then with a dry napkin (my simple way of cleaning the surface) then cleaned with the cleaning cloth supplied (it all took less than a minute) and applied the screen protector. It went on cleanly with very little bubbles that I could remove with the supplied applicator (a small plastic tool to remove the bubbles).BargainCell promptly shipped them on ordering and I got it in 3 days. More than a week now and so far the screen is holding up well.Update: Two months later and it is still ok - no bubbles and it is sticking to the surface correctly. Great product for a very good price (even the high cost of shipping is worth it) compared to similar products being sold in Fry's for $10 or more.
4	Screen protectors work and can be a bother to put on but once they get there without bubbles they work great.
4	The price was so great I bought 3 so I can replace them whenever I want to.
4	I received this card when I purchased an unlocked phone. Considering I travel a ton this was a nice freebie.Pros:- First of all I have to say that the instructions are very simple to follow. All of my questions were answered by the time I finished reading the two-pager. There is even a great troubleshooting portion at the end.- The rates are about $0.05 per minute cheaper than AT&T; but ultimately it will depend on which countries you visit.- I love the fact that I now have an International Number for whenever I travel. I just pop the SIM card into my Quad-Band phone and I'm all set!- The card was free with purchase of mySony Ericsson W580i Grey Phone (Unlocked).Cons:- None that I can think of.Helpful tips:- The phone number you are assigned is from the UK. It will start with county code 44. If people are going to call you from the US they need to dial 011 44 and then the unique number Mobal assigns you.- Mobal provides a SIM PIN if you wish to lock you phone. It's not required but it will prevent unwanted use if you happen to lose your phone.- The worldwide emergency number is 112. Works just like 911 in the states.- You have to go to special SIM activations site (Amazon wont let me post the actual URL) to activate the SIM card. Once there you need to enter in your SIM card serial number and the phone number that Mobal assigns you. These numbers are all found in the upper-right hand portion of the instruction sheet. This site is also where you register and enter your credit card information.
4	Great SIM card and great customer service from Amazon. I lost this phone during shipment and Amazon was kind enough to replace it. Thank you Amazon! God bless.
4	This SIM is an excellent product to have with you and your unlocked Quad band GSM phone when you travel abroad.The coverage is extensive ( 170+ countries ) no fees no surcharges no minimum charges no taxes no line maintenance fees.Just keep it and use it when you need to. Great as a back-up to another card or for emergency use.The rates are high for most countries so use should be for emergencies or short calls only. If you want to talk a lot use a phone card and a pay phone or buy a local SIM. But for emergency or occasional use you cannot beat it. It is also a good value if you are traveling to the UK as all incoming calls there are free on your cell with this SIM ( UK only ).I would not leave the country without it.
4	I have been using this card for several years. I frequently travel internationally and need short-term access to international roaming which my old cell provider did not offer and my new one charges a monthly fee for. I put this in my phone when I am out of the country and it has been very useful. When I expect high use or an extended stay I buy a separate sim card from a local provider in the country but for occasional use I use this. The per-minute usage charges are very high but if you consider the cost of a sim card for each country this plan is still a good idea for low use. I have also used it for backup when my pre-paid sim card unexpectedly ran out of funds on my last trip ($%^ kids!).I have had good reception; it has worked wherever there was any cell reception.Make sure your phone has a sim card is unlocked and that the frequency will work where you are headed. I always buy unlocked quad-band phones and have had no trouble in Europe Asia Africa S America & N America.
4	We used a Mobal Sat phone when traveling around the world a couple of years back.  Mobal has absolutely _wonderful_ customer service.  Our initial research had shown that we'd be in places without GSM coverage.  Our friends with a UK phone proved us otherwise -- who knew out back in the Masai Mara a GSM phone would work?  The peace of mind was great though.Now when this Mobal SIM card was offered up for free with my N95 purchase I jumped on it.  How could I pass up a free phone number free incoming SMS virtually everywhere and a card that doesn't charge any fees at all?  With this SIM card around I don't have to think about it.  I can just pop it in and go.  No need to learn a new number no need to find out what SIM card actually has good rates etc.Compare this to a buddy who picked up a SIM card to be in France for a month.  The card itself was cheap (maybe $20 -- although that's $10 more than this one).  However the fine print and extra fees ended up making the whole ordeal cost about $1500 for just a couple of hours of use.  This car in France? Only $150 to call back to the US - and no fussing around. If you'd just roamed with AT&T;: $155 plus fees. And back at the Masai Mara for two hours? AT&T;: $478 Mobal: $234.  No guarantees that a local prepaid SIM wouldn't charge huge rates for international calling either.If that still sounds expensive just remember that there are no other fees and it's your phone number.  Additionally remember that you'll not be yacking on the phone like you do back home (you're traveling -- see the sites!)  Even my 2 hour example is excessive for us; we rarely talk more than a couple of minutes when really traveling to get away.This card is highly recommended especially if you can get it bundled.
4	Can't complain. OEM battery. Holds charge. The phone is old but oh well getting some extra life out of it for almost nothing.
4	The battery can last for a week when in standby mode.For normal useit's 3 to 4 days.Still I think how long it can be used depends on how you use it.The time you charge it for first use is important.Alsokeep it from charging to long.That will shorten its life.
4	I had an old Motorola Razor cell phone but it would not charge.  I tried this battery because the price was right and it was an exact replacement for the battery in the phone.  The battery works just fine and holds a charge well.  I thought it might be old battery left around and not work that well but it is brand new and works.  What more can I say.
4	Looking for an OEM replacement...this is it. Works just as good as the orginal battery maybe even better because it is newer than the one that came with your phone
4	I shopped around a bit before deciding on this product. I knew i wasn't taking a chancenot with Amazon guaranty and all so i bought it and it works great
4	This is the original equipment OEM battery for Razors and other vintage motorola phones.  works great charges quickly terrrific price.
4	I am satisfied with this purchase at this price. I searched in few local stores and they told me i wont get it. They told me to buy new phone. I gave a try online and I found this. I m still using my old phone with this new battery. I recommend u to buy this.
4	I used this battery to replace the original one on my old Motorola Krzr. After the replacement it has had a much longer battery life and does not require constant charging like it previously did which is very nice.
4	Great deal for the money. So far seams to last a lot longer compared to the one that came with phone.
4	How does one review a battery?  I charged it up and it worked. It is still working to this very day.  I like OEM products particularly when it comes to batteries.
4	I bought this for my brother.  He says it is working like it should.  It was delivered a day early was very happy about that!  I think it was a great price.
4	I picked this up from the seller SF Planet.  The battery came in just a plastic sleeve but is definitely a new Nokia OEM battery with the official hologram.  Great performance for the few weeks I've had it.
4	Shipped immediately arrived quickly works as advertised. Even under heavy use I cannot tell any difference between this one and the one that came with my phone.
4	Feb 2011: 8-month heavy usage updateContinues to work flawlessly phone holds charge through an hour of conversations an hour of streamed music and an hour of GPS usage daily. I have a charger in the car but never drop below half in a day's worth of heavy use so I usually just charge overnight (or in the car the next morning!)Original Review unchanged (June 2010):After reasonably heavy use over 15-16 months my Nokia 6650 started behaving erratically rebooting spontaneously and indicating low battery seconds after being put into use! This prompted me me to start planning a phone upgrade. Being ineligible for a contract extension upgrade meant that I would be looking for a new phone unlocked at a rather substantial cost. I decided to give this reasonably priced retail Nokia BL-4L battery a whirl first based on the reviews and was thrilled when it gave my phone a new lease of life!Standby and usage times (with 3G browsing music streaming etc for 1-2 hours GPS with Nokia Maps or Google Maps for at least 45 minutes per day and 60-90 minutes of phone conversations) are back to their impressive original levels. The battery indicator is barely a bar or two down (from 7) by evening and I only bother to charge it about 3 to 4 times a week! On those weekends when I barely use the phone it loses a bar of indicated charge if that over a day and a half.Perfectly packaged promptly shipped - well done A1 Accessories!
4	Works great nice and cheap built well.  Doesn't charge my E71 but I think thats a phone issue.
4	I was a little skeptical if this was an OEM cord as it did not come in the usual Nokia plastic box but it appears that way.  Most importantly it works just fine: connects the N8 to my PC & charges it.The clip is very handy in keeping the cord tidy.
4	I recently bought a juice pack for my iPhone 4 and it takes the micro A USB cord. They are not too common and the cord furnished with the battery pack is extremely short. The Nokia CA-101 was a better length and it was in the PRIME area.Pros:Syncs with iTunes on the iMacGreat companion in the carSolid construction; not cheaply madeCons:Cord will slip out of the juice pack battery with no-noticeNever have enoughStrong and long enough to use in case of a zombie attackhighly recommend
4	Excellent product. Works perfect and the price is one of the lowest in the market and the quality is just like the original.
4	I own two sets. Works for Dta Transfer PDANet an probably for whatever you need... Awesome buy. Works on mb511 too! I will buy another if the next phone I buy is compatible.
4	work as promise. on my nokia e 63 past Nokia C3-01 past and not my nokia e5. great product have being using it for more than a year
4	Not much to say other than this is a genuine Nokia cable that works with my N810 internet tablet. It's the same as what comes with the N810 and works as expected. Great price too!
4	After losing my cable I decided to order two one as a replacement and the other as a spare. The cheap price enabled me to do that. It arrived on time and if possible exceeds the performance of the original. Love it!
4	Got burned bad with a generic a while back. Make it a point to get good cables. The price on this cable is fantastic considering the fact that it is Nokia OEM. I've never had one of these to fail.  Well built and a good balance between being too thin and too thick.
4	Got it quickly. New condition. I would do business again. It does not come with thecharging cord. I had it with my original equipment.
4	Be aware this product does not include the USB or mini USB cables needed to charge the device.  However if you've already got 'em its a great buy.
4	Bought this to charge a spare battery I bought for my Blackberry 8350.  My cell phone comes with a MICRO USB plug for charging and syncing.  I wanted to eliminate a cable during travel.This unit operates off a MINI USB plug.  This means I cannot operate it from my cell phone's charger which is what I anticipated when I bought the unit.  However read on.The MINI USB input is the typical one you find on a camera card reader or older phone.  So it's easy to pick one up or find one laying around the house.The GOOD thing is there is a USB output.  Therefore I can charge both my extra battery AND my phone from one USB outlet.  I use a MINI usb cable to this unit.  Then I use the MICRO USB sync cable that came from my phone to go from the output of this charger to my phone.  I'll add a picture to show how I use it.The LED light is moderately useful.  OTHER chargers have a clear transition from charging (blinking orange color) to finished (not blinking green).  THIS CHARGER glows solid yellow while charging and SLOWLY goes to a solid green color at full charge.  I never feel you've charged the whole way and I wonder whether I'm really seeing yellow or green because the color is very similar.I almost want to discount one star because of these issues but for the price this device has excellent utility and fits my needs.Note: I tried charging both the battery and my phone at the same time off my PC USB and I got an error on my phone that there is not enough power to charge the battery.  Using an external charger worked fine there is enough juice coming from a wall unit.
4	I like this charger because is very fast and its use is easier than other that I proved ago!! Thanks
4	When the charging port for my Blackberry 8320 stopped working i decided to purchase this external charger along with another brand. This one quickly became my baby!1. It charges fairly quickly2. The indicator light is great.3. You can charge from the computer wall charger etc.It is just perfect!
4	I've only had these headphones for a few days but that has been enough time to really put them through their paces.With my cell phone (HTC/AT&T; Tilt) the experience has been flawless.  There were no issues pairing and the sound quality was really really good.  The difference between a $30 wired headphone plugged in versus the Voyager is quite minimal.I have worn the headset around the house and my office while my phone was plugged into the PC charging and syncing.  That was a very good experience.  I also tried the same while I cut the grass.  That was a great experience as I usually have wires that get trapped etc.The ear buds themselves seem to make this product for me.  If you do not like bud earphones you will hate this product.  Being a big fan of bud earphones I find that these lock out even more noise than normal.  (They passed the spouse/kids test)  This was a bonus when I cut the grass.  I didn't have to raise the volume very much to hear my music and block the sound of the mower.My experience connecting to the MSI Starkey on my PC was not even near satisfactory.  For some reason I hear the mic even when it should be muted.  This didn't happen with my Plantronics 510 headset.  That makes these virtually unusable with my PC -- or at least the experience is unpleasant enough that I would leave my headset disconnected most of the time.Overall I am really pleased with the quality of the Voyager.
4	This unit is great. Very clear. Long battery life. Be advised that it requires the source to have A2DP protocol otherwise you can't use it for stereo. I bought this for my wifes G1 turns out that the G1 does not support the A2DP protocol. It is still great a great bluetooth headset.
4	I love the new plantronics voyager 855. It pairs great with my Nokia N82. My only gripes are that the call/talk button can be difficult to press and the audio quality is good but not great. For audiophiles the 855 wont cut it. But I think I can safely say that no BT headset has great audio. If fidelity is what you want you favorite headphones are better suited for the job but if you want to walk around town make calls and listen to tunes this headset is awesome. It has great audio isolation and decent sound quality.
4	I like the stereo bluetooth from Plantronics. I would like it better if they could increase the battery life. I like the stereo cordless listening from my iPhone PC iMac or any other bluetooth. I like the small size and light weight. I get a couple hours of listening and then have to recharge. It is still worth it.
4	I've had a lot of bluetooth headsets over the years and this one currently ranks as my all time favorite. It is not perfect but it does many things well.  A summary:Pros:-paired very easily-call quality coming in and going out is excellent and works well with voice dialing (and voice commands on my iPhone).- great for listening to podcasts just using the single headset (without extra earpiece) since they are already monaural.- good for listening to music with the second earpiece attached.-controls my phone and ipod functions very well. I can pause and resume what I was listening to on my  iphone anytime.cons:-Sometimes misses a second of music (doesn't happen with calls at all).- Stereo sound quality is good but not fantastic.  Since I listen mostly to podcasts and audiobooks it doesn't make any difference and when I listen to music it is good enough for me.- the connector for charging is micro usb.  My first 855 had a problem with the connector loosening so it would reliably charge. Plantronic promptly replaced it. I hope that was a fluke or they have improved that part of the build.Overall really like this headset and its versatility.
4	The Plantronics Voyager 855 is the best gadget I own.I do not listen to music over bluetooth--bluetooth is simply too lo-fi. It is mega-compressed and distorts your music no matter what fancy headset you get.However it is absolutely wonderful for podcasts of AM talk radio. I listen to that stuff all the time--and now I can do it in any environment. Best of all in this type of application you can remove the stereo earbud and you have a single-ear bluetooth cellphone headset that can also receive A2DP signals from your phone--the only mono device I'm aware of that can do this.The only time I attach the stereo bud is when I'm mowing my lawn and want the extra sound insulation. I use the triple-flange Etymotic eargels for it. It's a fight to get them attached but the great sound insulation that results is an absolute wonder. Makes the noise of the mower nearly disappear and lets me enjoy my favorite talk show at the time of my choosing while getting actual noisy work done.If you like to listen to talk but don't want to bother those around you who may not prefer it this is an elegant solution. They just think you're a geek with a bluetooth on the side of your head and you don't have to tell them you're listening to Rush if they don't want to know.And when a call comes through I don't need to jam this thing further into my ear with the call button to answer it. I just extend the little mic boom and it connects. Others mention that this action can pull the thing out of your ear. But with the Ety eargel it has a good snug fit that stays secure.My favorite sports podcast sounds better on this headset than it does on my car even with its expensive Bose system. Same for every other radio show I download to my blackjack. How nice it is to hear a 3-hour show in just over an hour and a half with no commercials and over my bluetooth to boot.As you may expect I charge my 855 when I'm not using it. I've only had it run out of juice once and that was after a very long session of listening at relatively high volume with the stereo bud in. It charges up fast and goes for a longer time than it ought to. If you want to listen to podcasts on your mobile this is the best piece of hardware out there to do just that.I couldn't get any of the included eargels to fit with this device but with my weird-shaped head that's no surprise. the Ety plugs are a lifesaver and you can buy them in bulk from Etymotic so you can have a supply of clean ones. You are after all sticking it in your ear.I love this product. It does more than I hoped it would and enhances my life far beyond its low cost (got mine for $35). If you have an mp3-enabled phone with lots of memory (like a Q or Blackjack with a good-capacity MicroSD card) and you like talk radio get one of these and prepare for a great experience. You'll find yourself leaving the iPod and headphones at home because they're just too much of a hassle and this stuff works great.Love the functionality this item gives to products and services I already had.
4	I've been using my headset for four months now and have loved it.  I typically use it for listening to podcasts and audio books while I'm working and for that purpose it works wonderfully.  I've heard the sound quality isn't so great for music but to be honest my hearing isn't sharp enough to tell where it's lacking.My only complaints are with actual phone calls.  I've heard from people I've called that it picks up a lot more wind and background noise that my old Voyager 510 did.  There also seems to be a bit of a delay (less than 1/4th of a second) between when I start speaking and when the mic starts picking me up.  It's fine if I take the time to speak clearly but tends miss short one word replies completely.
4	The 855 package contains the headset itself an earhook with secondary earbud attached a worldwide charger a neckband and a little pouch containing additional ear inserts of different sizes as well as two plain earhooks (without stereo earbud wire).Even as a standalone mobile phone headset the 855 is a spectacular value. It's small sounds great and the sliding boom mike picks up your voice very well. Sliding the boom open when a call comes in automatically picks up the call and sliding it close ends the call.The headset also features an action button mute button and a volume control. Each action is signaled by a corresponding chime.Plantronics switched from their proprietary connector to a standard micro USB (the same as on the Kindle 2). The bundled neckband cleverly features a micro USB plug so you can easily attach the headset when not in use.If you want to use your headset in stereo mode (your device must support stereo bluetooth of course like most stereo telephones iPhone 3.0 etc...) simply attach the earloop accessory and use the second earbud. Note that the stereo device does not have to be the same device as your phone: you could pair the 855 with your phone as a headset and with your iPod Touch (with 3.0 OS) as BT headphones. If you're listening to music and a call comes in you will hear the ring. Extend the boom to pick up the call the music will pause and resume when you close the boom to hang up. How awesome is that?This headset is close to perfect and I found very few flaws with it:- Second earbud is fragile and cumbersome. It would be nice to have a better way to carry it maybe something that would attach to the neckband.- Previous track/next track control is combined with volume+/volume- button and requires a long press on those keys. Skipping tracks takes 3 seconds that's way too much.These are extremely minor gripes considering the excellent performance of this great headset and its remarkably low price. Considering it comes with Plantronics's spectacular customer service there really is no reason to look anywhere else for a stereo bluetooth headset. This one is a winner.
4	This is a unique product.  It is a Bluetooth earpiece; it is a set of stereo Bluetooth earbuds.  It is one or the other depending on the ear clip being used.  The earpiece is designed to go into the right ear.  There is a standalone ear clip that allows the earpiece to function as a standalone unit.  The other ear clip is wired to an earbud that goes into the left ear and allows the unit to perform as stereo headphones.  Everything can be take apart and it will all fit into a pouch small enough to comfortably pocket.  The wire between the earpieces is sufficiently long to fit any head comfortably and is cloth covered.  There are multiple sets of earplugs so you can get a good fit to your ear.Either way you have a decent-sounding (a little thin on the low end though) headset that is suitable for most any situation.  The mic mini-boom does extend out if you need it closer to your mouth but the mic is plenty sensitive (almost TOO sensitive as it can pick up a fair bit of ambient noise at times).  All the controls are on the right earpiece.  The only drawback is that the volume rocker pulls double-duty as the track forward/backward selector (you have to hold it down to engage this function and sometimes I was unsuccessful in doing so).The fact that this is uniquely convertible is quite handy but it does have a few limitations:- It is not very loud.  It depends on the phone being used with it and with some phones you may find yourself plugging your left ear so you can hear the conversation.  Note though that using the left earpiece will help with this.- The charging port is a MicroUSB rather than the MiniUSB that is found on most headsets.  There is a charger included but if you want to use a regular home or car charger you will have to buy an adapter ($5~8).- When the battery is low it will beep at you every 10 seconds or so which gets annoying quickly.- I haven't had problems with the ear clips but they do not look terribly sturdy.If I could I'd honestly give the product a 3.5-star rating but I will round it up to 4 just because this is a handy package to have.
4	My Samsung SCH I760 easily links up with this device.  This revolutionary headset has attributed to me setting aside my mp3 player.  While the sound quality is good but not great the functionality to discreetly listen to music while on my break and being able to talk handsfree has easily made this bluetooth stereo headset a winner with me.
4	I've used the Voyager 855 for about 15 hours and I am pleased with the purchase. I use it with an Iphone 3G while working out. For me having the headphone cables out of the picture is worth the drop in music quality. I get some pauses in the music if I don't turn off the WiFi on the Iphone. I get the impression the phone gets too busy to keep the music playing. The noise cancellation is not very good on the out-bound portion of phone calls but I don't use the phone that much while working out. (No one wants to hear that much heavy breathing.) For the price it is a great buy.
4	This thing rocks and they give you a lot of accesories with it. Definitly the best recommendation ever...
4	purchased from a store through price mistakethe headset is closed type earbud almost completely blocks out outside noiseon the first initial trial found sound from both ears is strange and soon realized one side speaker is reversed and disassemble the extended earbud and re-solder after that sound is 99% perfect from both ears as other poster said the main unit should be put on right to get correct stereomicroUSB charging just adds ease of operation I even don't need included AC adapter because I have several microUSB cable can charge right from computera2dp operation is OK but prev/next operation is kinda hassleand I see another problem there's no small silicone flan fortunately you can buy Sony and it fits (I use med size though)it comes with 2 extra earhook to let it stay over the ear without falling off and a lanyardpro:complete sound isolationmicroUSB chargingexcellent sound for both voice and musiccon:AVRCP is kinda hasslelacking small size silicone earflansconclusion the current price is a good deal if you need wireless headphones to use under noisy environment (like in the train) this is a good choice due to sound isolation
4	You can really stream music to just the main ear piece. The other earphone is optional if you want total immersion in what you are listening to. If you are at work and don't want anyone to know you are listening to music then don't use the extra earphone. Awesome product!!
4	This headset gives me exactly what I was looking for. I listen to a ton of podcasts and now I don't have to have wires running all over my body any longer. I don't need stereo - but I've got it if I want it. This product gives me what I need and the power consumption is reasonable too -both on my iPhone and the device itself. The audio does cut in and out once in a while but I think it's because of interference from other wireless devices.
4	I can't say enough nice things about this device. My only desire is for a standardized user-changeable battery so that I won't have to buy another headset when this battery gives out. And come to think of it a bigger and more robust storage-bag would've been nice too. Stereo function works well for all but serious audiophiles.
4	You can't really compare this headset with any other headset because as far as I know there isn't another headset like it. With this headset you can use it as stereo or unplug the wire and hang it on one ear like a standard headset. It is A2DP or whatever those letters are that mean it controls your phone from the headset if your phone has those features.
4	This came with four different size ear buds none of which fit my ear canal. I had to spend a lot of extra money on custom ear molds but now I am very happy. With the custom ear molds they stay in place perfectly even while running. They are light small and deliver decent sound and it's great with the cell phone. The noise reduction wile I am talking on the cell phone works better than any other ear piece that I have ever used.
4	I liked it it was useful and good quality while listening to music just did not like much when using it to answering the phone.
4	Since I originally reviewed this product the price has actually gone... up? If you can buy this stereo BT set for $40 and under snap it up. Otherwise pass on it.I was a little skeptical about buying a stereo Bluetooth for such a bargain but this is a nice headset. Mind you it's not perfect but the sound is reasonably good. It you are expecting the sound quality of Shure headphones your expectations are not realistic. However this headphones do offer fairly accurate mid-range response fair bass and decent highs. I use them with my iPhone 3G S and have found that the jazz setting for the EQ produces the best results. The attachment for the 2nd ear' works great and is very unobtrusive. I think it would be hard to beat this product for any stereo Bluetooth under $75.
4	When I decided to buy a headset my number one concern was that it worked with the Iphone 3GS.  The Voyager fits the bill and has great features. The best feature of the Voyager 855 is the wrap around earbud feature which gives you true stereo sound.  Th wrap around cord and earbud are detachable from the headset by pulling out the adapter and over the ear clip.  There are four sizes of earbuds included which is a plus.  Once you get used to pushing the earbud in - the ambient noise just disappears.  Pairing is easy and I have paired with both Iphone and MacBook Pro with no difficulty.  There is a slide-out feature to the headset which is really beneficial when there is any wind. My friends say they my voice is much clearer when using the slide out feature.Overall this is a great product.  I do find I have to push the bud in the ear at times but I think that is more due to me trying to determine what is the best size earbud.  The only downfall is the distant between iphone and headset is WAY less than advertised.  When I get around 10 feet from my iphone I start dropping signal if I turn my head wrong or go around a corner.  I usually keep my iphone in my pocket or on the counter or desk where I am working so it isn't much of a problem for me.  I bought this as a goldbox value and I have not been disappointed.  Great product!
4	Installation was pretty easy.  Has simple to connect power and ground connections.  RCA's plugged right into my stereo.  Couldn't use phone control lead as my head unit only has a TEL MUTE function;  it needed to use the signal to switch to AUX.  No problem I do 99% of my listening from media from my phone.A bigger problem was the velcro fastening.  The car side velcro's glue was of such poor quality that it wouldn't stick well enough to stay on when separating the two velcro strips.  The unit side wasn't any better.  The fastening between the two strips was stronger than the strip itself on the unit side!  I pulled on the car side velcro and the unit side came apart.  Absolute rubbish.  Use a razor to remove the remains and used contact cement to glue the unit to dash.  Contact cement is applied to both sides allowed to cure for 10-15 minutes then bonds instantly when the two touch.  Bond is like glue on doublesided tape but a bit stronger.Another serious problem was a super bright LED on the unit.  It is bright enough to leave trails on your vision and endanger everybody during night driving.  Clearly nobody at clarion had a functioning brain cell when that LED was spec'd.  Maybe it can be dimmed?  I put black tape over it.Unit works well.  Took call and it muted the a2dp and switched over.  For some reason the call was entirely on the right channel.  Person I talked to said I sounded like I was in a tunnel but conversion was completely intelligible.Unit gets attention of my phone every time I enter car and connects without hassle.  I have a dash mount for the phone so I don't need any kind of display other than the phone's.Would have given 5 stars but took off a point for the  superbright LED.
4	Works well with droid X.  I use it mainly for streaming music and not for talking via bluetooth.  I have a clarion dxz785usb headunit.  This little device works fine for what it does.  It seems to make the low end too loud but that may be a setting on my phone I have to look.  As far as sound quality I haven't gotten to try any 320 kbs songs to play on the phone yet over bluetooth seeing as I just got it and hooked it up a few hours ago.Overall:It only took about 20-30 minutes to completely route the wire pull the radio and wire into my existing setup.It looks pretty nice.The led is pretty bright in the daytime. I plan on putting a small piece of electrical tape over 50-75% of the light portion so I can see that it is connected but not be blinded.It is nice and small maybe 1.5x1.5 inches.The next buttons do not change the song on my phone may just be my phone but either way I didn't expect them too.
4	I loved this bluetooth I still own it and would purchase it again with no problem. Made really well great job.
4	**Using this with the iPhone 3G**  This is my second Plantronics headset and I'm very impressed.  I did get a cheaper headset inbetween the two and it wouldn't even pair with my iPhone.  So I went back with what worked.  It paired easily and has been doing well.  The one thing that I have a problem with is the distance.  They say I can go up to 10 meters away and still not have a problem.  I'm sure that distance is padded a bit but I have problems if I even go upstairs.Even if I'm in the kitchen and I go into the living room (same floor) it gets very very fuzzy.  I would put the distance to where I can talk clearly at about 15 feet... which is about half of what they boast.  The volume on the side could use some work.  I can hear just fine and regular volume is just fine but if they have a way for you to adjust it then I need to hear a noticeable difference between the lowest setting and the highest setting.Other than that I'm very happy with my wireless headset and would definately get another Plantronics headset.  Oh I also like the design.  Not a big fan of the other headset that make you look like a telemarketer!
4	I'm comparing this with a Motorola H300.  Currently it is hooked to a Nokia from T-Mobile.1. It is much lighter and fits much better than the H300.  It seems more secure - the rubber earbud does not block the ear canal (on purpose for driving - you need to be able to hear around you) but it provides a stabilizing point.  The Motorola system is just to hang on the hook - one point of stability plus gravity. The Jabra has like a two point of stability deal plus gravity.2. The hook is easy to switch around so that it goes on the left side.3. It fits well even though I have glasses on.4. It supports all the basics: voice dialing (who knew this phone supported that - but it only works approximately when things are very quiet. Speaking a short sentence is amusing - it brings up a ton of things) answering hand free hanging up and switching a call to and from the earpiece.5. It practices serial monogamy. It can pair with one device at a time and the same single button that hangs up or answers the phone with a momentary press and redials with a double tap and goes into voice dial mode with a 2 second press when you start by being on hook and switches the call to the handset with a 2 second press when you are off hook and switches the call from the handset back to the headset with a three second press and turns the earpiece off with a 4 second press with an even longer press goes into discovery mode (for about 120 seconds).  When you read about how many things the single button can do with different length presses you might begin to wonder will I accidentally turn off the headset trying to voice dial?Yes you will - unless you carefully listen for the beep and release the button when you hear the beep. So far the disconnections have been amusing and have only happened when I was distracted.6. People have said that there are only four volume positions. What the earpiece has is a button that transmits volume up and volume down to the phone. It gets back a message that says ok or end of limit.  My phone has eight volume steps and when I adjust the volume the adjustment steps appear on a slider on the faceplate. I also suspect that on the phone is where the volume adjustment is happening.  So how many volume steps you have is based on what your phone can do not on what the headset can do. (I'm a little hard of hearing in a quiet room I find that six of eight is about right in a more noisy area seven of eight).7. Voice dialing is a joke. It brings up almost random numbers that only rarely even sound like what I said. I think that the failure is in the phone and that this is something that they added to make regulators happy and that it is tested with five radically different sounding names. But that is not the headsets fault.
4	Plantronics makes the best bluetooth headsets you can get for the cost. No contest. I have made the mistake of purchasing Jawbone Sennheiser BlueParrot Motorolla Blue Trek and god only knows which others. Plantronics is the only brand I've purchased more than 1 of. While many of these brands cost well over 4 to 5 times what this one does none of them can compare on battery life consistency of connection or all around value. This headset does take some getting used to as the rubber boot on it slightly penetrates your ear but after a few days you will forget you are wearing it. The only headset I've found that was easier to hear was the sennheiser but it likes to stop communicating with your phone til you re-pair it and costs about 6 times what this does.Background noise suppression is stereotypical if there's noise the person on the other end will most likely hear some translation of it. The mic is not as sensitive as those found in the Jawbone so doing something productive like washing dishes won't blow out the eardrum of whoever you are speaking with but they will hear some level of noise(the Jawbone is brutally painful for that!). I think this is the 5th or maybe 6th plantronics I've bought and I'm sure it won't be the last.On a side note the battery under constant daily use should last you approximately 500 charges or 1.5 years avg.  This is typical for any and all bluetooth headsets. At a cost of less than $20 that means this unit will cost you barely $1 per month as opposed to $10-15 per month for some of the designer headsets!
4	These are not high quality but for the price you can't beat them.  I've bought many of these and they last quite a bit.
4	I have been using this charger for over one year.  I use it to charge a bluetooth earpiece and an external battery for the iPhone.  I has worked well for me.
4	4 stars because the quality is fairly cheesy... but hey at a buck who can agrue?  I got a few of them since they were a dollar and they still work well.  2 months in.
4	this product works great and does what I need it to do and still to this day works just fine and I have had it a little over a year.!
4	does the job what is for no heating issues but the built is not super quality neither did i expect that. happy for the amount i paid. looks good too.
4	I like that it retracts and stays right at the length that you want it to.  I would suggest it to others.
4	My friend had purchased one for me over 2 month ago. Works great charges great looks great.I'm really thankful...
4	I needed one of these to connect one new camera to the computer.On this specific cable everything is done right including the price. It is USB 2.0 certified meaning that it supports data transfer rates of up to 480Mbps and if your device accepts a Micro-B plug this is the cable to get. Maybe the 2-meter length (6+ ft.) is a little bit too much but it does not bother me a lot and there may come a time when a cable this long may come in handy.I am awarding this item 5 stars for price quality and especially for the very good presentation on Amazon's page.______________________________________________Notes:Anyone in the market for a USB cable should be very careful because there are at least 6 kinds of USB connectors. If you are buying a cable that connects 'something' to your computer or laptop the computer end of the cable will always be a USB-A or 'Type A' connector. At the other end you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.If your device (phone PDA camera) is a 'new' one and it's using USB chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.My advice: before ordering any cable make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need. This Amazon listing and most Cables Unlimited listings are most helpful because the Amazon page gives you a visual of what the connectors look like. Whenever in doubt do some more research.
4	#1 SellerRAPID SERVICE!!I had a problem with this produce but dealer was more then a champion to have customer satisfaction.I Strongly recommend this Dealer!!WAY TO GO Thank You!!
4	I bought this for usage with my Palm Pre.  It is a perfect fit for the Palm Pre and let's me charge the phone from my computer.
4	I wanted to connect my Palm Pre to our PC but didn't want to use the charger cable that it came with. This cable works perfectly with the Palm Pre not only for exchanging data with applications like iTunes but also with our car charger. If you need a charger or data USB cable for a Palm Pre this will do the job.
4	I have had two cell phones but was not happy with either of them. So for weeks I researched cell phones. I read reviews and even downloaded manuals to see what the various phones would do and not do. I finally decided to try the ATT Tilt.Battery life: Several reviewers complained about short battery life. So this was my first test. On day one I turned up the brightness and set the backlight to stay on longer. Then I played with it by going to every program and application. I also went to all the settings and played around getting them how I wanted. I also placed a few brief calls. Then I spent a while online using WiFi. I even took a few pictures. I put this phone through its paces for 6 hours and had 17 percent battery life left. The next day I completely drained the battery and recharged it to condition the new battery. Then I put it to work again for another 3 hours or more. I had 40 percent battery life on the second day after a full charge. Of course if I had been on phone calls most of the time I am sure that the battery would have only lasted 3 or 4 hours. Therefore because of my experiences thus far I would rate the battery life as fair when compared to some other smart phones. For power users they do make an extended life battery available online.Camera: Many reviewers also said the 3mg camera does not take very good pictures. This is true. Even though there are some settings to help improve the picture quality I found that it really did not help much. So I rate the camera as average to poor.Performance: Again some reviews I read complained about screen refresh rate or lag. I found this does happen sometimes. The lag time can be from 1 to 4 seconds. However there are ways you can minimize this. As with any computer the more programs you have running the more memory they use and the slower the response time. Try launching a few programs then tap on the memory icon. There you will see how much storage you have on the main unit and SDcard. You will also see how much memory the programs are using. To help with response time touch the Quick Menu at the top right of the screen and close all open programs that you are not using. Plus wait a couple of seconds for a program to fully load before you try to navigate within the program. Also files such as MP3s photos and documents should be moved to the SDcard to free up space on the device itself.Keyboard: I love the slide out QWERTY keyboard. It is much easier and faster to use than the tiny keys on most other smart phones. Of course having a large keyboard means you have to use both hands which most users do anyway. I give this feature a very high mark for convenience and usability.Microsoft Mobile: Personally I love this system because it is like my home computer complete with a Start Menu. I find it familiar and easy to use.Sound quality: Addressing some reviewers concerns about low sound when playing MP3s this is what I found. There are 2 sound settings. One is for the ring tones and the other for the device itself. Tap the Speaker Icon on the top right and you will see these settings. I turned both of them up all the way and launched the music player. The sound was loud and clear. I set a Blackjack II next to it and found that the Tilt was actually slightly louder.Size: I almost did not get the Tilt because of the weight. Plus it is a little thicker that most other phones. While in the ATT store I picked up a Blackjack II then a Blackberry then held the Tilt in the other had. The weight of the Tilt was a little more that either of the other two but not enough to matter to me. Although this might be an issue for some that want a smaller or lighter cell phone.Voice quality: While on a call I found the sound quality clear and loud. There is a scroll wheel on the upper left side that will adjust volume while on a call which comes in handy. I also handed the Tilt to someone and called it to see how it was from both ends of receiving and placing a call. The quality was better than my cordless landline phone. I rate the call quality as excellent.Helpful hint: When on a call the screen turns off in about 10 seconds. However you can still use the Talk key to mute the call or End key to disconnect the call. If you want the screen back on simply press the Power button on the upper right side of the phone. Or you can use the Scroll wheel but this will also adjust the volume at the same time. Also when the screen is off in idle mode none of the keys will turn the screen back on except one. To turn the screen back on from idle either press the Power button or slide out the keyboard.Word and Excel: You can create and edit in these programs without Documents To Go. Then you can either import or export them to your computer or email them. This is a great feature.WiFi: I do not text or get online that much with a cell phone. But when I do get online then this is the only way to go. Plus I can save twenty or thirty dollars a month by not getting the data plan. I simply get online at home or in hotspots. I also disabled the Media Net so that I do not accidentally get on line and get charged a fortune for it.Today Screen: The home screen desktop is called the Today Screen on the Tilt. I did not like the looks of this desktop at all. For one thing there is a lot of wasted real estate that could be used. The European version of the Tilt is different. I found a free plug-in that is the same as the other version and installed it. There was no editing the register you just click on the file then reset and that is it. Now the Today Screen is fully occupied with great looking icons and shortcuts that you can customize.Navigation: There are a few choices when it comes to navigating. You can use the scroll wheel the touch screen or the navigation buttons on the front bottom of the phone. I also found that I can use my finger on the touch screen 90 percent of the time and with very good accuracy. I seldom use the stylus.There are a few other features you can discover for yourself. I just strongly suggest that you read the manual and experiment with the different setting to see what all it will do. I have not seen a cell phone yet that was perfect and the Tilt is no exception. However if you are aware of the quarks from the start then you simply learn how to work around them. Therefore if you want a cell phone that does it all then this is a device to consider.UPDATE: I only had my Tilt for a few days and it kept locking up when in standby. It would not turn back on by pushing reset or the power button. I could only get it working again by taking out the battery then replacing it. The phone would lock up about every 2 or 3 days. So I took it back and got a brand new one and it did the same thing. I returned it for a refund because I have no use for a cell phone I can not depend on. Therefore I can only say that my 5 star rating was for everything I listed above and I stand by it. However I have to give it 1 star for reliability.
4	There are so many great lengthy reviews about this phone already I'll keep this one short and simple.It's a great phone.  And if you have an 8125 or 8525 then it's time to upgrade.If you're still carying a PDA and a cell phone then this is the phone for you.  All in one with GPS a decent music player a good camera and a great operating system (WM6).A quick tip: don't bother with the $10/mo TomTom service.  Download the free Microsoft Live Search or Google Maps applications which both work perfectly with this device's built-in GPS.
4	I purchased this phone when it was first introduced to the market about 3 months ago or so and thus far I've enjoyed the experience and am thoroughly pleased with what I've gotten. I go into more detail below in list form but for a brief summation I'll just say that this is an excellent communication phone with great quality voice calls excellent download and browsing speeds and good email and messaging capabilities. GPS is very well integrated and the Windows Mobile platform is incredibly convenient. The keyboard and screen are also very user-friendly. Doesn't really have an impressive media arsenal so if you're looking for an entertainment phone with a focus on music and video look into an Apple iPhone. Otherwise great for organization picture and file sharing and staying in touch world-wide or locally. I very much recommend this phone.The PROs:The Windows Mobile 6 platform. Syncs very well with my PC is easy to set up and user-friendly once you get the logistics of the programs down. The extra memory allows programs to run very quickly and easily and the Today screen and displays are convenient and functional. (You can also add memory through a MicroSD card located at the bottom of the phone. Mine's a 4G and works more than adequately.) The contact list and calendar both work off the Outlook base which I've found convenient and very concise not to mention very flexible in terms of personal preferences. The best part is the Windows Mobile which allows you to edit and transfer documents in Excel Word and Powerpoint from your PC to your phone very easily just by dragging and dropping while hooked up to your desktop or laptop as you would with any external drive. For the student on the go who ends up studying while at work or editing a paper due the next day I've found this beyond helpful and really really convenient.The keyboard is roomy with larger keys that are raised slightly don't stick or slip and set-up with function keys that are simple and easy to get used to. Very nice for texting emailing document editing etc. especially with the back-lighting. One thing that I am rather pleased with is the array of keys keyboard and front and their usefulness when it comes to short-cuts. The fixed mail and Internet Explorer keys especially are useful and I am a fan of having them at the same level as the phone and scroll keys. Once I got the arrangment and functions down I rarely if ever used the stylus.The touchscreen feature is really enjoyable and works very well without major problems since the screen functions off light pressure instead of heat sensitivity. The screen itself is beautiful with bright colors and large size perfect for web browsing and picture-viewing. The tilting aspect is not of course a necessary sort of addition to the AT&T; line but it's amazing how much more comfortable and secure that position makes you feel while holding it especially since the back of the phone has an incorporated rubber-like material which makes it really easy to grip. (I've also heard a few complaints about the size that the phone is bulky but really I havn't gotten that impression. It's no Blackberry Pearl but it's not exactly going to rip your pocket either.)One word: Fast. Especially over the 3G network. Downloads are quick web-browsing is enjoyable and calls are fantastic. The clarity over the phone on both ends of the call is always exceptionally clear and loud. Even in remote areas where the 3G isn't available this phone picks up EDGE and GPRS very easily and rolls up or back to the next strongest network automatically. The tethering available for laptop modems is also an extremely convenient aspect very easy to use though definitely doesn't replace a high-speed connection by any means. The GPS intergration is also a fantastic option and works quickly and very accuratly once the satellites are found. I've downloaded Google maps and it works very well with the phone. There is also TeleNav available for the phone through AT&T; for an extra fee and there are other programs like TomTom but with Google and Yahoo Y.20 you've really no need unless you want vocal instructions to go with the directions.The CONs:This is not a media phone. I repeat this is not a media phone. You can load it up with music and videos and it will play nicely through Windows Media but it's not anything worth crooning about. The speakers are clear for the most part though not very loud and there isn't a headphone jack on the phone. Bluetooth stereo works pretty well in this case but I have an iPod for my music so I wasn't too put out by the handicapped music capabilities. The camera is pretty good 3MP and takes quality photos but there is a shutter delay so action shots are pretty much ruled out. (I got rid of the shutter delay somewhat by downgrading to a high-resolution 2MP setting.) The video quality is also a bit grainy no matter how fast the streaming speed which is a bit disappointing seeing as how that's a major factor for my catching up with shows and newscasts that I miss while working.Windows Mobile 6 is a bit buggy at times. The Internet Explorer will sometimes start up and not load a page though resetting the page history and temporary files fixes that or restarting the phone as well. There's a delay when switching to landscape mode when opening the keyboard and programs sometimes delay or freeze without apparent reason though this is pretty rare. I ended up setting mine to permanent landscape mode to get rid of the delay since I end up using the keyboard and keys more than anything else. I actually prefer the two-handed setting really. Windows also has a really annoying sort of organizing system when it comes to placing downloaded files in convenient places. (For example defaulting a downloaded game to the Programs folder instead of the Games and Apps folder was just kind of ridiculous.)The IM feature is very slow and there is always a delay when connecting and sending with the server. I just ended up not using the feature which wasn't a huge loss. There is also no push email inherent on the phone and though AT&T; does offer a push set-up I coudn't get it to work properly on the phone so I ended up uninstalling the feature. The send/recieve function works more than adequately though and with as many email accounts as you need so unless you're a Blackberry user and used to their integrated push system I highly doubt that you'll see that as a huge con. The fact that the phone's screen turns off during calls (which isn't a setting that you can change) and then by default prompts for a security password (unless you turn that feature off) is a somewhat annoying but not a huge problem.Otherwise?  Fantastic phone.  I've yet to find a perfect phone but this one suits my lifestyle (on-the-go never at home) perfectly. Like I said I recommend it highly.
4	I'm a huge cell phone fan and I tend to try out the latest and greatest.  So far this phone is it.  I won't rehash all the features because you can read about those elsewhere.  The highlights for me were the excellent battery life and the fact that it has just about every feature you could want in a PDA phone.  The size isn't even that bad.  I had resisted getting a PDA phone because of the size but I've found I can still get this into my pocket.  I'm glad I didn't give in to getting an iPhone because this has it beat.  The only thing I found annoying is that there is no mini-plug jack.  You can buy an inexpensive converter to plug in headphones but it's weird they didn't include that.  Otherwise I love it.  Makes me glad I have AT&T.
4	I bought this phone as I decided I finally needed a combo unit so that I could stop carrying both a phone and a palm. I didn't want a blackberry because the programs I need (epocrates - medication lab tests and diagnosis lists) doesn't work on blackberry. Pretty much the program only works on Palm and MS mobile platforms.  I was initially nervous because of the mixed reviews but I can say that so far I am exceedingly happy with the Tilt!For a palm user the set up is different enough that you can become frustrated trying to do things because it doesn't seem very intuitive. However once I decided to actually read the instructions VIOLA! Everything worked perfectly and easily. SO! Absolutely read the instructions before using it - it may seem intuitive initially but you will be frustrated by little differences that you can't figure out otherwise. All of my initial difficulties were user error so if you're having issues I'm going to bet you still haven't read the instructions :o)Like other commentary I have found that the battery seems to increase in life as the days go by. The first day or two I had to charge it overnight then after that It would last with a full day of use (both as a phone browser use and checking emails) and through the night and into the next day as well. (I've had the phone a week and it still seems to be increasing in battery life...)My only complaints about the unit are:1. The display page keeps flipping to horizontal w/o my telling it to do so. I'm thinking it likely that I'm bumping it somehow with my case since it's a touch screen.(I have the AT&T; Tilt Designio Leather Case Horizontal Flip Cover which I also ordered off Amazon and I really like...) There is an icon on the today screen which you can touch to flip it between horizontal and vertical so I'm pretty sure it's getting bumped somehow. I'd like to remove the icon so the unit stays vertical except when opening to reveal the keyboard but I haven't figured out how to do that.My palm had the safari browser and I will say I liked that better than the one with this unit. With safari I could see an entire webpage in miniature. With this one you only see a section of the page and have to scroll across and down both to find what you seek. Other than those issues I absolutely love the phone so far!A few tips on things I found helpful: (esp. for google gmail and epocrates users)1. Absolutely get the unlimited data plan! It's great that I can access the web anywhere and not worry about finding a wifi hot spot! You don't really even need wifi with the unlimited data plan.2. If you use gmail don't bother with the program the unit has for checking email. The google/gmail mobile version of gmail is far easier to use and it automatically senses you're on a handheld mobile unit and delivers delivers that very easy to use format to your tilt.3. If you use google calendar you will likely need to synch google to outlook then outlook to the tilt - I haven't seen anything that will do a direct synch between the two. As far as programs to synch google calendar to outlook I use companionlink's conduit and it works nice and smooth. If you set it up to synch on a schedule each day then it's no big deal to synch with the tilt and keep everything relatively updated with all relevant info.4. If you use epocrates the program for the MS mobile platform is great and it automatically updates its-self wirelessly through the phone data link each day - nice and smooth with ever current information at your fingertips. It's also great because you can access the web & email within the hospital setting as needed. (Now that many facilities are limiting access to their intranet only)5. If you get the divisio leather case the clear part goes over the keyboard and the tilt screen slides OVER the plastic. I initially was trying to squeeze the whole thing under the plastic and couldn't figure out why it wasn't working.So my take home message would be:Great phone with great web access and usability. Get the unlimited data plan with it and also read all instructions to prevent frustration with initial usage.
4	I must admit that I hated this fone during the first few days. It was very user-unfriendly. Opening browser involved 3 steps. E-mail syncing was a mess. And the screen shutting down while on call was just plain annoying. But all that was until I stumbled upon few HTC Kaiser tips/tricks forums across the net.Then I did 3 things to my fone and my impression of it has changed from 1 star to 4 stars :)- First I uninstalled all the crapware that was loaded by AT&T; (Setting > System tab > Clear Storage... this will reboot your device once the device comes ON it will start installing the crapware that you want to get rid of... so use your stylus and poke the little hole at the bottom... the system will reboot again... and you have a CLEAN phone now) make sure you backed up your phone book before doing this step though- Second I installed the HTCHome plugin... this made my home screen much easier to navigate and much much prettier to look at- Third I installed the Kaiser Tweak plugin... this will let you enable/disable all the settings in one simple step... you can disable the screen shut-off when making a call :)And of course you can install Opera mini anytime to get that iPhonesque surfing capabilityThe only reason I am not giving this phone 5 stars is because this fone does have a tendency to drop calls for no apparent reason. I used Blackberry 8700c before this (also on AT&T;) and it never dropped calls. So I know that poor signal can not be the reason.But apart from a few dropped calls every now and then - I am loving my new kaiser. It is a very powerful device and I like it. I'm looking forward to install many new hacks/tricks in future.
4	I was lucky enough to hear that this phone had been released just days after I had bought the 8525 to replace a previous broken phone. There seemed to be some confusion with the AT&T; sales people since currently with rebates it sells for less than the 8525 and some internal memo seems to have them telling customers that a different update to the 8525 is still coming. Make no mistake this is the upgrade for the 8525 and it's a beauty! Since there's pretty good specs and basic data on what the phone includes on the Amazon product page I'll just run down some improvements over the 8525:1. New sleek black casing. It's not as slippery so less likely to be dropped!2. When keyboard is out you can tilt the screen up. This makes it particularly nice for watching videos on a plane or using as an alarm clock etc.3. GPS built in. You can pay for the AT&T; Telenav...or just load on your own navigation software like TomTom. More on this later...4. Double the memory! One of my biggest issues with windows mobile phones was they had so much less usable memory on the device. I do tend to load a lot of applications and many I really prefer to run on the device not on an external card. So yeah for this!5. 3 MP camera (up from 2) with autofocus. No light to use as a flash though (not that it was all that great anyway!)6. Dual processor and graphics accelerator for improved performance7. Windows Mobile 6Okay so those are the improvements in a nutshell. Lets look at this sucker in more detail.First the package from AT&T; is pretty bare bones. You get the phone an extra stylus screen protector AC charger USB sync cable and the usual software CD with ActiveSync and user's manual. That's basically it! There's no case no headphones not even a headphone adapter. This device does support stereo bluetooth headphones so a lot of people will probably get those instead but to not even include a basic slip case? Pretty cheap for a device in this price range.The device itself is really pleasing to look at. The front is actually considerably darker to the eye than the photos on this page more like a dark grey than silver which I think is quite nice looking (see the photo I uploaded). The back does show fingerprints a bit but it has a nice feel to it and is easy to gripe. The back however is rather challenging to get off. There's no release as on the previous model you just have to use brute force. The speaker is on the back and can give pretty decent volume. Also on the back is the connector for an external GPS antennae (generally not needed unless you are in something like an RV).The keyboard is a full QWERTY keyboard and fairly nice and tactile. Also has a nice light-up feature which can automatically detect light (or you can tweak to always activate). The number keys are colored grey which makes them easier to find and the blue switch key is completely blue rather than just having a blue dot. However the keyboard slides out the opposite direction of the 8525 so if you used that phone you may find yourself trying to slide this the wrong way all the time! This does also put the buttons and stylus to the left...not good for most of us that are right-handed. I also wish there was a way to lock caps and/or numbers on. You have to hold down their respective shift keys which really slows me down sometimes. Also when fully tilted up the soft keys at the top of the keyboard are very hard to press as they are somewhat under the screen.Now on to the buttons. There don't seem to be as many buttons on this model and they aren't as easy to customize in general. You have a dedicated Push-to-Talk button that won't let you remap it frustrating if you never use this service. There is no longer a Comm Manager button either which I really liked to pull up my setting for bluetooth wifi etc. and turn them on and off. The internet and email buttons are now down at the bottom with all the other buttons. I expect some people will like this I personally liked them being separate as I now often have to look to make sure I'm pushing the right button. It's not the greatest layout if you like to play games on your device. I do love the real scroll wheel (not a jog dial). Once you have a device with just jog you'll know how nice true scroll is! The power button is really flush with the device and unlikely you will accidentally turn the device on while in a pocket or purse. Unfortunately this does mean it is not exactly easy to find that power button when it's dark out! Luckily sliding out the keyboard will also turn it on. By default the sliding makes a little chiming sound but you can turn that off.Built-in GPS is pretty cool to have. It does take awhile to fix the satellites there is a utility to help with that and others you can download for free. Once you have a signal you can use it with TeleNav something like TomTom or with various online free service like Microsoft Live or Google Maps. Lots of cool options to make use of this. However if you want to use this to replace the navigation in your car there's one big issue with this device and that's the screen. It doesn't use a transreflective screen which makes it very difficult to see in bright light. This is generally not a huge problem for typical use but if you want to use this in your car to do navigation it may be too difficult to see from any distance if light is hitting it. You can turn up the brightness all the way but on a sunny day you may still have problems. Make sure your navigation has spoken text directions or you may end up lost!The new camera does have the neat autofocus which you can lock on your subject before shooting the photo. It's like most phone cameras in that it is rather slow and can't handle a moving subject. For relatively stationery ones it's actually fairly decent. Won't beat your digicam but it's usable in a pinch.Now on to the operating system and software this phone is using the new Windows Mobile 6. Not a huge different here from 5 biggest changes are in the messaging which handles Exchange servers a lot better HTML emails etc. Many people in the past used 3rd party products for email WM6 actually does a pretty decent job with them now. It also has the new Windows Live service which lets you do instant messaging maps location searches traffic weather news etc. I've only just started playing with some of these features but it looks really good. Just type in a location search for something like a nearby restaurant and you can pull up not only the address and phone...but get directions and a map there as well! And yes GPS is integrated. It's pretty cool. Other various MS functions like hotmail and IM are part of Windows Live as well. Pocket IE is still pretty crappy. I prefer Opera Mobile but the free Opera Mini works pretty well for a lot of people as well.Now for the big negative...AT&T; bloatware. Apparently with all this free memory they saw no reason to leave it for the user instead filling it with all these extra paid-for AT&T; services and horrible game demos (time out in something like 1 minute!) Luckily there are a couple ways around this. You can soft reset the device when it starts loading all these extra apps on and skip over it that way. Or if you are a really savvy techie type like me you can flash the device with the original HTC ROM which is much nicer than the plain AT&T; one. You do need to really spend some time learning how to do this and of course it invalidates the warranty. But you'll have a really slick device afterwards and a lot more free memory. It has a nice black theme that matches the color of the device and a really nice Today screen plugin. The dialer is much improved and easier to use as well. Google the xda-developers site for more info (again not for the technically challenged!)I'm the type of user that plays around with a new device for weeks trying to find just the right combinations of addon programs and utilities to get it working just the way I like it. I've found all kinds of neat programs such as one that lets you configure all the buttons (adding commands for things like double-press or long-press) and another that lets you create custom profiles like a regular cell phone but controlling things like bluetooth/Wifi being on and changing volumes etc. Set your profiles to switch at certain times of the day or for certain types of appointments there's so much you can control if you want to. I was hoping with the faster processor it would load up my Today screen a bit faster with everything I have on there but it still takes awhile on the first load to render everything. Be careful though as all software does not support WM6 yet. I found that clock/alarm programs in particular did not play well with it.There's so much you can do with a Windows Mobile phone I can't begin to list it all here. You can do streaming video (watch YouTube) use Skype or other VOIP services even listen to your entire music collection from home using media sharing. Instant messaging you can even use remote desktop! I even found a website that lets me stream my XM radio channels. Pretty amazing stuff.You'll definitely want to drop by the xda-developers Kaiser forums (google it) and check out some of the applications available there. Top of the list is the Kaiser Tweak which you install and run in order to adjust a lot of the somewhat annoying default settings on the Tilt. Top of the list is the often-mentioned issue with the screen turning off during a call. Run this app and you will never have that problem again. Various performance-related tweaks are available as well.Overall this is a nice step up from the 8525 and with all the rebates currently available a real bargain at that. I would highly recommend this to anyone that want to have a phone for doing web/email and maybe a bit more.EDIT: While I'm not able to change my initial star rating hopefully these additional comments will get posted about the device. While I don't regret my purchase in the least having used it now for sometime I don't have quite so glowing an opinion of it. If you read through my comments with this review as well as all the latest reviews posted you'll see some of these talked about (problems with the speakerphone and BT video driver issues poor support from HTC.) I don't regret buying it at all and find it still a great convergence device. But there are definitely some serious caveats that would make me hesitate to recommend it to new buyers.
4	This is one sweet deal. I have been looking at this phone along with the Touch and Blackberry devices and after 2 months of research I finally bought my Tilt. I'm an IT admin here in Seattle and love my techy stuff. Day one I had it setup to our exchange server which was great because I have my email contacts and shared calendar with me at all times. I also downloaded numerous applications to help tweak the phone and make it even better. Day two I backed up all my settings and unlocked the phone and tried out the Google Bata app. called Android. Of course unlocking your phone will void the warranty but I couldn't resist. This phone has limitless possibilities and is practically a miniature laptop.
4	I purchased this unit a couple of days ago then upgraded to Windows Mobile 6.1.  An easy upgrade (even works on 64-bit Vista) WM6.1 is fairly straightforward to use and stable overall.  (I have had an applet crash however.)It's a speedy performer out of the box though sometimes screen refreshes were a little slow.It turns out there's a brouhaha over a lack of tightly integrated video drivers for this device which is capable of running MUCH faster.Along with the crashing applet (an HTC background running utility; HTC is the company that actually makes the Tilt) I really hope they come along with a better video driver.  This unit is good and is a good Smartphone PDA but it could do better.The keyboard is awesome.The touch screen is as sensitive as my previous PDA (iPaq 2755).Boots fast.Has a crisp bright screen.And whose processor is NOT Intel ARM-based.  This needn't worry you unless you're into using hacking overclocking or other gray-area utilities.  Those apps may not work entirely on the Tilt's CPU.The other apps I've used from backup to office suite to games to shell add-ons DO work nicely indeed. So don't think this device can't run.  It does and nicely overall too.Battery life is so-so - 1300maH is not much.  Larger batteries are available but they will make this thing HUGE.All in all it's a good performer and Windows Mobile 6.1 is a treat.  But the omissions on the part of the manufacturer (the aforementioned video drivers) is most confounding.  HTC is known for doing better.  But that gripe aside it really is a top ranking mobile unit.
4	This is a great LCD screen protector for the iPhone 2G (1st Gen.) I am very happy with this.-Alan Reiley[...]
4	First of all I have added an image that you can use to judge the size of the protector on an iPhone 3G. I know it's hard to see a clear protector in a small photo but in the image my iPhone is inthis case which perfectly covers the edges of the screen protector on all sides so there's no chance of pulling up the corners or getting dust etc. around the edges of the protector.  There's a cut out semi-circle for the Home button.The protector itself is much sturdier than screen protectors you may have used in the past (for an iPod or Palm for example). It's not the flimsy flexible stuff.  For example if a standard screen protector that you'd get at a big box store was the equivalent flexibility of a sheet of notebook paper then this one would be the equivalent of a business card.The upshot of this is that you don't have to worry about corners folding or bubbles forming during application. You can position it very precisely before applying and then when you apply you get a PERFECT result straight with no bubbles whatsoever.The fact that it's covered on both sides is very nice so if you feel like it (though it's not really necessary because of its stiffness) you can use a credit card to press it down as you apply the protector without scratching the protector surface with the card.  To be honest though it doesn't seem to scratch that easy anyway.  It's FAR less prone to scratches than any other screen protector I have ever used.So you get a high quality crystal clear bubble-free scratch resistant protector that will easily outlast a normal screen protector and will probably outlast a PACK of normal screen protectors.  And you basically get it for the cost of shipping.It's a no-brainer. Get it and thank me later. :-)UPDATE 10/10/2008:  Apparently the seller is no longer selling the 3G version here.  My review applied to the 3G version that was being sold on this page at the time the review was submitted.  I'm sure that the review of the material etc. still applies though.
